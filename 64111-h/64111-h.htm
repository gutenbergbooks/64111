<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> Reader who has attentively accompanied us through the biographies
which form the contents of our first and second volumes will not find the
memoirs in this third and concluding volume of less interest and variety of
incident than the former.</p>

<p>The period comprised herein extends from the year 1835 (the first appearance
of Bendigo), and contains the battles of Caunt, Nick Ward, Deaf Burke,
William Perry (the “Tipton”), Harry Broome, Tom Paddock, Harry Orme,
Aaron Jones, Nat Langham, Tom Sayers, and Jem Mace, closing with the last
Championship fight between Tom King and John Camel Heenan, on the 10th of
December, 1863.</p>

<p>In these chapters of the “Decline and Fall” of Pugilism it has been the aim of
the author to “write his annals true,” “nothing extenuate nor set down aught in
malice;” leaving the deeds of each of the Champions to be judged by the “test
of time, which proveth all things.”</p>

<p>In these pages will be found all the battles of the actual Champions, and of
those who contended with them for that once-coveted distinction. It must be
evident, however, that the space of three volumes thrice multiplied would not
suffice to record the numerous battles of the middle and light weight men of
this period; indeed, they do not come within the scope of this work. As these
include some of the best battles of the later days of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P. R.</abbr>, and for the greater
part fall within the memory of the writer of these pages, he will collect them
in a series of “<span class="sc">Pencillings of Pugilists</span>.” These “Reminiscences” of the
Ring, will form, when completed, a concurrent stream of pugilistic history,
subsidiary and contemporary with this last volume of this work.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">WILLIAM THOMPSON (“BENDIGO”), OF NOTTINGHAM,
CHAMPION. 1835&ndash;1850.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">William Thompson</span>, whose pseudonym of Bendigo has given its name to
a district or territory of our Antipodean empire, first saw the light on the
11th day of October, in the year 1811, in the city of Nottingham, renowned,
in the days of rotten boroughs and protracted contested elections, for its
pugnacious populace, its riotous mobs, and rampant Radicalism, succeeded,
in a like spirit, even in later “reformed” times, by its lion-like “lambs,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
and “tiger-Tories.” William was one of three sons at a birth, and, we are
assured, of a family holding a respectable position among their neighbours,
some of them filling the ministerial pulpit, and others belonging to a
strait and strict denomination of dissent. The late Viscount Palmerston
expressed his opinion that had not John Bright, the coadjutor of Cobden
and Gladstonian Cabinet Minister of our own day, been born a Quaker, he
must have grown up a pugilist; a similar reflection suggests itself to
those who knew the character and genius of William Thompson; with the
difference that in his case the young pugilist did grow into an elderly
Methodist parson, as we shall hereafter see, while the Broadbrim secular
Minister has not yet figured in the roped twenty-four feet.
</p>
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pageno">4</span>

<p>There is a closer psychological connection between fighting and fanaticism,
pugnacity and Puritanism, than saints and Stigginses can afford to admit,
and the readiness of wordy disputants to resort to the argumentum ad
hominem, or ad baculinum, and the facile step from preachee to floggee
of parsons of all sects and times, need no citations of history to prove.
The young Bendigo, as we shall see hereafter, became another illustration
of the wisdom of Seneca,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span>
and took to theological disputation when he
could no longer convince his opponents by knock-down blows.</p>

<p>Of the earlier portion of the career of Bendigo, previous to his first
victory over the gigantic Ben Caunt, in July, 1835, much apocryphal stuff
has been fabricated by an obscure biographer.</p>

<p>In 1832, William Thompson, then in his twenty-first year, beat Bill Faulker,
a Nottingham notoriety. In April, 1833, he defeated Charley Martin, and
in the following month polished off Lin Jackson, another local celebrity.</p>

<p>Tom Cox (of Nottingham), who had beaten Sam Merriman, was defeated
easily in June, 1833; and in August of the same year (1833) Charles
Skelton and Tom Burton<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>
are said to have fallen beneath Bendigo’s conquering
fist. Moreover (surely his biographer is poking fun at us) he is
credited with beating Bill Mason in Sept. 1833, and Bill Winterflood in
October! Now as we know no Bill Winterflood except Bill Moulds, the
Bath champion, and he never met Bendigo at all, are we not justified in
rejecting such “history”?</p>

<p>The last in this list is a defeat of one Bingham, who is set down as
“Champion,” in January, 1834, which brings us near enough to Bendigo’s
first appearance in the blue posted rails of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P. R.</abbr> with Caunt on July
21st, 1835. On that day, we read&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“A fight took place in the Nottingham district between two youngsters
who were both fated to develop into Champions of England. The meeting-place
was near Appleby House, on the Ashbourne Road, about thirty
miles from Nottingham.” Both men were natives of Nottinghamshire; the
elder one, William Thompson, hailing from the county town; while the
younger, Benjamin Caunt, was a native of the village of Hucknall, where
his parents had been tenants of the poet, Lord Byron&mdash;&#8203;a fact of which the
athlete was always intensely proud. Caunt on this occasion made his first
appearance in any ring, and having been born on the 22nd of March, 1815,
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pageno">5</span>
had only just completed his twenty-first year, and had therefore a very considerable
disadvantage in point of age. On the other hand, he was a
youngster of herculean proportions and giant strength; stood 6<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> 2<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr>
in height, and his fighting weight was 14<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> Thus, in point of size, it
was a horse to a hen; but Caunt had no science at all, while Bendigo had
a very considerable share of it. The big ’un was seconded by Butler
(Caunt’s uncle) and Bamford, and Bendigo by Turner and Merryman.
Throughout twenty-two rounds Caunt stood up with indomitable pluck and
perseverance to receive a long way the lion’s share of the punishment,
while his shifty opponent always avoided the return by getting down.
Caunt at last, in a rage at these tactics, which he could not counteract or
endure, rushed across the ring, called on him to stand up, before the call of
“Time” by the umpires, and then struck Bendigo before he rose from his
second’s knee. The referee and umpires having decided that this blow was
foul, the stakes, £25 a side, were awarded to Bendigo. “It was the expressed
opinion of the spectators that, had Caunt kept his temper and
husbanded his strength, the issue would have gone the other way, as he
proved himself game to the backbone, while his opponent was made up of
dodges from heel to headpiece.”</p>

<p>This fight had the effect of calling the attention of backers to both men.
Of Bendigo’s cleverness there could be no question, while Caunt’s enormous
strength and unflinching pluck were equally indisputable; and it is a
curious illustration of the circular theory of events that these two men,
whose pugilistic career may fairly be said to have commenced in this fight&mdash;&#8203;when
they were, of course, at the bottom of the ladder&mdash;&#8203;should meet
again when they were half-way up, and a third time when they stood on
the topmost round.</p>

<p>This victory over the gigantic wrestler of Hucknall Torkard could not
fail to bring his conqueror prominently before the eyes of the boxing
world. John Leechman, alias Brassey, of Bradford (of whom hereafter),
Charley Langan, Looney, of Liverpool, Bob Hampson, also of Liverpool&mdash;&#8203;indeed,
all the big ’uns of the “North Countrie” were anxious to have a
shy at the audacious 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> man who had beaten Ben the Giant.</p>

<p>In November, 1835, Brassey, of Bradford, announced by letter in <cite>Bell’s
Life</cite>, that he was prepared to meet Bendigo half-way between Nottingham
and the Yorkshire town for £50 a side. But the erratic Bendigo was
wandering about the country, exhibiting with Peter Taylor, Sam Pixton,
Levi Eckersley, &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, electrifying the yokels by his tricks of agility and
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">6</span>
strength, and his irrepressible chaff and natural humour&mdash;&#8203;gifts which made
him, formidable as he really was, a sort of practical clown to the boxing
ring. Hence nothing came of the challenges and appointments, although
Bendigo, by a letter in a Midland sporting paper, in February, 1836, declared
himself ready to make a match for £25 a side with Tom Britton or
Jem Corbett&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo to be under 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> on the day. He also threw down
the gauntlet to “any 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> man in the four counties of Nottingham,
Leicester, Derbyshire, and Lincolnshire; money ready at his sporting house
in Sheffield”&mdash;&#8203;a rather amusing challenge, as it excluded Brassey, of
Bradford, and three well-known Lancashire heavy weights. Tom Britton
replied to this challenge that he would not fight under £100, being engaged
in business; but informed Bendigo that he could find two 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> candidates
for his favours for £25 or £50, if he would attend at the “Grapes,”
Peter Street, Liverpool.</p>

<p>John Leechman (Brassey) now came out with a definite cartel, that he
was open to fight any 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> man within 100 miles of Bradford for £25 or
£50, and that his money was ready at the “Stag’s Head,” Preston Street,
Sheffield. This brought Bendigo to the scratch, and the match was made
for £25 a side, to come off on Tuesday, May 24th, 1836. The deposits
were duly made, and on the appointed day, May 24th, 1836, the men met
nine miles from Sheffield, on the Doncaster road. No reliable report of
this fight, which was for £25 a side, is extant: nothing beyond a paragraph
in the following week’s papers, declaring it to be won by Bendigo,
“after a severe contest of 52 rounds, in which the superiority of science was
on the side of the lesser man, Bendigo weighing 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 12<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, Brassey
nearly 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>”</p>

<p>Brassey and his friends were not satisfied with this defeat, and immediately
proposed a fresh match for £50; and Jem Bailey (not of Bristol,
but an Irishman, afterwards twice beaten by Brassey) also challenged
Bendigo. Bendigo accepted Bailey’s offer, but Paddy’s friends hung back
and forfeited the deposit.</p>

<p>Our hero now visited London, and was for some weeks an object of some
curiosity, putting up at Jem Burn’s, where he kept the company alive by
his eccentric “patter.” Jem offered to back Bendigo against Fitzmaurice
(who had been beaten by Deaf Burke), but Fitz’s friends also backed out.
It may be remarked, par parenthese, that the Deaf ’un was in America
during this paper warfare.</p>

<p>At this period a remarkably clever eleven stone black, hight Jem

Wharton, who fought under the names of “Young Molyneux,” and “The
Morocco Prince,” had successively polished off Tom M’Keevor, Evans,
Wilsden, and Bill Fisher, and fought a gallant drawn battle of <em>four hours
and seven minutes</em>, and 200 rounds, with the game Tom Britton, was the talk
of the provincial fancy. A match was proposed for £50, half-way between
Nottingham and London. But in the interval of talk Molyneux got matched
with Harry Preston, and a most interesting fight, from the crafty style of
both men, was lost for ever. A forfeit in the interim was paid to Bendigo
by Flint, of Coventry.</p>

<p>Molyneux also accepted Bendy’s offer, but insisted on raising the stakes
to £100 a side, and to Bendy confining himself to 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> (!) Molyneux
not to exceed 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 2<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera, et cetera">&amp;c., &amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>To these stipulations Bendy replied: “My Liverpool friends will back
me £100 to £80, or £50 to £40, at catch weight, against Young Molyneux.
I shall be in London in a few weeks, and shall be happy to meet Luke
Rogers for £50 or £100, as Looney’s match is off, owing to his being under
lock and key for his day’s amusement with Bob Hampson.&mdash;&#8203;Nottingham,
November 25, 1836.” Molyneux got matched with Bailey, of Manchester,
and this second affair fell through.</p>

<p>At length, in December, articles were signed with Young Langan
(Charley), of Liverpool, to fight within two months, catch weight, and the
day fixed for the 24th of January, 1837, when the men met at Woore, eight
miles from Newcastle, in Staffordshire. At a few minutes to one o’clock
Bendy appeared, esquired by Harris Birchall and Jem Corbett; Young
Langan waited on by two of his countrymen. Langan weighed within
2<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> of 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>; Bendigo 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> on this occasion. The battle was a
characteristic one. The “long ’un,” as he was called by the bystanders,
began by “forcing the fighting,” a game which suited the active and shifty
Bendigo, who punished his opponent fearfully for almost every rush.
Cautioned by his friends, Langan tried “out-fighting,” but Bendy was not
to be cajoled into countering with so long-armed and heavy an opponent.
He feigned weakness, and Langan, being encouraged to “go in,” found he
had indeed “caught a Tartar.” He was upper-cut, fibbed, and thrown,
until, “blind as a pup,” his seconds gave in for him at the close of the 92nd
round, and one hour and thirty-three minutes.</p>

<p>Negotiations with Tom Britton, of Liverpool, fell through, as Britton
could not come up to Bendy’s minimum of £100 a side.</p>

<p>Bendigo and his trainer, Peter Taylor, were now in high favour, and a
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pageno">8</span>
sparring tour among the Lancashire and Yorkshire tykes was organised
and arranged. Bendigo also wrote in the London and provincial papers
that he was “ready to fight any man in England at 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> for £50 to
£100 a side; and, as he is really in want of a job, he will not refuse any
12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> customer, and will not himself exceed 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> Money always ready.”</p>

<p>At this period Looney, declaring that Bendigo had shuffled out of
meeting him for £50, claimed the Championship in a boastful letter. This
was too much for Jem Ward, who then kept the “Star” tavern in Williamson
Square, Liverpool; so he addressed an epistle to the editor of
<cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, offering to meet Mr. Looney for £200, “if there is no big ’un
to save the title of Champion from the degradation into which it has
fallen.”</p>

<p>Ward’s letter had the effect of leading to a meeting of Looney’s friends,
whereat that boxer discreetly declared that he never meant to include
Ward in his general challenge for £100 or £200, as he considered that
Ward had retired. Barring, therefore, Ward, Mister Looney renewed
his claim. Hereupon a gentleman from Nottingham, disputing Looney’s
claim to fight for “a Championship stake,” offered to back Bendigo against
him for £50 a side and “as much more as he could get.” This was
closed with, and a deposit made. On the following Tuesday, at Matt Robinson’s,
“Molly Moloney” tavern, Liverpool, articles were signed for £50 a
side (afterwards increased to £100), to fight on the 13th of June, 1837,
half-way between Nottingham and Liverpool. A spot near Chapel-en-le-Frith,
Derbyshire, was the rendezvous, and thither the men repaired.
Looney arrived in Manchester from his training-quarters at Aintree, and
Bendigo from Crosby, on the overnight, when there was some spirited
betting at five and occasionally six to four on Looney.</p>

<p>The next morning proving beautifully fine brought hundreds from distant
parts to the spot, in the usual description of drags, until there was not
a stable left wherein to rest a jaded prad, or a bit of hay or corn in many
places to eat. Looney had fought many battles, the most conspicuous of
which were with Fisher (whom he defeated twice, and another ended in a
wrangle) and Bob Hampson, who suffered defeat three times by him.
Bendigo, as we have seen, had scored victories over Caunt, Brassey, and young
Langan. A little after eleven the magnets of the day left their hotels, and
were immediately followed by an immense body on foot to the summit of
a rasping hill, where a most excellent inner and outer ring was formed with
new ropes and stakes, the latter being painted sky blue; near the top were
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pageno">9</span>
the letters L. <abbr title="Prize Ring">P. R.</abbr> (signifying Liverpool Prize Ring), encircled in a
wreath of gold; the one to which the handkerchiefs were attached was,
with the crown, gilt. Soon after twelve o’clock the men entered the ring
amidst the cheers of their friends&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo first. They good-humouredly
shook hands, and proceeded to peel. Young Molyneux (who was loudly
cheered), along with Joe Birchall, appeared for Looney, whilst Peter Taylor
and Young Langan were the assistants of Bendigo. The colours&mdash;&#8203;green and
gold for Looney; blue bird’s-eye for Bendigo. A little after one o’clock,
the betting being five to four on Looney, with many takers, commenced</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;The appearance of Bendigo, on
coming to the scratch, was of the first order,
and as fair as a lily, whilst Looney displayed
a scorbutic eruption on his back. Both seeming
confident of victory put up their fives,
caution and “stock-taking” for a few
moments being the order of the day. Looney
made a half-round right-hander, which told
slightly on the ear. He then made three
hits at the head and body, which Bendigo
stepped away from, and dropped a little
left ’un on the chin. Bendigo was not idle,
but on the defensive, and succeeded in putting
in two left-handers on the canister, and
blood, the first, made its appearance from
the mouth and under the left eye of Looney.
This was a long round; in the close Bendigo
was thrown.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Looney, all anxious, made play left
and right; one told on the ear, a scramble,
both fighting; Bendigo thrown, but fell cat
fashion.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo put the staggers on Looney
with a left-handed poke on the head; closed,
and both down on their sides.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Both came up smiling. Bendigo made
two short hits, had his left intended for the
“attic” stopped, but put in a straight one
on the breast, and the round finished by both
men hammering away right and left in
splendid style until Looney was sent down.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Two light body blows were exchanged,
and Looney was thrown.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo got away from two right-handers,
received a little one on the left ear,
and both down one over the other.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Looney made two short hits with the
left; Bendigo stopped his right at the ear;
some capital in-fighting took place, in which
Looney got his right eye out, and Bendigo
slipped down.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;This was another good round, but in
the end Bendigo got his man on the ropes in
such a position as to operate pretty freely on
his face, and showers of “claret” were the
consequence. Looney fell through the ropes,
Bendigo over him.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Looney came up as gay as possible,
with two to one against him, and a slashing
round ended in favour of Bendigo; Looney
down.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo sent home a tremendous
whack on the left eye, which drew claret.
Looney seemed amazed, and put up his hand
to “wipe away the tear.” Looney thrown.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;A very long struggle on the ropes, in
which Looney appeared awkwardly situated,
but he got down with little damage.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Up to this round there was not a
visible mark of punishment on Bendigo.
Looney put in two hits on the left ear, but
was thrown through the ropes, Bendigo over
him.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Looney hit short with his right on
the body, but was more successful in the next
effort; planted it on the ribs, and staggered
Bendigo to the ropes, where both struggled
down.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;A capital round, in which some heavy
hits were exchanged, and Looney fell.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Looney staggered his man again with
his right, and, in making another hit, Bendigo
dropped on his nether end, throwing up
his legs and laughing. (Great disapprobation.)</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Looney again delivered his right on
the ribs. Bendigo bored him to the ropes,
and Looney got down.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Looney put in two smart hits on the
left ear, and one on the ribs. Bendigo
dropped on his knees.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo pressed Looney on the ropes,
held him for some time in a helpless position,
and gave it him severely in the face,
the claret flowing copiously. He was lowered
to the earth by a little stratagem on the part
of his seconds.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Notwithstanding the loss of blood in
the last round, Looney was lively to the call,
went up to his man, and knocked him through
the ropes with a body blow.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Looney caught his man with his right;
a struggle on the ropes in favour of Bendigo.
Both down.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Another struggle on the ropes, in
which Bendigo was forced through.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;A rallying round, which Looney
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pageno">10</span>
finished by knocking his man through the
rope by a blow on the breast.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Looney again put in his right;
another struggle on the ropes, until they
were forced to the ground.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Looney rushed in and was going to
work when Bendigo fell.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo put in a smart hit on the
face, caught it in return on the head, and
was thrown over the ropes.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo popped in three very heavy
hits on the face, put three hits on the body,
and went down as if weak.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Looney hit short. Bendigo gave it
him on the conk, and threw him a clever
somersault.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Looney put in his right heavily on the
ribs, which compliment was returned by a
stinger on the head, which staggered him down.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;Both got to a close, and Bendigo was
thrown, coming on his head.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;A slashing round; give and take was
“the ticket” on the ribs and head, until
both went down weak.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Both got to the ropes, and went down
together. Ditto the next round.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo put in two facers, and threw
his man heavily.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;After an exchange, Bendigo caught
hold and threw Looney heavily.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo got on the ropes, and Looney
dragged him down on his back.</p>

<p>     36, 37.&mdash;&#8203;Two struggling rounds at the
ropes; Looney under in the falls.</p>

<p>     38.&mdash;&#8203;Looney planted a nasty one on the
ribs, followed his man up, and forced Bendigo
through the ropes.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;Looney planted three tidy hits on the
head and body, as did Bendigo on the mug,
again tapping the claret; but in the end was
whirled on the ground.</p>

<p>     40.&mdash;&#8203;A rally in favour of Bendigo, who
threw Looney.</p>

<p>     41.&mdash;&#8203;Looney caught Bendigo’s head, put in
a smart upper cut, but was thrown clean.</p>

<p>     42.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo’s left arm appeared a little
black from the effects of Looney’s right, as
did his ear, but with the exception of a small
bump on his left eye he had not a scratch
on his face, whilst Looney’s phiz began to
assume a frightful aspect, his left eye completely
closed, with a terrible gash over it,
one under, another over his right, and his
nose and mouth in a shocking state of disorder.
Still he was game and confident of
the victory; he rushed in, put in two
sharpish hits on the head, and downed
Bendigo in a heap on the grass.</p>

<p>     43.&mdash;&#8203;Body blows exchanged. Bendigo
under in the fall.</p>

<p>     44.&mdash;&#8203;A rally in favour of Bendigo, in
which Looney clasped him round the legs;
but it was considered more by accident than
design. He let go, and went down.</p>

<p>     45.&mdash;&#8203;Looney rushed in, and in the struggle
went down on his nether end.</p>

<p>     46, 47, 48, 49.&mdash;&#8203;Struggling rounds&mdash;&#8203;favour
of Bendigo.</p>

<p>     50.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo shot out his left, and, in
going down, Looney caught his head, but, not
observing Hoyle’s rule of “when in doubt
take the trick,” held back his fist, and let
him go.</p>

<p>     51.&mdash;&#8203;Looney popped one in the ear, but
was thrown through the ropes.</p>

<p>     52, 53, 54.&mdash;&#8203;Nothing done. In the latter
Looney missed a heavy upper cut, and swung
himself through the ropes.</p>

<p>     55.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo got Looney’s head in chancery,
peppered away, and again the crimson
stream flowed. Both down.</p>

<p>     56.&mdash;&#8203;A struggle. Both down.</p>

<p>     57.&mdash;&#8203;A close, in which Looney threw Bendigo
a burster, with his head doubled under.</p>

<p>     58.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo, being doubled on the ropes,
received a few heavy hits on the ribs, but on
Looney striving for his head he got away,
and both went down.</p>

<p>     59.&mdash;&#8203;A close, Looney receiving a shattering
throw.</p>

<p>     60.&mdash;&#8203;Looney had his man on the ropes,
but was too weak to hold him, and received
another burster for his pains.</p>

<p>     61.&mdash;&#8203;Looney, again on the ropes, caught
pepper in the face until it assumed a frightful
appearance, and the claret gushed freely;
he escaped by the cords being pressed down.</p>

<p>     62.&mdash;&#8203;Looney’s right eye was now fast
drawing to a close, but his game was undeniable,
and he still calculated on victory; he
rushed in wildly, caught Bendigo in his arms,
and threw him.</p>

<p>     63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68.&mdash;&#8203;Strange to say
these rounds were in favour of Looney, without
any mischief, in the latter of which
Bendigo was driven against one of the posts
by a hit on the breast, from which he rebounded,
and fell forwards on the turf.</p>

<p>     69.&mdash;&#8203;Looney rushed in, Bendigo caught
his head, drew his cork, and threw him.</p>

<p>     70, 71.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo’s optics all right, and very
cautious. The first a scrambling round,
Looney under. Bendigo, in the next, went
to a close, and was whirled down.</p>

<p>     72.&mdash;&#8203;A little altercation took place in this
round, owing to Bendigo falling on his back
without a blow being struck, which was the
case, but it was not done for the purpose of
evading a blow. Looney was creeping up to
him, and his heel, in retreating, caught a
tuft of grass and threw him, which appeared
to be the general opinion.</p>

<p>     73.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo gave three facers, but was
thrown.</p>

<p>     74.&mdash;&#8203;Looney bored his man to the ropes,
and sent him through them by a muzzler.</p>

<p>     75.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo slipped his left at the all but
closed eye, and went down. (Cries of “Cur.”)</p>

<p>     76.&mdash;&#8203;Looney put in with his right, and
gained the throw.</p>

<p>     77.&mdash;&#8203;Hugging. Looney down.</p>

<p>     78.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo made a hit, and got down by
the ropes.</p>

<p>     79, 80.&mdash;&#8203;Looney received two hits on the
body, and was thrown in each.</p>

<p>     81, 82.&mdash;&#8203;In both of these rounds Looney
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pageno">11</span>
was thrown heavily, but put in a well-meant
hit on the head.</p>

<p>     83.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo, on the ropes, received a heavy
hit on the ribs. Looney was about to repeat
the dose, but was stopped by the cries of
“Foul,” and he left him.</p>

<p>     84.&mdash;&#8203;Another rush. Bendigo whirled down.</p>

<p>     85.&mdash;&#8203;Looney was floored cleverly by a
spanking hit on the chops.</p>

<p>Nothing particular occurred in the next six
rounds; the throws, with the exception of
one, being in favour of Bendigo.</p>

<p>     92.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo showed a good feeling in this
round. In the struggle Looney got seated
on the under rope, but Bendigo would not
take advantage, and walked away.</p>

<p>     93, 94.&mdash;&#8203;Looney down in both these rounds.</p>

<p>     95.&mdash;&#8203;Looney rallied a little, and made two
hits tell with the right on the ear, and Bendigo
went down rather shook.</p>

<p>     96, 97.&mdash;&#8203;Both down together. Bendigo
gave a muzzler in the last, got his man on
the ropes, but was too weak to hold him.</p>

<p>     98.&mdash;&#8203;Looney put in his right on the temple,
but was thrown very heavily.</p>

<p>     99, and last.&mdash;&#8203;Looney came up as blind as
a bat, and rushed in with his right, when
Bendigo mustered up all his remaining
strength and gave him another fall. Molyneux,
finding it useless to prolong the contest,
gave the signal of defeat, after fighting two
hours and twenty-four minutes.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;It will be seen by the above
account that Bendigo won all the three
events&mdash;&#8203;first blood, first knock down, and
the battle. He stands with his right
leg foremost, has a good knowledge of
wrestling, steps nimbly backwards to avoid,
and hits out tremendously with his left. He
was trained under the care of Jem Ward and
Peter Taylor, who must have spared no
pains in tutoring him, being much improved
since he fought Young Langan; and no doubt
will prove a troublesome customer to any
12-stone man who may meet him. He walked
about a quarter of a mile to his carriage. A
tint of black only appeared under his left
eye, but his bodily punishment must be
severe, as he could not bear to be touched on
the left side. He arrived in Manchester the
same evening per gig, and proceeded to
Newton races the following morning. Poor
Looney was terribly punished about the face,
being cut under and over each eye, and his
lips and nose terribly mangled: besides the
loss of a grinder or two, he lost a great
quantity of blood from nose, mouth, and
other gashes in the face. He is possessed of
most unflinching game, but is slow in his
motions; he strikes very heavy with his
right, but it is too long a time in arriving at
its destination. All that could be done for
him by his seconds, Molyneux and Birchall,
was done. The ring was sometimes in great
disorder, owing to want of attention on the
part of the ring-keepers.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Bendigo, on the occasion of a joint benefit with Peter Taylor at the
Queen’s Theatre, Liverpool&mdash;&#8203;which northern city at this period appeared to
have become the metropolis of milling, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice</span> London and Bristol superseded&mdash;&#8203;boldly
claimed the belt. Looney disputed the claim, complaining that
Bendigo had recently refused him another chance, though ready to make a
new match for £50. Tom Britton also demurred to the Championship claim,
and offered to fight Bendy at 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>; money ready to £100 at Mrs.
Ford’s, “Belt Tavern,” Whitechapel, Liverpool.</p>

<p>Fisher, Molyneux (proposing the impossible 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>), and others now
rushed into letter-writing, but Bendy kept up his claim and his price; and
so ran out the year 1837 and part of 1838, the Championship remaining in
abeyance, as Jem Ward had retired, and the Deaf ’un was still in
America.</p>

<p>Bendy’s old opponent and fellow-townsman next re-appeared on the
scene. Ben Caunt, who in the interim had beaten Ben Butler, at Stoney
Stratford, in August, 1837, and Boneford, a big countryman, at Sunrise
Hill, Notts, in October of the same year, proposed to meet “the self-styled
Champion” for £100. Bendigo, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">more suo</span>, thereupon observed, that
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pageno">12</span>
“at that price, or any other, the big, chuckle-headed navvy was as good as
a gift of the money to him.”</p>

<p>All, therefore, went merrily; the instalments were “tabled” as agreed;
Bendy was a good boy, and took care of himself; Big Ben worked hard,
and got himself down to 15<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> (!), as will be seen in our account of
this tourney, which, according to the plan of our work, must appear in the
memoir of the victor, <span class="sc">Ben Caunt</span> (Chapter <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span>), in the present volume.
In this unequal encounter, after seventy-five rounds, Bendigo, who from
a mistake had no spikes in his shoes, had the fight given against him for
going down without a blow. Two to one was laid on Bendigo within
four rounds of the close of the battle.</p>

<p>No slur on the skill, honesty, or bravery of Bendigo was cast by the
umpires and referee in this battle, when they gave their decision that he
had fallen without a blow, and handed over the stakes to Caunt. Bendigo
proposed, before the decision, to make a match for £500, each to raise
£200, to be added to the old battle-money. This Ben declined, but declared
his readiness to enter into new articles for £100. Another match was
accordingly made for £100 a side, to take place on Monday, July 20th,
1838. Bendigo, after bumper benefits in Liverpool, Derby, and Nottingham,
now came to London, with Peter Taylor, and took up his quarters at
Tom Spring’s, where he became an object of much curiosity; his animal
spirits and practical joking being almost too much for Tom Winter’s quiescent
and almost sedate temperament. In London he also took a benefit, “before
going into strict training,” said the bills. There was “somewhat too much
of this,” for Ben also was taking benefits in Notts, Leicester, and Derby.
In the month of June it may be noted Deaf Burke returned from America,
a fact which occasioned a hitch in Bendigo’s arrangements, as we shall
presently see, for on June 24th, 1838, we read in <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>: “The match
between Caunt and Bendigo is off by mutual consent, and Caunt desires us
to state, that he is now open to fight any man in the world, barring neither
country nor colour, for from £50 to £500. What does this mean?” The
following paragraph in the ensuing week’s paper may show what it meant:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<span class="sc">Bendigo and Caunt.</span>&mdash;&#8203;On the authority of a letter signed Caunt, we last week stated
that this match was off by mutual consent; but we have since been informed by our Nottingham
correspondent that such is not the fact, and that Caunt’s deposits are forfeited.
Our correspondent adds that Caunt’s backer tried to get the match off, on the plea that it
was a pity to see so little a man as Bendigo fight a giant like Caunt, who was anxious to enter
the ring with Burke. He was, however, told that the fight must go on, and he promised to
attend, but he neither came nor sent the deposit, but forwarded a letter to London stating
that the match was off by mutual consent. As a proof that Bendigo’s backers intended the
mill to go on, the deposit (£20) was received from Sheffield on the Thursday prior to the
Monday, and on that very day £19 towards the next £20 deposit was raised.”
</p>
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pageno">13</span>

<p>Thus pleasantly released from his engagement with his gigantic competitor,
Bendigo instantly responded to the cartel of Deaf Burke, issued on
his landing from the New World, in which the Deaf ’un defied any man
in the Eastern or Western hemisphere to meet him for £100 to £500, within
the twenty-four feet of ropes. £100 was remitted to Peter Crawley to make
the match; but lo! Burke had gone over to France (Owen Swift, Young
Sam, Jack Adams, <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> were already there) with a “noble Earl,” and at
two several meetings, to which the Deaf ’un was summoned, though
Bendigo’s “ready” was there, there was no cash from across the water,
and Jem Burn announced to Peter Crawley, that he had “a letter” from
Paris that “Mister Burke,” who was on a Continental tour, could not fight
for less than £200. In the midst of the ridicule and censure of this proposal,
so inconsistent with his own published challenge, a gentleman offered
to put down the other hundred himself for Bendigo. Crawley, however,
declined to put down £50 of Bendigo’s money until guaranteed the £100.
Thus the matter fell through. The public feeling in this matter was not
badly expressed in a contemporaneous “squib” entitled:&mdash;</p>

<p>September came, and the Deaf ’un was still studying “Paris graces and
parley-vous,” seconding Owen Swift in his second fight with Jack Adams
at Villiers, on the 5th of September, 1838. The police prosecution by the
French authorities sent home the tourist, but meantime Bendy’s friends
had been offended by some of his eccentric escapades, and had withdrawn
the cash from Peter’s hands. In November Bendigo writes to the editor
of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, that “he was induced to challenge Burke on the promise of
certain friends at Nottingham to stand by him; but they having broken
faith with him, he could not go on. His readiness and disposition to fight
Burke or any other man continue the same, and, whenever friends will come
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pageno">15</span>
forward to back him, he will be found glad of the opportunity to prove that
there is no unmeaning bounce about him, and that he is neither deficient in
courage nor integrity.”</p>

<p>Such an appeal had an immediate response. The match was made at
Sheffield, Burke’s friends proposing to stake £100 to £80, and a lively
interest was soon awakened. On the occasion of the third deposit, on the
27th of November, at Jem Burn’s, in Great Windmill Street, the aristocratic
muster was numerous, and five to four was freely laid on Burke, who was
present, full of quaint fun, for the Deaf ’un, as well as Bendy, was indeed a
“character.” Burke said he had “lowered his price by £50, rather than not
’commodate Mishter Bendys, as he ses his frinds is backards in comin forards.”
The articles specified that the battle should take place within thirty-four
miles of Nottingham, and the day to be the 15th of January, 1839. These
articles were afterwards revised, and the fight postponed to February 12th,
the stakes&mdash;&#8203;£100 Burke to £80 Bendigo. The Deaf ’un went into training
near Brighton, but removed later to Finchley; Bendigo at Crosby, near
Liverpool. Here, on Sunday, January 4th, Bendigo had a narrow escape
of his life, as the following paragraph records:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<span class="sc">Narrow Escape of Bendigo.</span>&mdash;&#8203;During the storm on Sunday night Bendigo who is in
training at Crosby, near Liverpool, narrowly escaped being ‘gathered unto his fathers.’ It
appears that Peter Taylor went to meet Bendigo on Monday morning, but not finding him at
the appointed place, proceeded at once to Crosby, when he discovered that the house in
which he had left his friend on the previous evening was almost in ruins, the roof having
been blown in, and nearly every window broken. Peter’s fears were, however, soon allayed
by ascertaining that Bendigo was at a neighbouring cottage, where he found him between a
pair of blankets, and looking quite chapfallen. Bendigo said that he would sooner face three
Burkes than pass such another night. He went to bed about nine o’clock, but awoke about
eleven, by his bed rocking under him, the wind whistling around him, and the bricks
tumbling down the chimney. Every minute he expected the house to fall in upon him, and at
three o’clock the hurricane increased so much in violence that he got out of bed, put on his
clothes, and made his escape out of the window. He had not left the house ten minutes
before the roof was blown in. A knight of the awl kindly gave him shelter, and he has since
obtained fresh quarters in the same village.”</p>

<p>As the day approached, intense interest prevailed both in London and
Liverpool, to say nothing of Nottingham, Birmingham, Derby, and Manchester,
all of which towns sent their contingents of amateurs. Jem Ward
undertook to give Bendy “the finishing touch,” and reported him “in
prime twig,” while Burke was declared by Tommy Roundhead, his faithful
red-nosed “secretary” and “esquire,” to be “strong as a rhinoceros and
bold as a lion.”</p>

<p>At length the eventful morn of Tuesday, the 12th of February, 1839,
dawned; it was Shrove Tuesday, and the concourse on all the roads to
Ashby-de-la-Zouch, for which the “office” was given, was something more
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pageno">16</span>
marvellous than that which was occasioned by the “gentle passage of
arms” in which Richard Cœur-de-Lion figured, for which see “Ivanhoe.”
But we will leave <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> to tell the further proceedings of the tournament.</p>

<p>According to articles, the men were to meet within 35 miles of Nottingham,
and it was finally agreed that they should meet at the “Red Lion,”
at Appleby, in Warwickshire, on the Monday, to agree upon the battle-field.
A centre of attraction having been thus appointed, the men were
moved from their training quarters, to be near the scene of action. Burke,
attended by Jem Burn, King Dick, Tommy Roundhead (his secretary), and
other friends, took up his position at Atherstone, while Bendy, under
the fostering care of Jem and Nick Ward and Peter Taylor, approached
in an opposite direction. The contest seemed to excite extraordinary
interest, and the bustle of preparation was observable in all directions. In
Atherstone, a most pugnacious town by ancient charter, Burke was hailed
with great favour, as a precursor of the local sports of Tuesday; for, from
time “whereto the memory of man runneth not to the contrary,” on
Shrove Tuesday the inhabitants of the village exercise a sort of prescriptive
right to settle all disputes in fistic or other combat.</p>

<p>It was decided to pitch the ring as near Appleby as possible, and if
practicable to have the men in the ring at ten o’clock. In the interim
all sorts of vehicles were pressed into the service, horses were at a high
premium, and the most ludicrous shifts were made to procure conveyances.
In some instances mourning coaches, and even a hearse, were irreverently
brought into use, while nags of the most unseemly description were drawn
from their privacy and honoured by being hooked as leaders to post-chaises,
or harnessed to any out-of-the-way kind of vehicle that fortune dictated.
Beds and other accommodation were also difficult to procure, and, as in
times of yore, hundreds, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">de necessitate</span>, sat up all night to be up early in
the morning.</p>

<p>Long before dawn on Tuesday multitudes were progressing towards
Appleby, and at nine o’clock the assemblage in front of Burke’s domicile
was immense. The crowd continued to increase steadily until the arrival
of a cavalcade of “swell drags” from the direction of Leicester, which
gave the signal for departure, as in and upon these were the patrician
supporters of the Deaf ’un. On the arrival of these traps the Burke party
instantly prepared for a start. Jem Ward and Bendigo, who were located
about two miles off, were also in readiness, and lost no time in repairing to
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">17</span>
the trysting-place, which, to the dismay of the toddlers and the discomfiture
of the prads, proved to be at least seven miles off. The ring was
formed on the top of a hill, in the parish of Heather, which spot was not
reached by the Deaf ’un, owing to various impediments, until half-past eleven
o’clock. A vast crowd had preceded him, and hailed his approach with
cheers, but it was evident that thousands were yet to arrive, and fortunately
for them an unexpected delay in the arrival of Bendigo proved
favourable to their hopes, by protracting the commencement of hostilities.</p>

<p>It was nearly half-past twelve before the actual arrival of Bendigo was
made known, and at that time, upon a moderate calculation, there were
not less than 15,000 persons present of all degrees, the aristocracy forming
no inconsiderable portion.</p>

<p>From some inexplicable delay it wanted only a quarter to one when
Burke entered the ring, attended by King Dick and Jackson, and if
good humour and confidence could be taken as indications of success his
friends had no reason to grumble. While waiting for the arrival of Bendigo
an incident occurred which produced considerable laughter: it was
the approach of a well-dressed and not unlikely woman, who, forcing her
way through the well-packed mass of spectators, ran up to the roped
arena, and, seizing the Deaf ’un by the hand as an old acquaintance, wished
him success, and, but for the intervening rope, would no doubt have added
an embrace. She then seated herself in front of the inner circle, and
waited the issue of the battle, subsequently cheering her favourite
throughout his exertions. Shortly before one o’clock Bendigo made his
salaam amidst deafening shouts, attended by Peter Taylor and Nick
Ward, and, walking up to Burke, shook him heartily by the hand. The
men then commenced their toilets, and on being stripped to their drawers
a subject of much contention arose; Bendigo, on examining Burke’s
drawers, discovered a belt round his waist, which he insisted should be
taken off. In vain did Burke and his friends assure him it was merely a
belt to sustain a truss which he wore in consequence of a rupture, and,
as it was below his waist, was of no importance; in vain, too, did the
referee pronounce it to be perfectly fair; Bendigo was not to be driven
from his point, and it was not till the obnoxious belt was taken off that he
was satisfied. The belt was exhibited, and fully corroborated the opinion
of the referee as to its perfect inutility as a means of defence.</p>

<p>The signal having been given, the men threw off their great coats, and,
advancing to the scratch, threw themselves into position; and now, for the
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">18</span>
first time, a superficial estimate of their condition could be formed. Burke
presented all that fine muscular development for which he is famed, but he
was pale, and it struck us most forcibly that his flesh wanted that firmness
and consistency, the sure consequence of perfect training, and to the
attainment of which the mode in which he passed his time was anything
but conducive; still he was playful and confident, and regarded his adversary
with a look of conscious superiority. Bendigo, in point of muscularity,
was inferior to Burke, especially in the shoulders, arms, and neck, but he
appeared in perfect condition, and firm as iron. The colour of his skin
was healthful; his countenance exhibited perfect self-possession, and
wore an easy smile of confidence. The current odds, on setting to, were
six to four on Burke, with plenty of takers. In Nottingham, where the
physical qualities of Bendigo were better known, the odds had been as
low as five to four.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;The position of Burke was
easy and unconstrained. He stood rather
square, his left foot in advance, and his arms
well up, as if waiting for his antagonist to
break ground. Bendigo, on the contrary,
dropped his right shoulder, stooped a little,
and, right foot foremost, seemed prepared
to let fly left or right as the opportunity
offered. After a little manœuvring, he
made a catching feint with his left, but
found the Deaf ’un immovably on his guard.
They changed ground, both ready, when
Bendigo let go his right, and caught Burke
on the ribs, leaving a visible impression of
his knuckles. More manœuvring. Bendigo
tried his left, but was stopped. The Deaf
’un popped in his right, and caught Bendigo
on the ear, but soon had a slap in return
from Bendigo’s right, under the eye, as
straight as an arrow. (Cheers for Bendigo.)
Both steady. Bendigo made two or three
feints with his left, but did not draw the
Deaf ’un. Each evidently meaning mischief,
and getting closer together. Counter
hits with the left, when both, by mutual
consent, got to a rally, and severe hits, right
and left, were exchanged. The Deaf ’un
closed, but Bendigo broke away, and turning
round renewed the rally. Heavy exchanges
followed, when they again closed, and trying
for the fall both went down in the corner.
(There was a cry of first blood from Bendigo’s
left ear; but, although very red from the
Deaf ’un’s visitations, the referee, who
examined it, decided there was no claret.)</p>

<p>2.&mdash;&#8203;Both men showed symptoms of the
“ditto repeated” in the last round, although
no great mischief was done, nor was there
much advantage booked, each having given
as good as he got. The Deaf ’un resumed
his defensive position, and was steady.
Bendigo again tried the feint with his left,
evidently desirous of leading off with his
right, but the Deaf ’un was awake to this
dodge, and grinned. The Deaf ’un tried
his right, but was stopped. After a pause,
during which the men shifted their ground,
Bendigo let go his left, but was prettily
stopped. He was more successful with his
right, and caught the Deaf ’un a stinger
under the eye. The straightness and quickness
of these right-hand deliveries were now
conspicuous. Counter hits, left and right,
followed, and the Deaf ’un showed a slight
tinge of claret on the mouth, but it was not
claimed. The Deaf ’un now made up his
mind for a determined rally, and to it they
went ding-dong; the stops, hits, and returns,
right and left, were severe, and no flinching.
Bendigo again wheeled round, but the
Deaf ’un was with him, and the rally was
renewed with equal vigour and good will.
Bendigo, rather wild at the end, closed, and
after a sharp struggle, both down. (The
Deaf ’un’s <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chère amie</span>, before alluded to, now
cheered him, but, indifferent to her blandishments,
he was carried to his corner
piping a little from the severity of his exertion.
Bendigo, on reaching his corner,
seemed freshest, and exhibited less impression
from the blows which he had received
than his antagonist.)</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Both came up strong on their pins,
but the Deaf ’un’s face, especially on the
left cheek, was greatly flushed, and other
marks and tokens of searching deliveries
were visible. The Deaf ’un looked serious,
and coughed as if the contents of his
pudding-bag were not altogether satisfied
with the disturbance to which they had been
exposed. Sparring for a short time, when
Bendigo let go his right, but was stopped;
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">19</span>
it was a heavy hit, and the sound of the
dashing knuckles was distinctly heard.
Well-meant blows on both sides stopped.
The Deaf ’un again coughed; his “cat’s
meat” was clearly out of trim. Again did
the Deaf ’un stop Bendigo’s right, but did
not attempt to return. He now seemed to
gain a little more confidence, and exhibited
a few of his hanky-panky tricks, making
a sort of Merry Andrew dance; but his
jollity was soon stopped, for Bendigo popped
in his left and right heavily, and got away.
The Deaf ’un changed countenance and
was more serious; Bendigo again tried his
left-handed feints and was readiest to fight,
but the Deaf ’un stood quiet. (Even bets
offered on Bendigo.) Bendigo closed in
upon his man, who waited on the defensive;
but his defensive system was
inexplicable, for Bendigo jobbed him four
times in succession with the right under the
left eye, on the old spot, jumping away
each time without an attempt at return on
the part of the Deaf ’un, and producing a
fearful hillock on the Deaf ’un’s cheek-bone.
The Deaf ’un seemed paralysed by the
stinging severity of these repeated visitations
and his friends called on him to go in and
fight. He made an attempt with his right,
but was short; at last he rushed to a rally,
and some heavy hits were exchanged;
Bendigo retreated, but kept hitting on the
retreat. The deliveries were rapid and
numerous, but those of the Deaf ’un did
not tell on the hard frontispiece of his
opponent. They broke away, but again
joined issue, and the rally was renewed.
The jobbing hits, right and left, from
Bendigo were terrific, and the Deaf ’un’s nose
began to weep blood for the state of his left
ogle, which was now fast closing. (The
question of first blood was now decided.)
Bendigo broke away again, the Deaf ’un
following, but Bendigo, collecting himself,
jobbed severely, the Deaf ’un apparently
no return, and almost standing to
receive. He looked round and seemed
almost stupefied, but still he kept his legs,
when Bendigo went in and repeated his
right-handed jobs again and again; he then
closed, gave the Deaf ’un the crook, threw
him, and fell on him. (The seconds immediately
took up their men, and both
showed distress, especially the Deaf ’un,
who was obviously sick, but could not relieve
his stomach, although he tried his
finger for that purpose. All were astonished
at his sluggishness. He seemed completely
bothered, and to have lost all power of
reflection and judgment.)</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf ’un now came up all the
worse from the effects of the last rattling
round, while Bendigo scarcely showed a
scratch. The seconds of the Deaf ’un
called on him “to go in and fight;” he
obeyed the call, but again had Bendigo’s
right on his damaged peeper. Bendigo
fought on the retreat, hitting as he stepped
back, but steadying himself he caught the
Deaf ’un on the nose with his right, and
sent his pimple flying backwards with the
force of the blow. The Deaf ’un rushed in,
hitting left and right, and in getting back
Bendigo fell over the ropes out of the ring.
(The fight had now lasted sixteen minutes;
the Deaf ’un had all the worst of it, although
Bendigo from his exertions exhibited
trifling symptoms of distress.)</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf ’un came up boldly, but all
his cleverness seemed to have left him.
Bendigo, steady, was first to fight, popping
in his right; exchanges followed, and in the
close both went down, Burke uppermost.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;“Drops of brandy” were tried with
the Deaf ’un, but his friends seemed to have
“dropped down on their luck.” Still he
came up courageously, although his right as
well as his left eye was pinked. Counter-hitting,
in which Bendigo’s right was on the
old spot. A close at the ropes, the Deaf
’un trying for the fall, but after some
pulling both went down and no harm done.
(Three to one on Bendigo, but no takers.)</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf ’un’s left eye was now as
dark as Erebus, and as a last resource he
tried the rush; he rattled in to his man
without waiting for the attack, but in the
close, after an exchange of hits and a severe
struggle, was thrown. The moment the
Deaf ’un was picked up he cried “Foul!”
and asserted that Bendigo had butted him,
looking anxiously at the umpire and referee
for a decision in his favour; but there was
no pretence for the charge, as it was obvious
Bendigo merely jerked back his head to relieve
himself from his grasp. Like “a
drowning man,” however, it was obvious he
was anxious to “catch at a straw.”</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf ’un showed woeful punishment
in the physog, although not cut.
Again did he make a despairing rush,
stopping Bendigo’s right, but in the second
attempt he was not so fortunate, for Bendigo
muzzled, closed, and threw him.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf ’un’s game was now clearly
all but up, for while he showed such prominent
proofs of the severity of his antagonist’s
visitations to his nob, the latter was
but little the worse for wear. The Deaf ’un,
however, was determined to cut up well, and
again rattled in left and right, Bendigo retreating
and jobbing as he followed, and at
length hitting him down with a right-handed
blow on the pimple. The Deaf ’un, with
one hand and one knee on the ground, looked
up, but Bendigo stood steadily looking at
him, and would not repeat the blow, showing
perfect coolness and self-possession.</p>

<p>     10, and last.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf ’un, greatly distressed,
still came up with a determination
to produce a change if he could by in-fighting.
He rushed into his man, hitting
left and right, but receiving heavy jobs in
return. He forced Bendigo with his back
against the ropes, and, as he had him in that
position, deliberately butted him twice,
when both went down in the struggle for
the fall. Jem Ward immediately cried
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span>
“Foul!” and appealed to the referee, who
refused to give any decision till properly
appealed to by the umpires. He stepped
into the ring, where he was followed by the
umpires, when he was again appealed to,
and at once declared that Burke had butted,
and that therefore Bendigo was entitled to
the victory&mdash;&#8203;a judgment in which, it is due
to say, the umpire of the Deaf ’un, although
anxious to protect his interests, declared in
the most honourable manner he must concur.
Several of Bendigo’s friends wished no advantage
of this departure from the new
rules to be taken, foreseeing that a few
more rounds must finish the Deaf ’un; but
the decision of the referee was imperative,
and thus ended a contest which disappointed
not only the backers of the Deaf ’un but
the admirers of the Ring generally, who
anticipated on the Deaf ’un’s part a
different issue, or at least a better fight.
With regard to the butting, of which we
have no doubt, our impression is that it was
done intentionally, and for the express
purpose of terminating the fight in that way
rather than by prolonging it to submit to
additional punishment and the mortification
of a more decided defeat; and we are the
more inclined to this conclusion from the
Deaf ’un’s readiness to claim a butt on the
part of Bendigo in the seventh round, a
convincing proof that he was fully sensible
of its nature and consequence. An
attempt was subsequently made to wrangle
with the referee on the soundness of his
decision, for the purpose of sustaining the
character of the Deaf ’un, and exciting a
spirit of discontent among his backers.
This was not creditable, and to be classed
among these petty expedients to which
some of our modern “Ringsters” are but
too willing to have recourse&mdash;&#8203;namely, at all
events “to win, tie, or wrangle,” a practice
to which every honest man must be opposed.
The time occupied in the contest was exactly
four-and-twenty minutes. In no one
of Burke’s former battles was he more
severely punished in the face, not, it is true,
in any vital part, for all Bendigo’s hits,
both left and right, were as straight as a line,
going straight from the shoulder and slap to
their destination. There were no round
hits on his part, and the body blows on
both sides were few and far between.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Perhaps no battle on record
offers a stronger illustration of the consequences
of vanity and headstrong confidence
than that which we have just recorded.
Burke, puffed up by his former successes,
and flattered by the good-natured freedom
of young men of fashion, placed himself beyond
the pale of instruction and advice.
He was self-willed and obstinate, and
quarrelled with all who presumed to guide
him in the proper course. His repeated
acts of imprudence while in training called
forth the strongest remonstrances, but in
vain; and thus he has found, when too
late, that “a man who will be his own adviser”
on such occasions “has a fool for his
client.” Nothing but the most decided want
of condition can account for the slowness
which he exhibited; and, when his career
from the time he went to Brighton till the
day of the battle is considered, that state of
constitution is sufficiently explained; and
yet those besotted friends who knew all this
were as prejudiced in his favour that they
blindly pinned their faith to his former reputation,
believed no man alive could beat
him, and risked their money, as well as
stultified their judgment, on we issue of his
exertions. But then say these wiseacres,
opening their eyes with well-feigned astonishment,
“We could not have erred. It is
impossible, seeing all that we have seen, and
knowing what we have known of the Deaf
’un that he could have made so bad a fight,
and be beaten so hollow by a countryman!”
Oh no! this could not be&mdash;&#8203;and what follows?
Why, the old story&mdash;&#8203;the honest Deaf ’un has
all at once turned rogue&mdash;&#8203;he had been bought
and fought a cross!&mdash;&#8203;he has sold his friends,
and must be consigned to degradation. Why,
from the third round it was seen by the merest
tyro in the ring that he had not a chance.
He was completely paralysed by the unexpected
quickness of his adversary, who has,
as Jem Ward foretold, proved himself a
better man than has for some years appeared
in the ring. This has been Ward’s constant
cry, and had his advice been taken all the
odds that were offered would have been
taken. But no; the Londoners were not to
be beaten out of their “propriety.” Twos to
one, sevens to four, and sixes to four have,
as is well known, been offered over and over
again in sporting houses without takers,
and many who lamented the impossibility
of “getting on” before the fight,
have now, after it, the consolation of feeling
that they have “got off” most miraculously.
And yet this was a cross; and the cunning
concoctors of the robbery had the generosity
to refuse the hundreds which were, as it were,
forced under their noses. Verily this is
“going the whole hog” with a vengeance;
but from the little we know of such speculations
we are inclined to think that those
who hazard such an opinion will be deemed
greater flats than they have proved themselves.
It is an accusation unjust towards
a weak, but, we believe, an honest man,
and still more unjust towards Bendigo, who,
throughout, proved himself, in every respect,
a better fighter, as well as a harder hitter,
than Burke, and who, in no part of the
battle, was guilty of an act which would disentitle
him to the honour and profit of his
victory. But some facts seem to be altogether
lost sight of in forming a just estimate of
poor Burke’s pretensions, for, independent of
his want of condition, it seems to be forgotten
that instead of fighting or sparring for
the last two years he has been confining
himself to the personification of “the
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pageno">21</span>
Grecian statues,” forsooth&mdash;&#8203;anything but
calculated to give energy to his limbs&mdash;&#8203;added
to which he is ruptured. We are also informed
on medical authority that the patella
or knee-pan of his right leg is as weak from
the fracture which he sustained in the hospital
some time back that he is obliged to
support it by double laced bandages, and he
has been altogether precluded from taking
strong walking or running exercise, never
having walked more than ten miles in any
one day of his training. For our own part
we think his day is gone by, and, like many
other great performers, he has appeared
once too often; but that he intentionally
deceived his friends we believe to be a most
ungenerous calumny, although his friends
may have deceived themselves. After the
fight, Burke, who was sufficiently well to
walk from the ring, returned to Appleby,
and from there to “foot-ball kicking” Atherstone,
where the annual sports were merrily
kept up in his absence. The same night he
returned to Coventry, and arrived by the
mail train in London the next morning, none
the worse in his bodily health from the peppering
he received, however mentally he was
“down on his luck.” He complained much
of his arms, which, from the wrists to the
elbows, were covered with bruises, the effects
of stopping&mdash;&#8203;and stopping blows, too, which,
had they reached their destination, would
have expedited his downfall. Bendigo returned
to Nottingham the same night, decorated
with his well-earned laurels; and it
is to be hoped he will enjoy his victory with
becoming modesty and civility, bearing in
mind that he has yet to conquer Caunt before
he can be proclaimed Champion of
England.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>The Deaf ’un, who showed on the Friday at Jem Burn’s, with the
exception of his “nob” was all right. He complains most of having been
stripped of his belt, which was attached to his truss by a loop, and the
absence of which filled him with apprehension. This, combined with his
admitted want of condition, he declares placed him on the wrong side the
winning post. He is, however, most anxious for another trial, and
instructs us to say that he still has supporters who will match him once
more against Bendigo for £100 a side, the fight to come off in the same
ring with Hannan and Walker; Burke to be permitted to wear his belt, as
in the case of Peter Crawley and Jack Langan. It is needless to say that
Burke never again faced Bendigo in the ring, getting on a match at this time
with Jem Bailey.</p>

<p>For several months the newspapers were rife with challenges from Caunt
to Bendigo and Bendigo to Caunt; each “Champion” roving about the
counties in which he was most popular upon the “benefit dodge,” each with
a star company, and each awakening the city or town where his company
performed with a thundering challenge, while each pugilistic planet revolved
in his own peculiar orbit without giving the other a chance of a “collision.”</p>

<p>In this interval Jem Ward presented a “Champion’s” belt to Bendigo,
at the Queen’s Theatre, Liverpool, amid great acclamations, and again the
tiresome game of challenging and making appointments for “a meeting to
draw up articles,” at places where the challenged party never attended
or meant to show, went on. Brassey, of Bradford, too, having in the interim
beaten Young Langan, of Liverpool, and Jem Bailey, put in his claim and
joined the chorus of challengers. Burke also offered himself for £100,
which Bendigo declined, according to his published challenge. In the
latter half of 1839 we read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;&#8203;Caunt states that he has been given to understand I wish to have another trial
with him for £200 a side, and that his money is ready at any sporting house in Sheffield.
Now, Sir, I have been to many houses that he frequents, and cannot find any one to put
any money down in his behalf; and as he was in Sheffield for a fortnight previous to my
going away to second Renwick, I think, if he meant fighting, he would have made the match
when we were both in Sheffield. Now, Sir, what I mean to say is this&mdash;&#8203;I will fight Caunt,
or any other man in England, for from £200 to £500 a side, and I hope I shall not be
disappointed, as I mean fighting, and nothing else; and to convince the patrons of the
Prize Ring that there is no empty chaff about me, as I am going to leave Sheffield this
week, my money will be ready any day or hour at Mr. Edward Daniels’, ‘Three Crowns,’
Parliament Street, Nottingham. Or if Burke wants another shy, I will fight him for
£150 a side.</p>

<p>This certainly looked like business, yet the next week we find Caunt
declaring “I will make a match with Bendigo for £200, and I will take a
sovereign to go to Nottingham, or give Bendigo the same if he will meet
me at Lazarus’s house at Sheffield.” This was in July, and shortly after
Bendigo writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">

<p>     “<span class="sc">Mr. Editor</span>,&mdash;&#8203;Having sent a letter to Caunt accepting his challenge on his own terms,
and not receiving an answer, I wish to put that bounceable gentleman’s intentions to a
public test. I am willing to fight him on his own terms, and I will give him the sovereign
he requires to pay his expenses in coming to Nottingham to make the match, and let it be
as early as possible. As to Deaf Burke, he is but of minor importance to me. I have no
objection to give him another chance to regain his lost laurels, and will fight him for his
‘cool hundred,’ as he calls it, providing he or his friends make the first deposit £50, for
my friends are not willing to stake less. Should the above not suit either of these aspirants
for fistic fame, I again repeat I will fight any man in the world for £200 or £500, barring
neither weight, country, nor colour. I am always to be heard of at the ‘Three Crowns,’

<p>Soon after we read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p>“<span class="sc">Caunt and Bendigo.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo went to Nottingham to make the match with Caunt
on Saturday week, but the latter could not find more than two sovereigns to put down as a
deposit. Caunt, before he indulges in bounce, should reflect that he only disgraces himself
and gains nothing by his ‘clap-traps.’ These benefit humbugs must be suppressed.”</p>
</div><!--end letter-->

<p>No wonder that the much-enduring editor should thus express himself.
Nevertheless the “benefit humbug,” like other humbugs, exhibited irrepressible
vitality; 1840 wore on, and Caunt, who seemed to prefer a
tourney with Brassey or Nick Ward (who had challenged him), did not close
with Bendigo. Had there been a real intention, the subjoined should have
brought the men together:&mdash;</p>

<p>     “<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;&#8203;I agree with you that there is more ‘talk than doing’ among the professors of

fame and character which they do not always possess&mdash;&#8203;I allude particularly to Caunt
and Bendigo, ‘the Great Guns of the day.’ Each talks of being backed, but each, in turn,
avoids ‘the scratch.’ Now to the test: I am anxious, for the sake of society, that ‘old
English Boxing’ should not decline, because I am sure it is the best school for the inculcation
of ‘fair play,’ and the suppression of the horrible modern use of the knife&mdash;&#8203;and of
this I am prepared to give proof. Bendigo says he will not fight Caunt for less than £200,
which sum I presume he can find, or he, too, is carrying on ‘the game of humbug.’ Caunt
says he is equally ready to fight Bendigo, but cannot come to his terms. Now to make
short work of it&mdash;&#8203;if Caunt can get backed for £100, I will find another £100 for him, and
thus come to Bendigo’s terms. Let him communicate with Jem Burn, in whom I have confidence,
and the money shall be ready at a moment’s warning. I wish for a fair, manly fight
and no trickery; and my greatest pleasure will be to see the ‘best man win.’ In and out
of the Ring prize-fighters ought to be friends&mdash;&#8203;it is merely a struggle for supremacy, and
this can be decided without personal animosity, foul play, or foul language, all of which
most be disgusting to those who look to sustain a great national and, as I think, an honourable
game.</p>

<p>Brassey, however, was withdrawn from the controversy by an accident
beyond his own control. The magistrates of Salford, determining to
suppress pugilism so far as in them lay, indicted Brassey for riot in seconding
Sam Pixton in a fight with Jones, of Manchester, and, obtaining a
conviction, sentenced him to two months’ incarceration in the borough gaol.
He was thus placed <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</span>.</p>

<p>Early in 1840 Bendigo was in London, with his head-quarters at Burn’s,
where Nick Ward exhibited with him with the gloves in friendly emulation.
The brother of the ex-champion, however, was averse to any closer engagement.
Bendigo returned to the provinces, and the next week the
public was informed that “Caunt’s money, to be made into a stake of £200,
was lying at Tom Spring’s, but nothing has been heard from Bendigo!”
The conjunction of circumstances is curious, for in the same week the subjoined
paragraph appeared, which records an accident which certainly
crippled Bendigo for the rest of his life. Indeed the author, who at this
period saw him occasionally, did not consider him well enough to contend
in the ring up to the time of his crowning struggle with the gigantic Caunt.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p>“<span class="sc">Accident to Bendigo.</span>&mdash;&#8203;William Thompson, better known by his cognomen of
‘Bendigo,’ has met with an accident which is likely to cripple him for life. On Monday he
had been to see the military officers’ steeplechase, near Nottingham, and on his return home
he and his companions were cracking their jokes about having a steeplechase among themselves.
Having duly arrived nearly opposite the Pindar’s House, on the London Road,
about a mile from Nottingham, Bendigo exclaimed, ‘Now, my boys, I’ll show you how to
run a steeplechase in a new style, without falling,’ and immediately threw a somersault; he
felt, whilst throwing it, that he had hurt his knee, and on alighting be attempted in vain
three times to rise from the ground; his companions, thinking for the moment he was joking,
laughed heartily, but discovering it was no joke went to his assistance and raised him up,
but the poor fellow had no use of his left leg. A gig was sent for immediately, in which
he was conveyed to the house of his brother, and Messrs. Wright and Thompson, surgeons,
were immediately called in. On examination of the knee we understand they pronounced
the injury to the cap to be of so serious a nature that he is likely to be lame for life.</p>

<p>This serious mishap, which befell him on the 23rd of March, 1840, was

the result of those “larking” propensities for which Bendy was notorious.

<p>In 1842 Bendigo, maugre the advice of the medicos, made his way to
London, and, putting in an appearance at a “soirée” at Jem Burn’s,
solicited the honour of a glove-bout with Peter Crawley. Bendy’s resuscitation
was hailed with delight, and as he declared his readiness to renew a
broken-off match with Tass Parker, a spirited patron of the Ring declared
that money should be no obstacle. On the Thursday week ensuing, Tass
also being in town with his friends for the Derby week, all parties met at
Johnny Broome’s, and articles were penned and duly signed. By these it
was agreed that the men should meet on Wednesday, the 24th of August,
within twenty miles of Wolverton, in the direction of Nottingham, for a
stake of £200 a side.</p>

<p>Parker having beaten Harry Preston, the game Tom Britton, of Liverpool,
and the powerful John Leechman (Brassey, of Bradford), was now at
the pinnacle of his fame. His friends, too, were most confident, as
Bendigo’s lameness was but too painfully apparent. Tass offered to
“deposit the value of Bendigo’s belt, to be the prize of the victor.” The
match went on until June 28th, when, £140 being down, it was announced
at the fifth deposit that the bold Bendigo was in custody on a warrant
issued by his brother (a respectable tradesman in Nottingham), who was
averse to his milling pursuits. The rumour was too true. Bendy was
brought before their worships, charged with intending a breach of the peace
with one Hazard Parker, and held to bail to keep the peace towards all Her
Majesty’s subjects for twelve months, himself in £100, and two sureties of
£100 each.</p>

<p>During this interval, too, Ben Caunt had not been idle. He had beaten
Brassey on the 27th of October, 1840, after a long, clumsy tussle of 101
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span>
rounds in an hour and a half, as may be read in the memoir of <span class="sc">Caunt</span>. He
had also lost a fight with Nick Ward, by being provoked to a foul blow,
and then beaten the same shifty pug. in May, 1841, thereafter departing on
a tour to America, after the fashion of other modern champions. “Time
and the hour wore on;” Bendy’s knee strengthened, and Big Ben returned
from Yankeeshire, bringing with him, from the land of “big things,” the
biggest so-called boxer that ever sported buff in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, in the person of
Charles Freeman, weighing 18<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, and standing 6<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> 10½<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> in his stocking
feet. Freeman’s brief career will be found in an Appendix to that of his
only antagonist <span class="sc">William Perry</span>, the Tipton Slasher.</p>

<p>At the close of 1843 Bendigo once again disputed the now established
claim of Caunt to the proud title of Champion of England, when Brassey
also offered himself to Bendigo’s notice. The Bradford Champion, however,
does not seem to have had moneyed backers, and the business hung fire.
On the 14th February, 1844, we find the following:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="i0">Many happy returns of the Spring, bouncing Brassey,</div>
   <div class="i2">I hope Fortune gives you no cause to complain,</div>
   <div class="i0">That you’re right as a trivet, determined and saucy,</div>
   <div class="i2">And ready for mischief with Bendy again.</div>
  </div><div class="stanza">
   <div class="i0">May I never again take a sip of blue ruin</div>
   <div class="i2">If I love to see fair English fighting take wing;</div>
   <div class="i0a">’Tis time for the “big ’uns” to up and be doing,</div>
   <div class="i2">For bantam cocks only show now in the Ring.</div>
  </div><div class="stanza">
   <div class="i0">Then again for the laurel crown let us be tugging,</div>
   <div class="i2">May fair play be always our motto and plan!</div>
   <div class="i0">But Caunt I denounce, and his system of hugging,</div>
   <div class="i2">A practice more fit for a bear than a man.</div>
  </div><div class="stanza">
   <div class="i0">As to Freeman, the giant&mdash;&#8203;I don’t mean offending&mdash;</div>
   <div class="i2">His bulk and his weight may astonish the raw,</div>
   <div class="i0">But when with Bill Perry, the Slasher, contending,</div>
   <div class="i2">I’m bless’d if he showed any point worth a straw.</div>
  </div><div class="stanza">
   <div class="i0">Of falsehood I scorn the unclean manufacture,</div>
   <div class="i2">My luck with good men always forward to try;</div>

   <div class="i2">With the Yankee I wouldn’t have shrunk from a shy.</div>
  </div><div class="stanza">
   <div class="i0">Then, Brassey, come out if you truly mean milling,</div>
   <div class="i2">And drop down your dust for a match if you dare,</div>

   <div class="i2">To give you a sample of Nottingham ware.</div>
  </div><div class="stanza">
   <div class="i0">I’m anxious, bold Brassey, again to be busy,</div>

   <div class="i2">To see two game pugilists stripp’d to the buff.</div>
  </div><div class="stanza">
   <div class="i0">But here I conclude, for my time’s up for starting,</div>
   <div class="i2">And conscience is giving a sort of a shove;</div>

<p>Brassey did not make a deposit, and Caunt, who was now settled at the
“Coach and Horses,” <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s Lane, seemed rather given to benefits
and bounce than boxing.</p>

<p>The rest of the year was consumed in correspondence, in which Bendigo
demanded the odds offered and then retracted by Caunt, the latter having,
<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad interim</span>, a row, and ridiculous challenge from Jem Burn, and an
equally absurd cartel from a burly publican named Kingston, whose
eccentric antics will be noticed in the memoir of <span class="sc">Caunt</span>.</p>

<p>The year 1845 was, however, destined to see the eccentric Bendigo and
the ponderous Caunt brought together. All doubts and surmises were
silenced when articles were signed to the effect that on the 9th of September,
1845, the men were to meet, Bendigo having closed, after innumerable
difficulties, with Caunt’s terms of £200 a side and the belt.</p>

<p>At the final deposit, on August 26th, at Tom Spring’s, the Castle Tavern,
Holborn, it was officially announced that both men were in splendid condition.
Bendigo had trained at Crosby, near Liverpool, under the care of
Jem Ward, and Caunt near Hatfield, in Hertfordshire, where he was
looked after by his uncle, Ben Butler, and by Jem Turner, the D’Orsay of
the Ring, besides being constantly visited by his great friend and patron, the
gallant Tom Spring. Caunt, who was now thirty-three years of age, had
scaled over 17<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> when he went into training, but on the day of the fight was
reduced to a pound under 14<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, the lightest weight he ever reached in any
of his fights. Bendigo, who was three years older, weighed 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 1<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, and
was also in the pink of condition. When articles were originally signed, on
April 17th, it was arranged that the fight should take place half-way
between London and Nottingham, but at the final supper this was altered
by mutual consent to Newport Pagnel, in Bucks. On the Sunday Bendigo,
Merryman, and Jem Ward arrived at Newport Pagnel, which led to an
immediate issue of a warrant, and Bendigo’s friends took him out of the
town to a neighbouring farmhouse. Caunt turned up in London, at
Spring’s, with his uncle, Ben Butler, on the Monday afternoon, in high
spirits, though remarkably thin. He had got rid of every ounce of
superfluous flesh, and was nothing but bone and sinew. Two hundred of
his handkerchiefs were sold, at a guinea each if he won, nothing if he lost.
He left by the four o’clock train for Wolverton, from whence he proceeded,
with Spring and other friends, to the “Cock” at Stony Stratford. Newport
Pagnel was full of the Nottingham division. The “Swan” (Tom
Westley’s) and all the other inns were filled to excess. In the evening Spring
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pageno">28</span>
went to the “Swan” to meet Bendigo’s friends to settle the place.
Bendigo wished to fight in Bucks; Spring had seen constables with
warrants, and wanted to take them to Oxfordshire, to Lillingston Level,
where Deaf Burke and Nick Ward fought in 1840. There was a long
disputation, but at last they agreed to toss. Jem Ward, for Bendigo, won,
and they chose Bedfordshire. In the morning they again altered their
minds, and determined to try Whaddon in Oxfordshire. This ill-judged proceeding
necessitated a ten miles’ tramp to Whaddon, where the first ring
was pitched. Meanwhile, at the “Cock,” at Stony Stratford, the chief
constable told Spring that Whaddon was in Bucks, and that they could not
fight in that county. Spring sent off a messenger, but at first the Nottingham
roughs would not allow a move to be made; at last they started for another
eight miles’ walk to Sutfield Green. At half-past two a second ring was
formed, when there were at least 10,000 people present. The Nottingham
roughs, who were in great force, made an invasion, and drove all back who
would not buy Nottingham tickets. Spring, who had provided tickets for
the London men, had not yet arrived. At twenty minutes past three the
men entered the ring&mdash;&#8203;Caunt first, attended by Molyneux the Black and
Jem Turner as seconds, Butler having charge of the bottles. Bendigo was
attended by Nick Ward and Jack Hannan, Jem Ward and Jem Burn.
They shook hands, and tossed for choice of corners. Caunt won, and took
the higher ground, with his back to the sun. Spring, in compliance with
the articles, produced Caunt’s belt, and handed it to Bendigo to show it was
the genuine article. He buckled it on in bravado, and laughingly offered
to bet Caunt £50 that he would win the fight. Caunt declined; he evidently
did not appreciate Bendy’s funniment. The belt was then handed to Jem
Ward to await the result. There was another disputation about choice of
referee. After various names had been proposed on one side only to be
captiously rejected on the other, “t’Auld Squire”&mdash;&#8203;the renowned George
Osbaldiston&mdash;&#8203;who had retreated to his carriage to get out of the rush, was
agreed to. At first the Squire declined, but being pressed, and it being
urged that if he did not consent the match would not come off, he accepted.
Bendigo’s colours were blue with white spot&mdash;&#8203;Caunt’s bright orange, with
blue border, the following inscription in a garter in centre:&mdash;&#8203;“Caunt
and Bendigo, for £200 and the Championship of England, 9th September,
1845.” This was surrounded with the words, “May the best man win!”</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt threw himself into attitude
erect and smiling, whilst Bendigo at
once began to play round him, dodging and
shifting ground in his usual style. Caunt
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pageno">29</span>
let fly his left, but missed. Bendigo, active
on his pins, retreated, and <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasséed</span> left and
right; at last he crept in closer, then out
again, till, watching his opportunity, he got
closer, and popped in a sounding smack with
his left on Caunt’s right eye. After a few
lively capers he succeeded in delivering
another crack with his left on Caunt’s cheek,
opening the old scar left by Brassey, and
drawing first blood, as well as producing an
electric effect on Caunt’s optic. (Shouts unlimited
from Bendigo’s friends.) Bendy got
away laughing, and again played round his
man. Caunt got closer, missed an intended
slasher with his left, and closed for the fall.
Bendy grappled with him, but could not
escape, and Caunt, by superior strength,
forced him down at the corner.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt up at the call of time, his cheek
and eye testifying the effects of the visitations
in the last round, Bendy dancing round
him, and waiting for an opening. Slight exchanges
left and right, Caunt missing his
opponent’s head; Bendigo, in retreating to
the ropes, slipped down, was up again in a
moment, and dashed to his man. Wild exchanges,
but no apparent execution; Caunt
hit out viciously left and right, missed his
kind intentions, and Bendy got down unscathed.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt came up quiet, and determined
on annihilation. Bendy again played about
him, but did not get near enough for execution.
After some wild passes, Caunt
missing, Bendigo, on the retreat, was caught
in the powerful grasp of Caunt, who threw
him across the ropes and fell on him, but no
mischief done. (Shouts from the roughs.)</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt came up blowing, when Bendigo,
after a little dodging, popped in his left
under his guard, and got away. Caunt,
determined on mischief, followed his man,
and at last getting to him let fly left and
right, catching Bendy with the left on the
mouth slightly, but missing his right. Bendigo
finding himself in difficulties got down,
falling on the ropes, and grinning facetiously
at Goliath the Second, who walked back to
his corner.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt, first to lead off, drew on his
man, but Bendy retreated, Caunt after him,
till he reached the ropes, when Caunt hit
out left and right, his blows passing harmlessly
over Bendigo’s head. There was a
want of precision in Caunt’s hitting not to
be accounted for with his supposed science.
Bendigo, who stopped rather wildly, got
down.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt, first to the call of time, waited
with his hands well up, but blowing. We
believe he was over-trained, and really distressed
thus early in the struggle. Bendy
manœuvred to the right and left; Caunt
approached him, but he retreated. Caunt
let fly left and right, but Bendy ducked his
canister, and got down with more caution
than gallantry.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Left-handed exchanges on the nobs,
but of no moment. Caunt made some desperate
lunges left and right, but was too
high, and Bendy slipped down.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy, after a few dodges, got within
Caunt’s guard with his left, and gave him a
pretty prop on the cheek. Caunt missed his
return, but, seizing Bendy in his grasp, flung
him over the ropes. Here he leaned heavily
on him, overbalanced himself, and fell over
on his own head, bringing Bendy with him,
amidst loud shouts and abusive epithets.
Caunt fell at the feet of his friends, Tom
Spring and the editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, the
latter of whom was seated on that side of
the ring near the centre stake.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy came up full of glee, and played
round his man, watching for his opportunity
to plant his left. This at last offered, and
catching Caunt on the old wound he ducked
his head to avoid the return, and got down.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;More sly manœuvring by Bendy, who,
after dancing about at arm’s length, stole a
march, and caught Caunt a stinging smack
with his left on the right cheek, drawing
more claret, and giving the big ’un more of
the tragedy hue. Caunt instantly closed,
gave Bendy the Cornish hug, flung him by
main strength, and fell on him.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy pursued his eccentric gyrations
round his man, when with the swiftness of
lightning he popped in his left on the jaw and
right on the body, and fell. Caunt, stung by
these visitations, followed him, and dropped
on his knees close to his man, but luckily did
not touch him, and Bendy was picked up
laughing and uninjured; in fact, up to this
time he scarce showed the semblance of a hit
beyond a slight contusion on the lip and left
ear.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo retreated from Caunt’s
vigorous charge right and left, and slipped
down, but instantly jumped up and renewed
the round. After some wild fighting, but no
execution worth recording, Bendy went down
in his corner, amidst cries of “Foul!” “Unmanly,”
&amp;c.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt, on coming to the scratch, let
fly with his left, just grazing the top of Bendigo’s
scalp. A sharp rally followed, and
counter hits with the left were exchanged,
Bendy hitting Caunt with such terrible force
on the old spot on the right cheek that he
knocked him clean off his legs, thus gaining
the first knock-down blow, amidst deafening
shouts from the Nottingham roughs. Bendigo’s
blow was so powerful that he actually
rebounded back against the stakes, and
Caunt was picked up almost stunned by the
severity of the visitation.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy, elated with his handiwork in
the last round, again dashed in with his left,
but not being sufficiently quick in his retreat
Caunt caught him round the neck with his
left and lifted him to the ropes, and there
hung on him till, in trying to escape from
his grasp, he pulled him forward, threw, and
fell heavily on him, amidst the indignant
shouts of his opponents.
</p>
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pageno">30</span>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy came up as lively as a kitten,
while Caunt, undismayed, came smiling to
the scratch. Caunt plunged in his left and
right, but missed; he then seized his man
for the throw, but Bendy slipped round, and
seizing Caunt by the neck pulled him down.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy tried his left-hand dodge, but
missed and retreated. Caunt followed him
up to his corner, hitting out right and left,
but throwing his hands too high. Caunt
grappled for the fall, but Bendy got down,
Caunt following suit, and as he sat upon the
ground beckoned Bendy to come to him.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy made himself up for mischief,
and played round his man for a few seconds,
when, getting within distance, he delivered
a terrific hit with his left on Caunt’s mouth,
and fell. Caunt’s upper lip was completely
split by this blow, and the blood flowed from
the wound in torrents. (Renewed cheers
from the Nottingham division.)</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy again came the artful dodge
put in his left on Caunt’s mouth, and fell.
Caunt pointed at him, but Bendy laughed
and nodded.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy, more cautious, kept out
Caunt rushed to him, hitting out left and
right, but with little effect. Bendy retreated.
Caunt caught him on the ropes,
and hung on him till he fell. (More shouting
and some threats at Caunt.)</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt, anxious to be at work, advanced,
while Bendy retreated to the ropes,
where he hit up with his left, and slipped.
Caunt turned his back, and was retiring,
when Bendy jumped up, and had another
slap at him. Caunt turned round and caught
him under his arm as he attempted to escape,
lifted him to the ropes, and there held him
till he fell, amidst the cries of Bendy’s
friends.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt prompt to the call of time,
his hands well up, but Bendy again stole a
march, popped in his left, and slipped down
to avoid a return of the compliment. (Indignant
expressions at Bendigo’s shifty way of
terminating the rounds.)</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy was still free from punishment,
and looked as fresh as when he entered
the ring, while Caunt, although firm and
active on his pins, showed heavy marks of
punishment on his frontispiece; his cheek
had a gaping wound, his lip cut, and eye and
nose evincing the consequence of Bendy’s sly
but stinging visitations. Caunt, impatient
at Bendy’s out-fighting, rushed to him left
and right, but Bendy, unwilling to try the
weight of superior metal, slipped down, and
Caunt fell over him, but not on him, as his
friends anticipated, and as perhaps he intended.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Both fresh. After a little dodging,
advancing, and retreating, Bendy again
nailed Caunt with his left on his damaged
kissing-trap. Caunt caught him a slight
nobber on the head with his left, and Bendy
got down.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy again played round his man
till within distance, when he popped in a
heavy blow on the ribs with his left, and got
down without a return. There was an immediate
cry of “Foul!” and an appeal was
made to the referee. He hesitated, amidst
tumultuous cries of “Fair! fair!” and allusions
to the size of Caunt. The uproar was
terrific, and the inner circle was overwhelmed
by the roughs from without rushing in to enforce
their arguments in favour of Bendy.
At last the referee decided “Fair,” and
“time” was called.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Nick Ward was here so overcome
with his exertions that he was taken out of
the ring, and his office was filled by Nobby
Clark. The moment time was called, and
Bendy reached the scratch, Caunt rushed to
him left and right, and after slight and wild
exchanges with the left Bendy slipped and
got down cunning.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy, after a little hanky-panky
manœuvring, popped in his left on Caunt’s
mug, and retreated to the corner of the ring.
Caunt followed him with so much impetuosity
that he hit his hand against the stake. In
the close and scramble for the fall, Bendy
succeeded in pulling Caunt down, falling
with him.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt on his guard, his hands well
up. Bendy stepped in, delivered his left on
the old spot, and dropped to avoid; Caunt
shaking his finger at him as he retired to his
corner. Caunt’s right was visibly puffed by
its contact with the stake in the previous
round.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt attempted to lead off with his
left, but Bendy retreated to the ropes, over
which Caunt forced him, and as he lay upon
him, both still hanging on the lower rope,
Bendy hit up with his left. In this position
they lay, half in and half out of the ring, till
released by their seconds.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt let fly left and right, but he
was short, Bendy playing the shifty game.
Wild fighting on both sides, till Caunt fell on
his knees. Bendy looked at him, lifted his
hand to strike, but he prudently withheld
the blow, and walked to his corner. (Shouts
from the Nottingham “Lambs.”)</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;A rally, in which both fought wildly,
Caunt catching Bendy a crack over the right
brow, from which the claret flowed, and
Bendy returning the compliment on Caunt’s
smeller. In the end Bendy slipped down,
and, on rising, a small black patch was placed
on the damaged thatch of his peeper.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy resumed his hitting and getting
down system, popping in his left on Caunt’s
muzzle, and slipping down.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;The same game repeated. Spring,
indignant, appealed to the referee; and
Molyneux, in like manner, called on the
umpires for their decision; they disagreed,
and Molyneux ran to the referee. The
roughs again had their say. A blow was
aimed at Spring’s head with a bludgeon,
which fortunately only fell on his shoulder.
It was a spiteful rap, and he felt the effect
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
of it for some days. The referee declared,
however, that he had not seen anything unfair,
and Molyneux returned to his man,
and brought him to the scratch at the call of
time, amidst tremendous confusion, sticks in
operation in all directions, and many expressing
great dissatisfaction at Bendy’s unfair
mode of fighting, and the reluctance of the
referee to decide against him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span>
</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;A short round, in which Bendy retreated,
and Caunt, following, caught him
at the ropes and threw him over, falling on
him.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy again popped in his left, and
threw himself down (?) This was repeated
in the two succeeding rounds, but Bendy’s
friends attributed it to accident, and not design,
and there was no adverse decision on
the part of the referee, whose position,
amidst the tumult that prevailed, was far
from enviable. He must have been possessed
of no small nerve to have presumed to
decide against the arguments that were so
significantly shaken in the vicinity of his
knowledge-box, and to this must be attributed
his reluctance to give a candid opinion.
[Partisan writing.&mdash;&#8203;<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor">Ed.</abbr></span> “Pugilistica.”]</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy tried his hit and get-down
practice, but Caunt seized him round the
neck, threw, and fell over him.</p>

<p>     38.&mdash;&#8203;A wild and scrambling rally, in which
Bendigo caught it on the nob. After a
scramble they fell, Caunt within and Bendigo
without the ropes, when each put his tongue
out at the other like angry boys.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;A slight exchange of hits with the
left, when Bendy went down laughing.</p>

<p>     40.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy popped in his left on Caunt’s
ancient wound, his right on the ribs, and
slipped down.</p>

<p>     41.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy renewed his left-handed visitation,
and was retreating, when Caunt
rushed after him, caught him at the ropes,
over which he threw him, and fell on him.
A blow was here aimed at Caunt’s head by
one of the roughs with a bludgeon, but it fell
on Bendy’s shoulder.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span>
</p>

<p>     42.&mdash;&#8203;Exchanges of hits left and right, when
Bendy got down.</p>

<p>     43.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy manœuvred in his old way,
delived a smashing hit with his left on
Caunt’s throat, and went down to avoid a
return.</p>

<p>     44.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt came up fresh, and rushed to
the assault, but Bendy got down. Caunt,
indignant, jumped over him, but luckily fell
on his knees beyond him, without touching
him. It was assumed that he meant to jump
on him, and an uproarious appeal of “Foul”
was made to the referee, which, after much
confusion, he decided in the negative, and
ordered the men to go on.</p>

<p>     45.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy renewed his Merry Andrew
curvetings, and tried his left, but Caunt
seized him round the neck with his right,
and swung him twice round like a cat.
Bendy succeeded in getting the lock with his
right leg, when Caunt gave him a twist,
threw, and fell heavily on him, a little to
the derangement of the Nottingham heroes,
who shouted vociferously.</p>

<p>     46.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt again succeeded in catching
Bendy by the neck under his powerful arm,
threw, and fell heavily on him, but at the
same time came with great force against the
ground himself.</p>

<p>     47.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt led off with the left, catching
Bendy on the forehead. Bendy retreated,
hit Caunt as he came in with his left on his
distorted phiz, dropped, and looked up in
derision. Appeal from this species of generalship
seemed now to be idle, and was not
repeated. [He slipped through Caunt’s
hands, which he was entitled to do.&mdash;&#8203;<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor">Ed.</abbr></span>]</p>

<p>     The succeeding ten rounds were fought in
the same style. Little worthy of note
occurred; each in turn obtained some
trifling advantage in the hitting or failing
but neither exhibited any disposition to say
enough, although we thought that Bendigo
from his repeated falls, began to evince
symptoms of fatigue. The confusion round
the ring continued most annoying, although,
the ropes and stakes were still preserved
entire. Many persons, from the pressure of
those behind, were completely exhausted,
and happy to beat a retreat. For ourselves
(<abbr title="Editor">Ed.</abbr> of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>) we had repeatedly to bear
the weight of some half-dozen neighbours,
to which the bodies of both Caunt and
Bendigo were occasionally added as they
fell over the ropes on us. During all this
time the members of the London Ring, with
one or two exceptions (Macdonald and
Johnny Broome in particular), were perfectly
quiescent, and looked on with modest
timidity, evidently afraid to interfere with
the “club law” of the Nottingham bands,
who were regularly organised, and obeyed
the signals of their leaders with a discipline
worthy of a better cause. [An impartial
observation convinced us that Caunt’s
partisans quite rivalled those of Bendigo in
riotous ruffianism.&mdash;&#8203;<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor">Ed.</abbr></span> “Pugilistica.”]</p>

<p>     58.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo “jumped Jim Crow” round
his man, tipped him a left-handed smeller,
and dropped without a return.</p>

<p>     59.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt followed Bendy to the corner
of the ring, hitting out left and right, but
without precision, and certainly without
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pageno">32</span>
doing execution. Bendy nailed him with
his left in the old style, and slipped down,
but instantly jumped up to renew the round.
Caunt, instead of stopping to fight, considering
the round over, ran across the ring
to his corner, Bendy after him, till they
reached the ropes, and after a confused
scramble, in which Bendy used his left and
right behind Caunt’s back, both were down,
amidst general expressions of distaste at
this style of fighting, but loud applause for
Bendy.</p>

<p>     60.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt no sooner on his legs than to
his man, but Bendy escaped his intended
compliments left and right, threw in his left
on the mouth, and dropped, Caunt falling
over him.</p>

<p>     61.&mdash;&#8203;One hour and twenty-four minutes
had now elapsed, but there were still no
symptoms of an approaching termination to
the battle; each appeared fresh on his pins
and strong; and although Caunt showed
awful flesh wounds on his dial, there was
nothing to diminish the hopes of his friends(!)
Bendy exhibited but a few slight contusions,
and although, no doubt, shaken by the falls,
and his own repeated prostrations, he appeared
as active and leary as ever. Caunt,
anxious to be at work, rattled to his man,
hitting left and right, but Bendy retired,
and fell back across the ropes.</p>

<p>     62.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy again on the retreat; Caunt
after him, hitting wildly and without precision
left and right. Bendy gave him an
upper pop with his left, and slipped down.
Caunt was retiring, when Bendy jumped up
again to renew active operations, but Caunt
dropped on his knees, looked up in Bendy’s
face, grinning, as much as to say, “Would
you?” and Bendy, deeming discretion the
better part of valour, contented himself
with shaking his fist and retiring to his
corner. Spring here remarked that jumping
up to hit a man when the round was over,
and when he was unprepared, was as much
foul as striking a man down, and in this we
perfectly concur. [No appeal was made,
but the Squire sent to Clarke to caution his
man that such conduct was dangerous.&mdash;&#8203;<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor">Ed.</abbr></span>]</p>

<p>     63.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt let fly left and right, but
missed his blows. Both slipped down on
their knees in the struggle which followed,
and laughed at each other. In Caunt’s
laugh, from the state of his mug, there was
little of the comic.</p>

<p>     64.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy renewed his hanky-panky
tricks, and trotted round his opponent.
Caunt rushed to him, but he retreated to the
ropes, hit up, and dropped, but instantly
rose again to renew the round. Caunt was
with him, but he again got down, falling
over the bottom rope; and Caunt narrowly
escaped dropping with his knee on a tender
part.</p>

<p>     65.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy again dropped his left on the
sly on Caunt’s damaged phiz, and went
down. Caunt fell over him, jumped up, and
retired to his corner.</p>

<p>     66.&mdash;&#8203;A slight rally, in which wild hits were
exchanged, and Bendy received a pop in the
mouth, which drew the claret. Bendy
dropped on one knee, but, although Caunt
might have hit him in this position, he
merely drew back his hand and refrained.</p>

<p>     67.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy came up cautious, keeping <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à
la distance</span> for a few seconds, when he slyly
approached, popped in a tremendous body
blow with his left, and dropped, as if from
the force of his own delivery, but evidently
from a desire to avoid the return. Caunt
winced under the effect of this hit, and went
to his corner.</p>

<p>     68.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt quickly advanced to his work,
but Bendy retreated to the corner, waited
for him, popped in a slight facer, and, in a
wild scramble, got down.</p>

<p>     69.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy threw in another heavy body
blow with his left, and was going down,
when Caunt, with great adroitness, caught
him round the neck with his left arm, lifted
him completely off the ground, and, holding
him for a few seconds, fell heavily on him.</p>

<p>     70&ndash;73.&mdash;&#8203;Scrambling rounds, in which wild
exchanges took place, and Bendy slipped
down as usual to avoid punishment.</p>

<p>     74.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt to the charge, and Bendy on
the retreat to the corner, where he succeeded
in flinging in his left with terrific force on
Caunt’s damaged cheek, and dropped.</p>

<p>     75.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy again on the retreat, till he
came to the ropes, over which he was forced,
Caunt on him.</p>

<p>     76.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt planted his left on Bendy’s
pimple, and he slipped down.</p>

<p>     77.&mdash;&#8203;A scrambling round, in which both
hit wildly and without effect. Caunt in
vain tried to nail his man with his right;
he was always too high, and Bendy went
down. The uproar without the ring was
tremendous, and whips and sticks were indiscriminately
applied.</p>

<p>     78.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy, after some dodging, delivered
his right heavily on Caunt’s body, and got
down. It was a fearful smack.</p>

<p>     79.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt led off with his left; Bendy
ducked to avoid; and in the close both
were down. Bendy was too cunning to
allow his opponent the chance of the throw.</p>

<p>     80.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy made his favourite sly hit
with his left on Caunt’s smeller, and slipped
down without the account being balanced.
“Time” was very inaccurately kept, a
minute, instead of half that time, being
frequently allowed. [The blame was alternately
in each corner; the seconds continuing
their attentions to their men, heedless of the
call of the holder of the watch.&mdash;&#8203;<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor">Ed.</abbr></span>]</p>

<p>     81.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy again displayed symptoms of
fatigue, and was tenderly nursed. On
coming to the scratch, however, he planted
his left on Caunt’s carcase, and slipped
down.</p>

<p>     82.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt led off. Bendy retreated to
the ropes, and fell backwards stopping, but
instantly jumped up to recommence hostilities,
when Caunt literally ran away
across the ring, with his head down, Bendigo
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">33</span>
after him, hitting him on the back of
his neck. At length Caunt reached his
corner, and in the scramble which followed,
and in which Caunt seemed to have lost his
presence of mind, both went down, amidst
contemptuous shouts at the imputed pusillanimity
of the Champion.</p>

<p>     83.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy, on the retreat, hit up; Caunt
returned the compliment on Bendy’s mouth
with his left, and on Bendy attempting to
get down he caught him round the neck
with undiminished strength, pulled him up,
threw him over, and fell heavily on him.</p>

<p>     84.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy, on being lifted on his second’s
knee, showed blood from the mouth, and
was certainly shaken by the last fall; still
he came up boldly, but cautiously. Caunt
rattled to him left and right, but he retreated
towards the stake, which Caunt caught
with his right as he let fly at him, and
Bendy slipped down, receiving a body tap
as he fell.</p>

<p>     85.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt rushed to his man, but Bendy,
on his attempting to close, got down, unwilling
to risk another heavy fall. He was
obviously getting fatigued from his exertions
and the excessive heat of the sun.</p>

<p>     The uproar was now greater than ever;
the referee was driven into the ring,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
and
the roaring and bawling in favour of Bendigo
and in contempt of Caunt were beyond description.
We [<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor">Ed.</abbr></span> <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>] were overwhelmed
again and again, and were with difficulty
extracted from a pyramid of our
fellow-men by the welcome aid of Jack
Macdonald, our togs torn, and our tile quite
shocking. The exertions of Jem Ward and
others enabled them to restore the referee
to his position, but he was evidently in a
twitter, and the whips and sticks often
reached within an inch of his “castor,”
while they fell heavily on the nobs of some
of his neighbours. Several “Corinthians,”
who endeavoured to brave the storm, were
involved in the general <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span>, and had sufficient
reason to be disgusted with the conduct
of the parties towards whom they are
always disposed to vouchsafe their patronage,
and who, as we have already said,
with few exceptions, looked on inactive.
[These observations are coloured, and form
part of the “manipulation” undergone by
the “report,” as revised under the suggestions
and supervision of the Caunt and
Spring party. The ruin of their confident
hopes was impending.&mdash;&#8203;<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor">Ed.</abbr></span>]</p>

<p>     86.&mdash;&#8203;The Nottingham hero came up
nothing daunted, but with an evident determination
to continue to play the old
soldier. Caunt, as usual, evinced a desire to
get to his opponent, but the latter jumped
away, and waiting his opportunity threw
in his left heavily on the big’un’s eye, and,
in escaping from the retort, slipped down.</p>

<p>     87.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt, although so repeatedly hit,
came up as fresh and strong as ever (?) He
was incapable, however, of parrying the
cunning dodges of Bendy, who again gave
him a stinging rap on the cheek, and, staggering
back, fell, amidst cries of “Foul,” and
appeals from Caunt’s friends to the referee;
but in the din which prevailed no decision
was obtained. [They were both fencing for
“time,” and told by the Squire to “go on.”&mdash;&#8203;<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor">Ed.</abbr></span>
“Pugilistica.”]</p>

<p>     88.&mdash;&#8203;Two hours had now elapsed, and still
there was no apparent approximation towards
a termination of the combat, while the confusion
which prevailed round the ring prevented
anything like a dispassionate criticism
of the operations within. Bendy came up
slowly, while Caunt was evidently disposed
to annihilate him, as indeed his formidable
fists induced every one to believe he would
have done long before, but Bendy prudently
kept out of distance until a slight opening
in the guard of Caunt enabled him to jump
in and deliver his left twice in succession, on
effecting which he slipped down, and looked
up with a triumphant leer at the mystified
Champion.</p>

<p>     89.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy again made himself up for
mischief, and, cleverly avoiding Caunt’s
attempt to reach him left and right, delivered
a heavy hit with his right on the
Champion’s ribs, which was distinctly heard
amidst the row; after which he dropped,
and Caunt retired to the corner.</p>

<p>     90.&mdash;&#8203;A close, and struggle for the fall,
which Caunt easily obtained, falling heavily
on his adversary, and his knee again happily
escaped pressure on a vital part. From
Bendy’s shifty tactics it was impossible for
Caunt to avoid falling as he did. It, however,
led to a fresh appeal by Johnny
Hannan, on the part of Bendigo, and a contradiction
by Molyneux on the part of Caunt.
The umpires disagreed, and the question
having been put to the referee, amidst a
horrible outcry raised by both parties, he
decided “Fair,” declaring that there was
nothing intentional on the part of Caunt.</p>

<p>     91.&mdash;&#8203;A scrambling round. A close, in
which, after having delivered his left, Bendy
contrived to get down, amidst fresh cries of
“Foul,” “Fair.”</p>

<p>     92.&mdash;&#8203;Exchanges of hits with the left, when
Bendy, stooping to avoid the repetition of
Caunt’s blow, as he was going down struck
Caunt below the waistband and near the
bottom of his stomach. Bendy fell on his
back at the moment, while Caunt dropped
his hands upon the place affected, and fell
as if in great pain. An indescribable scene
of turmoil ensued; shouts of “Foul” and
“Fair” escaped from “a thousand tongues&mdash;&#8203;a
thousand pair of iron lungs,” many evidently
influenced by their desires and not
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>
their convictions. There is no doubt that
the blow, according to the rules of the Ring,
was foul; but that it was intentional we
cannot say, as it was struck when Bendy was
in the act of falling. At last the umpires,
disagreeing, made the customary appeal to
the referee, who, almost deafened by the
roaring of the multitude, finally said he had
not seen the blow, and consequently could
not pronounce it foul.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span>
The seconds immediately
returned to their principals, and the
latter, time being called, commenced the</p>

<p>     93rd and last round.&mdash;&#8203;The men were quickly
at the scratch, and Caunt commenced
operating left and right, catching Bendy
slightly on the forehead. Bendigo was forced
back upon the ropes almost in a recumbent
position, but got up and was again knocked
down, and Caunt turned from him, considering
the round had concluded. Bendy, however,
awake to every chance of administering
punishment, jumped up as he had done
before, and rushing after Caunt, who was
half turned from him, was about to let fly,
when Caunt dropped on his nether end,
evidently disinclined to renew or continue
that round.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span>
And now a final, and, as it
turned out, a decisive appeal was made to
the referee (not by the umpires, but by Jem
Ward, Hannan, and others), who, with very
little hesitation, pronounced the fatal word
“Foul,” declaring that he considered Caunt
had deliberately violated the rules of the
Ring by going down without a blow, and
had therefore lost the fight. This verdict
was hailed with the loudest vociferations by
the roughs, and Bendy, without further
delay, was borne off the scene of his unexpected
triumph by his partisans, and carried
to his carriage amidst reiterated acclamations.
So sudden was this issue to the affair that
thousands were for some time unable to discover
who was the real victor, many imagining
that the foul blow in the previous round
had led to the decision being against Bendigo.
It was only by those immediately contiguous
to the ring that the true state of the case
was known; and the mortification and disappointment
of the friends of Caunt, who
stood up immediately afterwards to renew
the fight, were beyond description. Caunt
himself, as well as Spring and his seconds,
was incredulous as to the result, but personal
application to the referee, who had
escaped from the rabble, left no doubt on the
subject. He declared “he had seen Caunt
go down without a blow, and that upon his
conviction of the unfairness of such conduct,
he had pronounced against him.” Spring
remarked that there had been clearly an
exchange of blows; that to all appearance the
round had been finished; and that when
Caunt went down he did so from a determination
not to be taken by surprise or to
renew the struggle till “time” was again
called. The referee said, in answer, he was
not aware of this fact, nor had such a representation
been made to him. He judged from
what he saw in the overwhelming difficulties
in which he was placed, and he had given
his decision accordingly. He had been chosen
referee by both parties, and he had accepted
the office against his own inclination. In
discharging his duty he had done so impartially
to the best of his abilities, and certainly
had no bias in favour of one man or
the other. What he had said could not now
be recalled, and therefore the business was
at an end. We must here repeat that the
umpires were not consulted, nor did they
express any difference of opinion. It was
the duty of the referee to have withheld his
decision till properly appealed to, not by the
interested partisans, but by the appointed
officials, who were on the other side of the
ring from him, and could hold no immediate
communication with him. He ought to have
been placed between those persons. He was
clearly bullied and hurried into a premature
judgment. Had he been allowed to reflect,
we are persuaded he would have hesitated in
pronouncing a fiat which the state of Bendigo
rendered almost indispensable to his success.</p>

<p>     The time occupied by “the battle,” such
as it was, according to our watch, when we
could venture to have a peep at it, was two
hours and ten minutes. We do not intend
to speak to a minute, nor is a minute more
or less important on this occasion, few bets
having been made on “time,” and those certainly
not having reference to so long a
period as that recorded. We heard that long
odds were taken that Caunt won in half an
hour, and others that Bendy would not be
licked, if at all, in one hour, and these
are of course settled by the issue of the
fight, as well as the first blood and first
knock-down blow, both of which were
properly booked to Bendy. On Bendy
reaching his carriage, we are informed he
was dreadfully exhausted from the repetition
of heavy falls to which he had been exposed,
as well as his own continued exertions under
a broiling sun; but his punishment being of
comparatively a trifling description, he soon
recovered on the application of proper restoratives.
The only perceptible marks of
the visitations of Caunt to his cranium were
a cut over his right eye, a few contusions of
the cheek, mouth, scalp, and forehead, and a
little enlargement of his auricular organ.
He was quickly conveyed from the ground
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">35</span>
to his “quarters,” both he and his friends
highly elated at the result of their operations.
Caunt, on quitting the arena, although
displaying convincing marks of the severity
with which his opponent could use his
mawleys, was strong on his legs, but dreadfully
mortified at having been thus suddenly
stripped of his laurels, and deprived of the
proud distinction which he had so long held.
Spring, who had throughout acted as his
<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">fidus Achates</span>, was not less mentally depressed;
he was “dead beat,” not only
from his incessant exertions to procure “fair
play” throughout the fight and the cowardly
assaults to which he was exposed, but from
a perfect conviction that the decision against
his man was not only premature, but utterly
opposed to the rules of the Ring. He lost
no time in returning with Caunt to the Cock,
at Stony Stratford, and the great event of
the day having been concluded, the immense
multitude followed suit. The scenes exhibited
on the road home were of the most
extraordinary description. Every house of
entertainment was besieged, and the call for
swizzle so continuous that many of the best-filled
cellars were exhausted, and even water
at last became an acceptable luxury to those
who never pretended to be patrons of the
hydropathic system. We have neither time
nor space however to dwell on these vicissitudes,
and shall proceed at once to offer such
general observations as the events of the
day seem to warrant.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Upon the character of “the
Great Fight for the Championship of
England,” we have no doubt our readers
have formed their own opinions. During
the last thirty years it has been our fate to
witness almost every important battle in
the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, but we confess, although we have
occasionally had to record transactions of
the most discreditable description, and to
administer castigation to wrong-doers in no
measured terms, the proceedings on Tuesday
far exceed in enormity anything we had
before witnessed.</p>

<p>     With regard to the pretensions of the two
men who took so prominent a part in the
day’s proceedings, few remarks are necessary.
Caunt, although a big man, and
possessed of great physical strength, does
not possess the attributes of an accomplished
boxer. He is deficient in science, and wants
the art of using the gifts of nature with that
tact and precision which are calculated to
ensure success. There was a wildness and
indecision in his deliveries which prevented
his doing execution, and the major part of
his blows either flew over Bendigo’s head
or were short or wide of their destination.
Had he been steady and self-possessed,
and hitting at points, this would
not have been the case, and did he understand
the perfect art of self-defence, four-fifths
of the punishment he received might
have been avoided; but he left himself open
to attack, and thus his opponent was enabled
to plant on him with stinging severity.
With a man of his own bulk the case might
have been different; and perhaps there are
few if any of the present day who would
prove superior to him in fair fighting.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Our own opinion of the fight may be gathered from the few brief notes
we have bracketed in the report. The immense amount of assertion and
rejoinder which filled the sporting papers for weeks was “flat, stale and unprofitable.”
The stakeholder being served with legal notice to return the
stakes, the referee (George Osbaldiston, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>) wrote thus to that
gentleman:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">“<i>To the Editor of</i> ‘<span class="sc">Bell’s Life in London</span>.’</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;&#8203;An appeal having been made to me, as referee, by Mr. Spring, to reverse my
decision in the late fight between Bendigo and Caunt, on grounds unworthy of my consideration,
I request you will confirm that decision by paying over the stakes to Bendigo, who, in
my opinion, is justly entitled to them. It was with the greatest reluctance, and at the
particular request of my friends and the unanimous solicitations of the backers of the men,
that I accepted the office; but I shall always consider it one of the greatest acts of folly I
ever was guilty of in my life. In discharging my duty I endeavoured to do justice to the
contending parties to the best of my abilities and judgment; and, arriving at the conclusion
I did, and now confirm, I was actuated only by a complete conviction of the justness of my
decision, and not by the intimidation of the roughs, as stated by Mr. Spring in his letter.”
After some further remarks in reply to Spring, the referee goes on to say:&mdash;&#8203;“Had I been
under the intimidation of the ‘roughs’ I had several opportunities of putting an end to the
fight before the conclusion by foul acts on the part of Caunt. A noble lord, and several gentlemen
who stood close by me during the whole fight, can corroborate this statement. I most positively
deny that I stated to any one that a man going down without a blow, after he himself
had treacherously delivered blows, was fair. In no one instance, in my judgment, did Bendigo

break the laws of fair fighting. I must also deny, in the most positive manner, that I ever
stated to any person that I did not see the last round. I saw every round distinctly and
clearly, and when Caunt came up the last round he had evidently not recovered from the
92nd. After the men were in position Bendigo very soon commenced operations, and
Caunt turned round directly and skulked away, with his back to Bendigo, and sat down on
his nether end. He never knocked Bendigo down once in the fight, nor ever got him against
the ropes in the last round. In my opinion Caunt got away as soon as he could from Bendigo,
fell without a blow to avoid being hit out of time, and fairly lost the fight.</p>

</div><!--end letter-->

<p>In 1849 the Championship was certainly at a low ebb. Con Parker, a
big brother of Tass, so it was publicly said, challenged the distinction, after
beating Jem Bailey in a scrambling fight in February of that year, and
received a forfeit from the Tipton Slasher in September. He
was a great, hulking pretender, of 6<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> high, and about 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, but his
pretensions were quickly snuffed out by Tass Parker (weight 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>),
who showed at Frimley Green, on November 26th, in 27 rounds, that
Master Con had no points of a fighting man about him. Con went to
America, and died soon after suddenly. As Tass declined to call himself
Champion, there was literally no Champion at all. In this interregnum, at
the beginning of 1850, the bold Bendigo called upon the editor of <cite>Bell’s
Life</cite>, and declared that sooner than the title should be so knocked about
he would once more do battle for the honour of the Ring. He then left
£10 with the editor as an earnest that he was ready to meet any man in
England, for £200 a side, half-way between home and home. At the same
time it was stated that Bendy and Caunt had met, shaken hands, and buried
the past in oblivion. Caunt had undertaken to stand a portion of Bendy’s
battle-money, fight whom he might, and Bendy, to prove his sincerity, had
presented Caunt with the belt with which he had been girded by Jem
Ward after his defeat of the Deaf ’un. The Nottingham challenge
was not long unanswered. Caunt and Bendigo, the new Orestes and
Pylades, took, three weeks later&mdash;&#8203;namely, February 4th, 1850&mdash;&#8203;a joint
benefit at the National Baths, Westminster Road.</p>

<p>Now, Johnny Broome had, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad interim</span>, stated publicly that he had an unknown
whom he was ready to back against Bendy for his own sum. Accordingly,
after a friendly glove-bout with Harry Broome, Tom Paddock
came forward, and announcing himself as Johnny’s “Unknown,” declared his
readiness to post, and make a match with Bendy for £200 a side. Peter
Crawley responded, and £30 was staked, the next meeting to take place at
Peter’s house, the “Queen’s Head and French Horn,” Smithfield, on the
next Tuesday. This merely produced a stormy meeting upon details,
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pageno">37</span>
deposits, and a stakeholder, and a further adjournment to another night, to
meet at Jem Burn’s. Here the matter was finally adjusted, and accordingly
the men met on the 5th of June, 1850.</p>

<p>It was much to Bendigo’s credit that on this occasion he took unusual
pains with his training, and came to the post in prime fettle, looking, as a
friend said, “fresh as a four-year-old,” though verging on his fortieth year.
When we saw him we felt some misgiving about the stability of his
damaged knee; he walked unmistakably lame, and the whole left side was
evidently lower than the right.</p>

<p>The articles provided that the fight should take place, as nearly as possible,
half-way between London and Nottingham&mdash;&#8203;the stakeholder to name the
place. The recollection of former events in which Bendy had been concerned
led to some difficulty in making a selection, and after much consideration
it was determined that Mildenhall Road Station, in the county
of Suffolk, should be the fixture, that place being, by road, rather nearer to
Nottingham than to London; but, as it turned out, the travelling by rail
gave the advantage to the London party&mdash;&#8203;the Nottingham folks having to
make three changes before they reached the ground, while the Londoners
proceeded direct.</p>

<p>Due notice of the place was given to the parties interested on the
Tuesday week before the mill, and they made such arrangements as best
suited them. A special train was announced to start from Shoreditch Station
at precisely eight o’clock on the morning of fighting. It was resolved only to
have first and second class carriages, and that the fares should be £2 and
£1 respectively for conveyance “there and back.” Third-class carriages
were rejected to prevent the obtrusion of persons whose presence is invariably
productive of disorder. Public notice was given of this arrangement,
and on the morning in question, the weather being in every way
desirable, the arrival, in rapid succession, of cabs, <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> in which an
unusual number of Corinthians were perceptible, evinced the spirit that
was abroad.</p>

<p>We must now turn to Bendigo. It would seem that during the previous
week his Nottingham friends had come in great numbers to visit him at his
training quarters, and being of the rough class, and not very particular
when out for a spree, they contrived to create so much prejudice in the
minds of the quiet and easy folk of the neighbourhood, that an application
was made for a warrant to apprehend Bendigo on his way to the battle-field,
and this warrant was placed in the hands of a constable for execution.
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">38</span>
Bendigo had previously shifted his quarters, and taken up his abode at
the house of a staunch friend, whence, on Monday, he proceeded to a
station eight miles from Nottingham, intending thence to depart for the
scene of action. Here he was recognised by a “blue,” and an attempt was
made to take him into custody. Bendy, however, being on the alert, broke
from the grasp of the Philistines, and rushed through the house in which he
was to a back yard, locking the door as he retreated. He then scrambled
over some pig-sties, reached the open country, and by a circuitous route
gained the main road, where a fly followed, picked him up, and conveyed him
on his course. Police were mounted as quickly as possible, but too late to
overtake the fugitive, who reached Newark, posted on to Stamford, where
he slept, and on Tuesday evening reached in safety the Railway Tavern at
Mildenhall, where he took up his quarters for the night, thus safely evading
the trap which had been laid for his detention; and here he was found,
surrounded by a good many friends, on the arrival of the metropolitan
division.</p>

<p>An admirable inner and outer ring were formed on a spot about a quarter
of a mile from the station, and few meetings had taken place in modern
times at which there were so many persons of rank and consideration
assembled. The total number of spectators was under 2,000, and the partisans
of the men were pretty evenly balanced.</p>

<p>Soon after twelve o’clock, Paddock, who had been reposing under some
shady trees, approached the scene of action, and, flinging his tile into the
ring, was received with loud applause. It was nearly one o’clock before
Bendy put in an appearance. He seemed in perfect good humour, but exhibited
none of those antics by which his early career was distinguished.
He was quiet and easy in his deportment, and submitted himself to the
guidance of Jemmy the Black and Jack Hannan. Paddock was escorted
into the arena by Solid Coates and Macdonald. There was a grim smile
upon his countenance. He approached Bendy, and they shook hands with
apparent cordiality. Bendy pulled a roll of bank notes from his pocket,
as if intending to challenge his opponent to make a bet, but this Paddock
declined. The toss for choice of corners was won by Bendy, and to the
surprise of many he selected that in which he had to stare old Sol in the
face; and perhaps his solar majesty never put forth a more glowing phiz,
for in truth it was “phizzing” hot throughout the day, and the shades of
umbrellas were sought for the protection of both men, who seated themselves
on the ground in their respective corners, while the usual discussion
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pageno">39</span>
arose concerning the selection of a referee. This knotty point led to a
variety of difficulties. Several persons, noblemen and gentlemen, were
suggested and rejected, and at last serious apprehensions were entertained
that there would be no fight. Finally, the representative of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, who
had twice refused the office, was induced, rather than spoil sport, to waive
his own feelings on the subject, and to undertake a duly as unpleasant as it
proved to be dangerous.</p>

<p>The men then commenced their toilettes. They fought in sparrow-bills
instead of the objectionable spikes. On being completely peeled, their condition
and physical pretensions were open for general criticism. Bendigo
appeared extremely well in health, but thinner than usual, his weight not
exceeding 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 9½lb., being 2<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> less than when he fought Caunt. His
face also looked thinner, and, it could not be denied, betrayed the advance
of time, and although not an old man, when compared with Paddock he
certainly might be pronounced a veteran warrior. He was very quiet, and
evidently foresaw that he had his work to do&mdash;&#8203;work which he resolved to
perform for the last time with as much acuteness as his experience could
suggest. Paddock looked as fresh and fit as his best friends could desire.
His face presented a glow of florid health, and there was nothing superfluous
about his frame. Immediately beneath his drawers was a strengthening
plaister, which seemed to cover his loins. He stood much taller than
Bendigo, over whom his length of reach appeared to give him a decided
advantage. Regarding the general appearance of the two men, the current
seemed strongly to run in favour of youth; but, notwithstanding this apparent
discrepancy, two to one was offered on Bendigo. The customary overtures
having been adjusted, time was called, and the men appeared at the scratch.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;At twenty minutes to two the
men were in position, Bendigo right foot
foremost, with his arms close to his chest,
and waiting for the attack. Paddock, on
the contrary, had both arms stretched out
before him, evidently, to our judgment, too
much so to admit of heavy delivery. He
made two or three steps forward, as if to
commence the attack, but Bendy stepped
back. Paddock exhibited great anxiety to
get to work. Bendigo shifted his ground
and got away. They played round each
other in this way for a second or
two, when Paddock came to a standstill,
crossed his arms on his breast,
and looked thoughtfully at the “old’un.”
At last Paddock commenced his long-armed
operations, and both flung out their feelers
left and right, but without getting home.
They fought wildly, and missed their blows.
In the close Paddock was down, Bendy on
him; but the trifling taps which reached
their persons would not have ruffled the
wing of a butterfly.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock quick to the scratch, impatient
to get to work; and slight taps were
exchanged, Bendy on Paddock’s body, and
Paddock returning the compliment with
his right. It was a scrambling affair, and
the round ended in Bendigo getting down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock again rushed to the charge
with more impatience than judgment, popped
in a slight slap with his right on Bendy’s
nut, and was following up his tactics, when
Bendy pirouetted round. Paddock pursued
him with resolution, and as he was on the
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pageno">40</span>
retreat let fly with his right, which, catching
Bendy on the ribs, tumbled him down, amidst
the cheers of the Redditch representatives.
(First knock-down for Paddock.)</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;No sooner was “time” called than
Paddock rushed to the scratch, his arms still
too much in advance. Bendigo adopted the
dodging system, retreating from his man, and
got away. Paddock, however, would not be
denied, hit out wildly left and right, Bendigo
covering his head with both arms, and again
turning round on the pirouetting principle.
Paddock fought fast and wild, but without
precision. Bendigo, equally abroad, hit out
twice, but missed his destination, and in the
close went down.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock up and at it still, but without
the judgment of a good tactician. He
missed left and right, but rushed on with
such vigour that Bendigo was again obliged
to retreat with a twirling evolution, and in
avoiding Paddock’s wild pursuit got down&mdash;&#8203;Paddock
pointing at him with his finger
with contempt.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy came coolly to the scratch,
looking as cunning as an old fox, and prepared
for the attack. He had not long to
wait, for Paddock, with his usual impetuosity,
dashed to his work, Bendy getting
away. Paddock followed him up till they
reached the ropes, and a hasty rally followed,
when Paddock popped in his left and right,
the latter on Bendy’s ear. Bendy returned
the compliment, hit out left and right,
caught Paddock on the left eyebrow, and
dropped. First blood was now claimed for
Bendy, a slight tinge being perceptible on
Paddock’s left eyebrow.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock again as quick as lightning
to the scratch, and after some wild but
very ineffective exchanges, Bendy went
down. As he lay Paddock held his foot
above his body, as if intending to scrunch
him; but luckily, whatever might have been
his wishes, he had discretion enough to resist
the momentary impulse.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock no sooner up than at it;
Bendy on the retreat, and twirling round to
avoid his resolute pursuer. Paddock
followed him till they closed at the ropes,
over which Bendy fell, Paddock on him.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock again too hastily to business,
when, after some wild exchanges, they
closed. Paddock grappled his man, and, as
he held him in his left arm, chopped his nob
with his right, till he slipped down on his
nether end.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock pursued his fast tactics, but
so wild were the deliveries on both sides
that no serious mischief was done; and in
the close, in trying for the fall, they were
both down, Bendy uppermost.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock hit short with his left;
Bendy got away. Paddock would not be
denied, delivered his left and right, and
closed, when after a severe struggle
(Paddock chopping with his right) Bendigo
was thrown over the ropes. On getting up
blood was perceptible on the left brow of
Bendigo; so far, therefore, the punishment
was pretty much upon a par.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock impatiently rushed to his
man, hit wildly with his left, and closed at
the ropes. A short struggle; both down,
Bendy undermost.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, quick to work, gave the
“old ’un” no time for reflection, dashed at
him left and right, tumbled him over the
ropes, and fell on him. The youth and
vigour of Paddock up to this time seemed to
have put all Bendy’s memorable tactics at
defiance, and although nothing had been
done to produce a sensation in the way of
punishment on either side, the manner in
which Bendy retreated from his opponent,
which was so utterly unexpected, produced
a strong feeling to his disfavour, and those
who had so freely backed him in the first
instance, turned round and laid against him;
in fact, six to four was offered on Paddock.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;The quickness of Paddock’s onslaughts
obviously set Bendigo’s bellows in motion;
he was, however, ready at the call of “time,”
and met the coming charge with determination.
Some heavy hits were exchanged,
Paddock catching the lion’s share. In the
close there was a desperate struggle for the
fall, during which Bendigo, to resist the
throw, caught Paddock round the face with
his right, amidst a cry of “He’s gouging
him.” It was asserted that he was endeavouring
to force his fingers into his eye,
but it was not so. His hand was against
Paddock’s bleeding cheek. In the end Bendy
was down, Paddock on him. Complaint
was made to the referee of the alleged
gouging, but the evidence was not sufficient
to justify any interruption of the fight on
that account.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock was not to be restrained;
he rushed across the ring, delivered his left
twice, and Bendigo, in getting away, fell.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;The fighting on the part of Paddock
was still at railway speed, not a little exhausting
to both men in the heat of the
sun. Bendy fought on the get-away
principle, and after some wild exchanges
Paddock slipped down, Bendy falling over
him.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;A determined rally, in which heavy
hits were exchanged; Bendy catching it on
the nob and nose, from whence the blood
trickled. They stood well to their work,
Paddock never flinching, and in the end
Bendy was down.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, as resolute as ever, rushed
in left and right; his hands were, however,
too far from his body, and his execution not
effective. Bendigo waited his opportunity,
and popped in his right on Paddock’s cheek,
on which he made another incision. A
scrambling rally followed, which ended in
Bendy being down. The fighting was the
reverse of scientific, and as wild as at a
country fair.
</p>
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pageno">41</span>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, so impatient was he to be
at work, rose from his second’s knee before
time was called. Bendigo dodged from his
corner, but in getting away slipped down
without a blow. He was evidently playing
the old soldier and reserving his strength,
while Paddock was putting forth all his
energies. The referee called on Paddock’s
seconds to check his impetuosity, and to prevent
his running over the scratch to meet
his man.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, to time again, dropped on
Bendy’s nob with his right twice in succession.
Bendy down and threw up his
hands; the fighting was too fast for his
taste, and the young one would not be
denied; still on Bendy’s frontispiece there
were few marks of punishment, save on his
left ear, which was considerably swollen from
Paddock’s occasional pats.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Another ferocious onslaught by
Paddock; wild hits were exchanged in
Bendy’s corner, where he dropped.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, as usual, first to work, but
Bendy succeeded in planting a left-handed
stinger on Paddock’s cheek-bone, drawing
more claret. A rally in the corner; both
down, and Bendy undermost.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo waited for Paddock’s
charge, and gave him a heavy counter-hit
with his left. A rally followed, in
which Bendy popped in his right three times
in succession on Paddock’s ribs. Paddock
was not idle, and, in the close at the ropes,
continued hammering away with his right as
Bendy fell on the ropes. A cry of “Foul,”
but the referee decided “Fair.” Bendy had
not reached the ground.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;A scrambling close, in which both
were down; not much mischief done.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock to business, and after some
trifling exchanges Bendy got down on the
saving system.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;No time lost; Paddock up and ready,
when Bendy rattled in and delivered a
terrible smasher on Paddock’s smeller, and
fell. More claret from Paddock, and cries
of “The old ’un’s not beaten yet.”</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;To business in earnest. Paddock got
home slightly with his left. Bendy down
in getting away, when Paddock followed
him and delivered an upper-cut with his
right; and as he was getting away, Bendy
jumped up, retorted, and a desperate rally
followed, in which heavy hits were exchanged.
Bendy down and up again. Bendy
ultimately down. Paddock had lost control
over his temper, and was wild with excitement.
The punishment to both was severe,
although not so perceptible on Bendy, from
the blows being delivered on the side of his
head and ear.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock got home with his left on
Bendy’s optic, and Bendy fell.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy no sooner at the scratch than
dropped by a delivery from Paddock’s right
on the side of the head.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, more impatient than ever,
darted across the ring to his man, hit left
and right with his customary wildness, and
repeating the dose with his left; Bendy
down. The fight had now lasted thirty-five
minutes.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Wild fighting; Bendy down to
avoid.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;The fighting all one way. Paddock
rattled in left and right as before, not giving
Bendy time to arrive at the scratch, and
almost before “time” was called delivering
his one, two.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;On Bendigo the marks of punishment
were not prominent, and he was as cool and
quiet as ever. Paddock delivered left and
right, and Bendigo fell.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock in left and right, as heretofore.
Bendigo, retreating, fell back under
the ropes. Paddock dropped on him with
his knees. Another appeal of foul rejected,
on the plea that Paddock’s fall was unavoidable.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;Again did Bendy fall, after Paddock
had delivered slightly left and right. This
dropping system of Bendy’s created a strong
feeling of disgust, but it was clear that he
was out-fought, and could not resist the
vigorous attacks of his antagonist. He was
obviously “biding his time.”</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;A wild but rattling rally. The men
fought and closed at the ropes, over which
Bendy hung, Paddock peppering away at him
from above. Another appeal of foul, which
the referee again rejected, to the danger of
his life. Several of the Nottingham division
threatened him with their sticks, charging
him with gross partiality, and asserting that
the fight had been lost over and over again.
The referee repeated his caution to Paddock’s
friends to restrain his impetuosity and keep
his temper.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;A lively rally, in which some wild
hits, left and right, were exchanged. Both
were down. Another appeal was made, on
the ground that Paddock had been using
turpentine and resin on his hands, contrary
to the 27th rule of the Ring, by which it is
provided “that the use of resin be deemed
foul.” A suspicion existed that Paddock
had been provided with resin in a dissolved
state before the fight commenced, and a
protest was entered against its use. Paddock
was brought to the referee for examination,
and there could be no doubt that his hands
had been smeared with resin, but whether
put on before the fight commenced, or after,
could not be proved. The referee pronounced
that such practice was foul, but, in the
absence of direct evidence ordered that his
hands should be washed, and that the fight
should proceed&mdash;&#8203;much to the renewed distaste
or Bendigo’s friends, whose exclamations
of partiality were vociferous.</p>

<p>     38.&mdash;&#8203;The delay occasioned by this examination
gave an opportunity for Bendigo
to recover his second wind, and come fresher
to the scratch, for on time being called he
waited steadily for his man, and on his
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pageno">42</span>
coming in met him with a tremendous hit
with his right on the bridge of the nose,
drawing his cork in a most decided manner;
the blood came trickling from his proboscis
in a purple stream, and, after a short rally,
both were down. The last hit made a decided
turn in “the affairs of man,” and more especially
in the minds of Bendy’s patrons, who
cheered lustily.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo again made himself up for
mischief, and after stopping Paddock’s one,
two, he delivered three loud sounding
whacks on his ribs, which were heard all
round the ring. A wild rally followed, and
Bendy was down. The betting was now
evens; Bendy was taken for choice.</p>

<p>     40.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy came up like “a giant refreshed.”
He clearly saw he had brought his
man to his level. He met him as he came
bouncing in, stopped, closed, grappled for
the throw, and fell on him. Renewed
shouts from the Nottinghamites.</p>

<p>     41.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock came up, the claret still
dripping from his nose. A wild rally, a
close at the ropes, and Bendy down.</p>

<p>     42.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, on getting into his corner,
dropped his head as if stung by hits recently
received. Still he obeyed the call of “time”
as game as a pebble. Bendy, who had also
reposed in his corner, got up fresher on his
pins, waited for him, again parried his left and
right, and once more delivered three heavy
body blows with his left, and fell laughing.</p>

<p>     43.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy up at the usual summons, and
steady. Paddock impetuously rushed to the
attack, Bendy meeting him left and right as
he came in. Paddock hit away left and
right, forced him back on the ropes, and fell
on him.</p>

<p>     44.&mdash;&#8203;Again, after a short struggle at the
ropes, did Paddock fall over Bendy.</p>

<p>     45.&mdash;&#8203;A wild rally, in which there were
some flying hits exchanged, but Paddock
wanted steadiness&mdash;&#8203;he was too impatient&mdash;&#8203;and
Bendy played the part of Master Reynard.
In the close Paddock was down.</p>

<p>     46.&mdash;&#8203;The heat of the weather began to tell
on both, and each showed symptoms of
fatigue. After a short pause there was a
lively rally, in which Paddock received
another visitation on the left cheek, and
Bendy was down.</p>

<p>     47.&mdash;&#8203;A slight rally, in which exchanges
were made, Bendy getting home with his left
and going down smiling.</p>

<p>     48.&mdash;&#8203;Six and seven to four were now
offered on Bendy, but no takers. The
fight had lasted fifty-seven minutes. Paddock
had lost none of his precipitate propensities;
he rattled to his man, still fresh on
his legs, but wild and passionate. Bendy
retreated, Paddock after him, and Bendy, in
avoiding, fell. Paddock struck him as he
was down, and just brushed the top of his
head with his right. Another cry of “Foul,”
but the referee considered Paddock could not
restrain the blow, and the appeal was once
more rejected, and another urgent caution
given to Paddock’s seconds to prevent his
throwing a chance away.</p>

<p>     49, and last.&mdash;&#8203;Bendy waited for his man,
but did not wait long. Paddock was with
him, and, after an exchange of blows, Bendy
fell on the lower rope, which, from being
loose, let him down on the ground, and in
this position, with his hands up, Paddock
deliberately hit his man with his right on the
side of the head twice. The last and final
appeal was then made, and the referee had
now no other option than to pronounce
“Foul,” being perfectly satisfied that the
man was on the ground when the blow was
given.</p>

<p>     The decision, of course, produced a great
uproar among the losers; and, on Bendigo
coming up to have it confirmed, Paddock,
who had completely lost his temper, and
while he was not offering the slightest
resistance, hit him down almost at the feet
of the referee. Thus ended this most unsatisfactory
battle, with little credit to Bendigo,
although strictly in accordance with the
14th rule of the Ring&mdash;&#8203;“That a blow struck
when a man is thrown or down shall be
deemed foul.” There were those, of course,
who repudiated the decision of the referee,
and who, perhaps, without the same opportunity
of seeing the real state of the men,
considered that Bendy was not actually on
the ground. There was not the slightest
doubt, however, that he was seated on terra
firma, with both his arms spread out, and
his legs flat; and in this position Paddock,
in the absence of that caution which the
referee had so repeatedly recommended, foreseeing
what would happen, committed the
fatal mistake which ended in his chances
being put out of court. It was thought by
some that he struck foul for the express
purpose of terminating his labours.</p>

<p>     The confusion which followed was immense.
The friends of Paddock were, of
course, clamorous, and highly incensed at
the disappointment of their hopes. There
was, however, no help for it; the decision
was strictly in accordance with rule, and
although certainly mortifying could not have
been otherwise if the laws were to be obeyed,
added to which, Paddock had been over and
over again cautioned against suffering his
temper to get the better of his judgment. It
is said that his seconds urged him to go in;
this might be the case, but they should also
have impresed upon him&mdash;&#8203;if he were capable
of guidance&mdash;&#8203;what must be the sure
result of intemperance, on which Bendigo
and his coadjutors no doubt relied. However
provoking it might be for Bendigo to get
down to avoid mischief&mdash;&#8203;too much the practice
of pugilists of modern times&mdash;&#8203;in Bendigo’s
case might be justified by the superior strength
and length of his antagonist. It does not
follow that the breach of a clear rule is to be
overlooked. Indeed, the reader can hardly
fail to perceive that the referee was slow to
decide against Paddock where he had any
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pageno">43</span>
excuse for palliating his errors. These were
considerations, however, which did not
weigh with the angry party; they followed
the referee out of the ring with volumes of
abuse, and finally one of the gang (Long
Charley Smith, of Birmingham) stealthily
came behind him, and with a bludgeon
dealt him a terrific blow on the back of the
head, which for a moment paralysed him.
Fortunately Tom Spring, who was behind,
and heard the blow, turned round to prevent
a repetition of the cowardly assault (narrowly
escaping a similar compliment intended
for himself by another ruffian), and
the assassin fled, although his companions,
also well known, remained to applaud
the act with the consoling exclamation
of “Sarved him right.” The effects of
the concussion were serious, and subjected
the sufferer to some inconvenience, probably
to the triumph of those by whom it was
abetted. Mr. Vincent Dowling was not one
likely to seek redress for an act which no
man, however sunk in degradation, in his
moments of cool reflection can approve, and
which certainly could receive no sympathy
from the lovers of fair play.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Of the character of the fight
we cannot speak in terms of praise.
Bendigo was clearly overmatched; it was
old age opposed to youth, vigour, and
determination. In the early rounds of
the fight he found his mistake. He
could not withstand the impetuous rushes
of the young’un, whose tactics were to bear
down all the shifty dodges of his opponent,
and this he did with a vengeance, and with
a precipitation altogether at variance with
sound discretion, although, for a time, Bendigo’s
knowledge of the art was set at
naught by it. The rapidity of the rounds&mdash;&#8203;49
in 59 minutes&mdash;&#8203;will show that there was
little time for reflection on either side.
Bendy soon discovered that he had “caught
a Tartar,” and not, as he imagined, “a
yokel.” Physically he was incapable
of resisting the avalanche of sinew
and bone which poured upon him, and
as the only resource he had recourse to the
distasteful practice of getting down, when
he found destruction inevitable. This all
practitioners will pronounce perfectly consistent
with rule; as no man can be expected,
for the mere gratification of the
spectators, to submit to punishment if he
can avoid it by legal expedients. The
editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> is candid enough to
admit that he had a prejudice against
Bendigo. We may add that the reading of
his report of Bendigo’s third fight with
Caunt fully shows this. For his own sake,
and that of his friends, it was Bendigo’s
duty to make the most of his knowledge
and strength, and to husband whatever
powers he possessed. This he did to the
best of his ability, and had the worst of the
battle, as the betting would show, till
Paddock, by his own headstrong career,
began to exhibit the effects of his own
folly; he was, in fact, reduced to the level
of his crafty antagonist, who, the moment
he saw his time, came out with his reserve,
and the blows which he then administered
were of stinging effect, quickly perceptible
by the judges, who, foreseeing the
storm approaching, turned round to get
out of their difficulties, and, from being
a non-favourite, Bendigo soon had the
call at six to four. The effects of this
change were obvious; Paddock became
still more wild, and rushed to his work without
temper or reflection, although repeatedly
called to by the referee to be careful in
avoiding that which was easily foreseen, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>,
the delivery of a foul blow. More than once
was he saved from the consequences of his
precipitation by the indulgence of the referee;
there were doubts of which he had the
benefit, to the personal risk of the referee;
and yet at last he fell into the trap which
was laid for him, and left to the referee no
other option than to pronounce judgment
against him&mdash;&#8203;a judgment which was given
with reluctance, but, as every impartial
witness of the battle must acknowledge, with
justice.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>With regard to the state of the men, we may mention that Paddock
reached London, per special train, the same night, little the worse for wear,
with the exception of his swollen mazzard and damaged snout. The
same night, however, it was discovered that he had seriously injured his
right hand, which he had to submit to surgical inspection, and for some
weeks he wore his arm in a sling, and his hand protected by a splint.</p>

<p>Bendigo remained at the “Railway Tavern” till the London trains had
departed, and in due course commenced his return, with his friends, to
Nottingham, where he arrived the same night by the express train. His
success had been telegraphed, and an immense crowd assembled to hail his
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pageno">44</span>
return&mdash;&#8203;a band of music being prepared to strike up “See the conquering
hero comes.” He proceeded to his brother’s house, where, upon examination,
his injuries appeared more serious than had been supposed. In a
fortnight after the battle Bendigo came to town and received the battle-money
at Jem Burn’s, when he declared in a formal manner his intention
of finally retiring from the ring. Hereupon the Tipton Slasher, who was
present, and who had recovered from his illness, again laid claim to the
Championship, offering to meet any man in England for £200 to £300 a
side, or to fight Tom Paddock and stake £350. This led to a match for
£150 a side, but this ended in a draw. A second match was soon after
arranged, which came off on the 17th December, 1850, at Woking, the
details of which will be found in the history of the career of the Tipton
Slasher.</p>

<p>This time Bendy kept his word, and thenceforward confined his eccentricities
to occasional outbursts at Nottingham elections and other occasions
of public holidays and festivities. In some of these escapades he afforded
considerable amusement to the public, and employment to the pens of provincial
reporters, by the mother wit of his defence, or the ludicrous aspect
he imparted to the results of his fistic or gymnastic evolutions. After some
solemn promises of amendment made to their worships, and a pledge to
Father Mathew (he was never a sot), we heard of Bendy’s “conversion,”
and of his appearance in the white choker (he always wore the straight hair)
of a dissenting preacher. On the occasion of a visit to London, in which
he was introduced to a congregation of the faithful at the Holborn Circus
(turned for the nonce into a conventicle), a good story is told of “a keen
encounter of the wits” between the ex-pugilist and a noble lord who met
the preacher in a West-end thoroughfare. After a mutual stare of surprised
recognition, his lordship inquired, glancing at Bendy’s parsonic “get-up,”
what might be his “little game” now. As befitted his new vocation,
the solemn reply was, “Truly, my lord, I am now fighting Satan&mdash;&#8203;and
behold the victory shall be mine.” “I hope so, Bendy,” rejoined his lordship,
“but pray fight Beelzebub more fairly than you did Ben Caunt, or I may
change my side.”</p>

<p>A final word on the much-disputed nickname of Bendigo. Of course,
as people generally invent some plausible meaning or derivation for a word
they do not comprehend, we were told (first, I believe, by an Australian
paper) that “Bendigo was the name given to an English prizefighter from
his <em>bending as he went in to fight</em>. Hence called Bend-I-go.” Prodigious
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pageno">45</span>
etymologist! We never saw any such <em>bend</em> in Bend-i-go, or any other
pugilist, though we have heard of “a Grecian bend” in a lady.</p>

<p>William Thompson was, as we have already noted, one of three boys at
a birth, and these, among people irreverently familiar with the use of
Scripture names, were called (though not at the baptismal font), Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego. A curious confirmation of this is now before us
in our hero’s first challenge, in <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, in 1835, wherein he styles himself
“Abednego, of Nottingham.” Yet ever afterwards that journal prints the
popular vernacular corruption of “Bendigo.” In this matter of Abednego
do we not find&mdash;</p>

<p>The Abednego of Nottingham, who nearly half a century ago was “ready
to meet any 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> man,” is now, in 1880, “articled” to floor the “Prince of
Darkness” himself, who&mdash;&#8203;we have Shakespeare’s word for it&mdash;&#8203;is every inch
“a gentleman.”</p>

<p>Thus far had we penned our memoir of the eccentric pugilistic preacher,
when an <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">annonce</span> in the London journals informed the public, that on
Monday, the 23rd of August, William Thompson (alias Bendigo) had died
at Beeston, near Nottingham, in the 69th year of his age. His death was
the result of an accident, he having fallen downstairs at his own house, and
fractured three of his ribs, a bony splinter perforating the lung. Poor
Bendy, as we have already stated, was always fond of acrobatic tricks. A
severe accident some years since while playing at quoits, a broken knee-cap,
which permanently shortened his right leg, and, subsequently, a serious
injury to his head, while in pursuit of “the contemplative man’s recreation,”
bear witness that his talent for knocking a man about extended to his own
person. In all probability, but for these untoward mischances, “the Bold
Bendigo” might have added another to the many Champions of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>
who have exceeded the Psalmist’s limit of “three score years and ten.”</p>

</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Benjamin Caunt</span>, like his noted opponent Bendigo, was a native of
Nottinghamshire. He was born on the 22nd of March, 1815, at the
village of Hucknall Torkard, his parents being tenants of Lord Byron, the
poet, a fact of which the huge, unsentimental Ben in after-life was fond of
boasting. His father having been engaged in some humble capacity at
Newstead, Ben had some traditions of the wayward genius, more or less
apocryphal. According to his own account (he was certainly a first-rate
shot) his earliest employment was as gamekeeper or watcher; his Nottingham
opponents insisted on his having been a “navvy.” His size and strength
might well fit him for either occupation, his height being 6<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> 2½<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr>, and
his weight 14<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr></p>

<p>Caunt appears at an early age to have aspired to pugilistic honours, and
acquired some local reputation by being victor in a couple of battles, of
which, however, we have no reliable details. His first recorded contest is,
therefore, his encounter with William Thompson, of Nottingham, on the
21st July, 1835, near Appleby House, Notts, when he had just completed
his twentieth year, wherein he was defeated by the greater experience,
shifty tactics, and superior boxing skill of the afterwards famous Bendigo.
(See <span class="sc">Bendigo</span>, <abbr title="Chapter One">Chap. I.</abbr>, <a href="#Page_6">page 6</a>, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span>.)</p>

<p>Caunt’s next appearance within the ropes was attended with better fortune.
On the 17th August, 1837, he met and defeated a local celebrity,
William Butler, at Stoneyford, Notts, in fourteen rounds, for a stake of £20
a side. In this battle his opponent, a 12-stone man, was beaten by weight,
strength, and resolute, though by no means scientific, fighting.
</p>
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pageno">48</span>

<p>In like manner Boneford, a big one, was polished off in six rounds by
“Young Ben,” at Sunrise Hill, Notts, in November of the same year.</p>

<p>In the interval his former opponent had been rapidly rising in fistic fame.
He had defeated Brassey, of Bradford (May 24th, 1836), Young
Langan, of Liverpool (January 24th, 1837), and Bill Looney, another
big one (June 13th, 1837).</p>

<p>These exploits could not fail to attract public attention, and the
patrons of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P. R.</abbr> were anxious to bring the antagonists together once
again, an anxiety fully shared by Caunt and Bendigo themselves.</p>

<p>“Where there’s a will there’s a way,” so in this case preliminaries were
arranged with much greater facility than in after-times. The stakes were
posted to £100 on each side, and the day, Monday, April 3rd, 1838, fixed for
the encounter, the field of battle to be in the neighbourhood of Doncaster.</p>

<p>As a record of times and manners, and modes of travel, we shall give a
sketch of how and in what company the representative of <cite>Bell’s Life in
London</cite>, then, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">quâ</span> the Ring, the only sporting “oracle,” was wont to make his
way to distant battlefields, ere the steam steed had rendered the mail coach,
the “Highflyer,” the “Red Rover,” the “Age,” <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">et hoc genus omne</span>, obsolete
as public conveyances:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">As “Sheffield, or within 100 miles thereof,” was the mysterious “fixture”
for the big tourney, on Saturday evening, at half-past seven, we threw ourselves
into the Glasgow mail, on our route to Doncaster, between which
town and Selby we had the “office” the affair was to be decided. Adventures
in stage-coaches have often afforded topics for amusing detail; but we
confess, from the laborious duties which fall to our lot to perform, private
as well as public, every week of our lives, the last day, or rather the last night,
of the week is not the one we should select as that most propitious to collect
materials (if such materials were wanting) for filling a column in our
ensuing publication. In taking our place in the mail, therefore, we looked
forward rather to the enjoyment of an occasional snooze than to the hope
that we should discover any subject on which to dilate at a future period,
whether as to the character of our fellow-travellers, the general appointments
of the “drag,” or the peculiarities of the coachmen or guards&mdash;&#8203;of
the former we had four, and of the latter two, in the course of the journey&mdash;&#8203;and
these we will at once dismiss, by stating, at the outset, that they did
their duty admirably&mdash;&#8203;taking care, as “in duty bound,” to seek the usual
mark of approbation by farewell hints in the common-place terms of “<em>I
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pageno">49</span>
leave you here, gentlemen</em>”&mdash;&#8203;in other words, “<em>tip</em>” and “<em>go</em>”&mdash;&#8203;a laconic mode of
address which by all travellers is well understood, however coolly appreciated
when spoken at an open door on a cold frosty night, as that night of
Saturday was, and at a moment when you may perhaps have been dreaming
of the “joys you left behind you.” Quietness and repose being our first
study, we soon placed our hat in the suspending-straps at the top of the
mail, and our travelling-cap over head, and then, quietly reclining in the
corner with our back to the horses, waited for the “start” from the yard
of the “Bull and Mouth.” We found one old gentleman had taken his
seat before us, who subsequently followed our example in taking the same
side of the coach with ourselves, and was not less careful in guarding himself
against the chilling influence of a hard frost. A third gentleman soon
after joined us, and thus, “<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">trio juncta in uno</span>,” we were whirled round to
the Post Office, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s-le-Grand, whence we shortly commenced
our journey at a slapping pace. On reaching Islington, a fourth passenger,
of colossal size, filled up the vacant seat. Few words, if any, were spoken;
and the only interruption to the monotony of the night’s travel was the
frequent popping out and in of the last-mentioned gentleman to comfort his
“inward man” with “drops of brandy,” with which he so perfumed our
“leathern convenience” on his return that if we were as sensitive as some
Frenchman of whom we have heard (who dined upon the effluvia of the
good things he could not otherwise enjoy) we should certainly have been
“pretty jolly” before he took his leave of us at peep of day. His departure
gave occasion for the first indication that our companions were
gifted with the power of speech. Their words were few, and these only
had reference to the “spirited” propensities of the gentleman who had just
vacated his seat. On this there could be no difference of opinion, and consequently
no argument&mdash;&#8203;so that we soon relapsed into the appearance at
least of sleep, which we maintained with great perseverance till a brilliant
sun shining through the ice-covered windows called forth a remark on the
fineness of the morning. This, to our surprise, for we thought ourselves
<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">incog.</span>, was followed by a remark of recognition from the third gentleman
who had entered the coach at the “Bull and Mouth,” and who, alluding to
quick travelling, recalled to our mind some feats of this sort in which we
had been engaged in the course of a twenty years’ connection with the Press.
The ice once broken, conversation commenced, with apparent satisfaction to
us all, the venerable gentleman on my right joining, and contributing as well as
exacting his proportion of information on all manner of topics&mdash;&#8203;public men
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pageno">50</span>
and public measures, and the public Press, forming prominent subjects of
remark, upon all of which our friend on the right seemed agreeably conversant.
We soon discovered that our opposite neighbour was going to
Leeds, to and from which town he was a frequent traveller; but respecting
the other we could form no opinion. Regarding ourselves our secret had
been divulged, and we stood forward the confessed “representative of
<cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>.” Sporting of various descriptions opened new sources
of gossip, and here we found “the unknown” as much at home as ourselves.
It came out, in fact, that he had been a breeder of racehorses, and a
patron of the Turf for pleasure, but not for profit&mdash;&#8203;that he had been
steward at Newmarket, and that, in fact, he knew all the leading Turfites of
the age, and was familiar with all the recent important events on the Turf.
All this led us to surmise that he was “somebody,” but who, we confess, we
did not attempt to speculate. We found him a most pleasant associate, and
with that we were content. Upon the subject of our own trip to Doncaster
we were silent, for we considered that was “nothing to nobody.” The Ring
as connected with our British sports was but slightly alluded to&mdash;&#8203;and
against the objections that were made arising out of the late fatal issue of the
combat between Swift and Brighton Bill, we argued it was a casualty purely
the result of an accident, which might have occurred on any other athletic
competition in which no personal animosity existed, and wound up by
saying that there was one unanswerable argument even to the opponents
of prizefighting, that as by them the principals were invariably considered
worthless and deserving of punishment, in becoming the instrument of
punishing each other, they were only fulfilling the ends of justice, without
the necessity of legal interference. We referred, of course, to the
recent painful exhibition of the frequent use of the <em>knife</em>, and the strong
remarks which the increasing extent of this treacherous mode of revenge
had called from the judges; but upon these points our unknown friend, as
we take the liberty of calling him, did not seem disposed to break a lance,
and the subject dropped. At last we reached Grantham, where our fellow-travellers
forewarned us we should have an excellent breakfast, and certainly
one served in better taste or in greater profusion we never enjoyed.
Here we met in the same room the Quaker member for Durham (Mr.
Pease), on his way to the north, between whom and “the unknown” there
was a friendly recognition, but we still made no effort to lift the veil by
which he was enshrouded. On again taking our seats in the mail, we were
alone with the old gentleman, our Leeds friend having mounted the roof,
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pageno">51</span>
so that we had it all to ourselves. The chat was as pleasant to us as
before&mdash;&#8203;new topics were broached, and the description of the localities
through which we passed&mdash;&#8203;the “Dukery” (a sort of concentration of ducal
seats), &amp;c.&mdash;&#8203;afforded us both amusement and information. Now, for the first
time, when conversation flagged, on watching the physiognomy of “the
unknown,” we imagined there was a meaning smile on his countenance,
which seemed to say, “This fellow does not know to whom he is talking,”
and we confess we began to try back and see whether we had said anything
to which exception could be taken; and more especially whether anything
had dropped from us whence the intent of our journey could be collected;
for we began to suspect we had been talking to a <em>beak</em>, who
was going down expressly to spoil sport, and who was chuckling within
himself at the disappointment we were sure to incur. But all was safe&mdash;&#8203;we
had kept our secret, and from anything that had dropped from us everything
was as “right as the day;” indeed we dismissed the thought of
treachery from our mind, and we are now glad we did so, for it would have
been most unjustly adopted; for, although a <em>beak</em> of the first magnitude was
in truth before us, we are persuaded he had no sinister feeling towards us or
the sport we anticipated. But we have spun our yarn longer than we had
intended, and will come to the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</span> at once. We now rattled into
the clean and quiet town of Doncaster with the customary flourish of the
horn, and reached the “Angel” safe and sound. As we had collected
that our companion was going no further, we were satisfied our doubts as to
his real character would soon be removed; they were, sooner than we
expected; for scarcely had he stepped forth when “<span class="sc">My lord!</span>” was congratulated
on his safe arrival. My lord! thought we, and following his
example, our first effort on stretching our cramped limbs was by a respectful
touch of our <em>tile</em> to acknowledge the honour we had enjoyed&mdash;&#8203;an honour,
by-the-bye, which confirmed us in the good old maxim, “Where ignorance
is bliss ’tis folly to be wise.” An answer to a simple question soon put us
in possession of the “great secret.” It was to a noble Baron who was
about to preside at the Pontefract sessions we were indebted for a pleasing
relief to a tedious journey; and while we acknowledge his lordship’s kindness
and urbanity, permit us to add that there was not a sentiment uttered by
him in our presence to which we do not heartily respond. We are sure it
will be gratifying to our <em>milling</em> readers to hear that although the fight
which has given occasion for this episode was announced to take
place in the district of Pontefract, formerly represented by a <em>milling</em>
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">52</span>
member,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span>
neither our noble companion nor any of his sessional coadjutors
offered any interference.</p>

<p>At Doncaster we had our “<span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout</span>” (we hope he will excuse the use of a
professional title), for whom we immediately sent, but he was profoundly
ignorant of the all-important place of rendezvous&mdash;&#8203;a fact at which we
rejoiced, as it was clear the necessary secrecy had been observed. However
quiet at Doncaster, at Sheffield, Nottingham, and all the surrounding
towns, even to Manchester and Liverpool, all was bustle and commotion.
The Fancy, of all degrees, were on the alert, and the roads, on Sunday
evening, leading to Doncaster, were thronged, not only with pedestrians,
including no small proportion of “hard-ups,” but with vehicles of every
imaginable description&mdash;&#8203;flies, phaetons, gigs, and fish-carts, all laden to
dangerous excess, and with a perfect disregard to the qualities of the horses
engaged in the service; it seeming to be an admitted principle that on such
occasions the <em>tits</em> were not only “warranted sound and free from vice,” but
masters of any indefinite proportion of weight. As Doncaster was the
grand <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débouche</span> through which the cavalcade must necessarily pass towards
the “fixture,” the innocent inhabitants were soon enlightened respecting
the approach of some extraordinary event, the character of which was
quickly divulged. The whole night long the rattle of wheels, the pattering
of horses’ feet, and the shouts of the anxious throng, proclaimed the interest
which was felt, and the wild spirit which was abroad. “The Selby road!”
was the cry; and on crossing the Don, at the foot of the town, a short turn
to the right threw the nags into the right direction, to the no small gratification
of the collector at the turnpike gate, although rather to the discomfiture
of many who had the “bobs” to “fork out;” but fights are of
rare occurrence nowadays, and for such a luxury expense is no
object.</p>

<p>Askerne, or Askeron, a neat little village seven miles from Doncaster,
on the Selby road, celebrated for its sulphurous spring&mdash;&#8203;which rises from a
fine piece of water called Askerne Pool, and which is much visited by
patients afflicted with rheumatism and other diseases&mdash;&#8203;was the first grand
halting-place, and here, at the “White Swan,” had Bendigo, under the
<span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">surveillance</span> of Peter Taylor, of Liverpool, taken up his abode. In and
about this house an immense multitude had assembled. Caunt had travelled
further afield, and at the “Hawke Arms,” a new inn about two miles further,
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">53</span>
had pitched his tent, attended by young Molyneaux, the black, his
honoured parent, and divers other staunch and sturdy friends. The ring
was formed in a field a short distance from the road, about half way
between the “Swan” and the “Hawke,” by the Liverpool Commissary,
and all looked well. Soon after ten o’clock we made our appearance at the
“Swan” in a post-chaise, and drove up to the motley group in front of the
house. Our appearance was no doubt suspicious, and from the scowling
looks of some of the “hard-ups” with whose private signs we were unacquainted,
we were evidently regarded with more fear than affection. At
last, recollecting that we had seen Izzy Lazarus down the road, and knowing
that he is regularly installed as a publican in Sheffield, we asked for
him, in order that he might be our cicerone to his friends. The “poy”
soon made his appearance, being a full stone heavier than when he left
town, and recognising us, he made known the agreeable intelligence that
“’twas t’editor of Bell’s Loife in Lunnon”&mdash;&#8203;an announcement so unexpected,
and apparently so agreeable, that when we descended from our trap
we verily believe the sudden appearance of a hippopotamus would not have
excited more astonishment. “What,” cried one, “is that t’editor of Bell’s
Loife? Well, I’m dom’d if I didn’t take un for a gentleman!”&mdash;&#8203;while another
declared he “thought it were summat worse, for he took un for a <em>beak</em>, or
summat o’ that koind.” Our opinion was not asked as to our notions of
these critics; but certainly had we been put to our oath we should have
said they were some of the “unwashed from the Hardware Country,” who
had come thus far to perform their ablutions in the Pool of Askerne&mdash;&#8203;a
ceremony which the dust of the roads, and the hasty manner in which
they had performed their toilets preparatory to their “stopping up all
night to be up early in the morning,” rendered requisite.</p>

<p>We did not wait to bandy civilities, but proceeded direct to the dormitory
of Bendigo, whom we found, like a bacon sandwich, comfortably encased
between two slices of flannel, vulgarly called blankets. It was the
first time we had the honour of an interview, and we made our salaam with
due reverence, while the object of our embassy was duly announced by
Peter Taylor. Bendigo appeared uncommonly well, and was in high
spirits. He is a rough, handy-looking fellow, very muscular, and as we
were informed weighed but 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> His seconds, we were informed,
were to be Taylor and Nick Ward, and, judging from his manner, he seemed
to have booked victory as already secure. To all present we enjoined the
expediency of getting early into the ring, as there was a gentle whisper
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pageno">54</span>
before we left Doncaster that the constables were on the alert. From the
“Swan” we proceeded to the “Hawke,” where our presence was not
less a matter of surprise. We soon obtained an introduction to Caunt,
who was assuming his fighting costume. He expressed his joy at seeing
us, but proceeded <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span> with the adornment of his person. His
father sat by his side, and if having a gigantic son is a source of pride he
has sufficient to render him doubly so, for the hero of the day proved to be
a fine young fellow, two-and-twenty years of age, standing six feet three
inches in height, and weighing fifteen stone and a half, apparently active,
strong, and full of confidence. Comparing him with Bendigo, it was a
camelopard to a nylghau; and yet Bendigo was the favourite at five and
six to four&mdash;&#8203;a state of odds which seemed unaccountable when the disparity
in size was considered. Having here also urged the wisdom of taking
time by the forelock, we returned towards the ring, which by this time
was surrounded by a most numerous and heterogeneous crowd, many of
whom carried sticks of enormous size, and presented aspects which to eyes
polite would have been far from inviting. We knew, however, that
“rough cases often cover good cutlery,” and we were not disposed to
form our opinion from the outside alone, and more especially when we were
aware that many of these hardy ones had toddled the whole way from
Sheffield or Nottingham, or places equally distant, to witness the prowess of
their favourite champion.</p>

<p>The adage of “the cup and the lip” was in this case, as in many others
before, again illustrated, for just as we were about to enter the field some
half-dozen horsemen rode up, and in an authoritative manner forbade,
not the banns, but the fight, in terms, however, so persuasive and
agreeable that it was impossible to be angry: in fact, there were so many
doubtful-looking sticks performing evolutions in the air, and so many grim
visages watching those evolutions, that their worships (and they proved to
be veritable J.P.’s, attended by a posse of constables well mounted)
evidently thought that the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">suaviter in modo</span> was the safest game, and
therefore, while they indicated their determination to preserve the peace,
they assured the mobocracy they would not do more, provided the
combatants “mizzled out of the West Riding.” Some were for bidding
defiance to legal authority so weakly supported, but Jem Ward, who now
came up, assured their <em>beakships</em> that due respect should be paid to their
behests, and with this assurance a mutual feeling of confidence was
established.
</p>
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pageno">55</span>

<p>The men were now in their respective carriages in the main road,
waiting for the “office,” when Jem Ward, who assumed the friendly
character of director, after consulting with persons well acquainted with
the localities, determined that the next move should be to Hatfield, about
seven miles distant, and within a short run of Lincolnshire. This he
publicly declared to be the final resolve, and, sending a horseman to the
Commissary and the men, started forthwith for his destination, to prepare
a suitable and unobjectionable spot. He was attended by Young Langan,
who carried Bendigo’s fighting-shoes, Hackett, who was to have been
Caunt’s second, and a numerous cavalcade of charioteers and horsemen,
who reached the “Bell” at Hatfield in quick time. Had his arrangement
been adopted all would have gone off well, but unfortunately there
were too many masters and too little of system. A new leader sprang
up in the person of Grear, the sporting sweep of Selby, who, being
perfectly well acquainted with the localities of the country, as well as
anxious to take the fight nearer his own quarters, led the way towards
Selby, followed by a prodigious crowd, and, from some misunderstanding,
by the combatants in their carriages. The new commander gave hopes
that the ring might be formed before they reached the Ouse, which
divides the West from the East Riding, but although several attempts
were made it was no go, for the constables kept up with the vanguard,
and the passage across the Ouse became indispensable, many of the company
in the rear&mdash;&#8203;horse and foot as well as charioteers&mdash;&#8203;falling off dead
beat. Those who were able to keep up their steam, however, crossed the
bridge over the Ouse into Selby pell-mell, to the no small astonishment of
the inhabitants, and the crowds of market people who were assembled
with their wares. One old lady, almost petrified at such a sudden incursion,
in great agitation inquired what had brought so many “gentlemen”
into the East Riding. “Oh,” said a wag, “there’s a rebellion in the
West, and we’re all driven over the river.” “Lord help me,” cried the
old lady, “I live at Ricall, and ye’ll eat us all up!”</p>

<p>Grear, undismayed, pushed on, and knowing every inch of the country,
did not halt till he got nearly four miles beyond Selby, when he turned
down a romantic lane to the left, opposite Skipworth Common, and in a
large field a few removes from the main road, near the bank of the river,
the ring was, with great labour, formed; and the crowd, which had
received fresh accessions from the town of Selby and surrounding country,
collected round it. There were but few of the original followers able to
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pageno">56</span>
reach this distant point, and thousands were thus deprived of the object of
their long and wearisome journey, as well as dissatisfied with a move
which, had Ward’s directions been obeyed, would have brought them
nearer home, with a more certain chance of proceeding to business
without interruption.</p>

<p>“What cannot be cured must be endured;” and Ward, as well as
his unfortunate companions, had only to console themselves with the cold
consolation of having been made “April fools.” Among others to whom
the change was productive of unforeseen enjoyment were several members
of the Badsworth Hunt, who came up in scarlet, headed by Captain B.,
one of the right sort, who backed Bendigo at six to four, with a well-known
sporting whip, “wot drives the London mail,” and whose mackintosh
cape formed no disagreeable recommendation to the Captain, by
whom it was borrowed at “shent. per shent.” interest. Having taken
breath, all prepared for action, and the ring was beaten out with as much
effect as so sudden and unceremonious an assemblage would permit. The
men entered the ring about half-past four o’clock, Bendigo taking the
lead, attended by Peter Taylor and Nick Ward; he was in high spirits,
but on calling for his spiked shoes, it was “all my eye,” for they had unfortunately
been sent on to Hatfield, and thus he had the disadvantage of
adopting less suitable “crab-shells,” a circumstance which did not seem,
however, to disturb his equanimity. Caunt then came forward, waited
upon by Young Molyneaux and Gregson. On <em>peeling</em>, as we have before
stated, their condition seemed admirable, and the flush of expected victory
animated their “dials.” Two umpires and a referee having been chosen,
all was ready, and then commenced</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On setting to, the gigantic size
of Caunt, as he stood over his antagonist,
excited general surprise, and, as a natural
result in such disparities, produced a feeling
of sympathy towards the smaller man; but
Bendigo displayed perfect self-possession,
and commenced manœuvring without delay.
He dodged backward and forward several
times, with a view of drawing his man, having
his right ready for a fly as he came in, but
Caunt was not to be had at that game&mdash;&#8203;when
Bendigo, making a feint with his right, let
go his left and caught him a tidy smack on
the left ogle. Caunt instantly closed, and
a struggle ensued, in which the superior
strength of the “big one” was sufficiently
apparent, and Bendigo, finding he had no
chance at this work, went down.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt was now on his mettle, and on
coming to the scratch went straight in to his
work, hitting out left and right; Bendigo
got away, but napped a nasty one or two.
Steadying himself he caught Caunt a crack
on the side of his head with his left. Caunt
did not choose to stand these pops, but rushing
after his shifty antagonist, caught him
in his arms, and threw him after a short
struggle.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Both men came up steady, with no
great harm done. Bendigo again pursued
the dodging system, and, after a little in-and-out
work he succeeded in planting his left
on Caunt’s “’tato trap,” and drew <em>first blood</em>.
Caunt felt indignant at this liberty, rushed
to his man, literally lifted him up in his
arms, and forcing him against the stake,
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pageno">57</span>
gave him such a hug that, after a severe
struggle, he got down, Caunt falling heavily
upon him.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo showed symptoms of distress
from the Bruin’s hug he had received in the
last round, but, keeping at a distance till he
had recovered his wind, he became as lively
as ever. After some time devoted to sparring,
Bendigo, evidently having no desire to get
within grasp of his man, let fly with his
right, but did not get home. A little more
time being devoted to play, Caunt let fly
left and right, but his blows did not tell.
Bendigo, on the get-away system, at last
brought himself to a steady point, and
caught Caunt a tremendous crack on the
cheek, which opened “mouth the second,”
and drew claret in abundance. Caunt instantly
rushed to work; a severe rally
followed, in which several hits, left and right,
were exchanged. In the close Caunt again
had it all his own way, and in the end threw
Bendigo and fell on him. When both men
were picked up it was seen that their nobs
had been considerably damaged; Caunt bled
profusely from his nose and a cut under his
left eye, while the side of Bendigo’s pimple
was swollen from a visitation from Caunt’s
right, but their seconds soon brought them
in “apple-pie order,” and they were ready
when “time” was called.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;After some sparring, Caunt, who took
a distaste to Bendigo’s system of popping
and shifting, went in right and left, and at
once closing, seized his man as if in a vice,
holding him on the ropes till nearly strangled,
amidst cries of “Shame!” After a
violent struggle by Bendigo to get away, he
was at last thrown; Caunt fell heavily on
him.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;From this to the 11th round the
fighting was very quick on both sides, Caunt
leading off left and right, Bendigo meeting
him as he came in with severe jobs, and
then getting down to avoid&mdash;&#8203;a shifty mode of
fighting, far from agreeable to the spectator,
but rendered almost indispensable from the
great inequality in the size of the men. In
the closes Bendigo had not a chance, but his
pops at Caunt as he rushed to the charge
told dreadfully on his head, which he gave
to get what he expected to be a home hit
on his adversary, but in which he was nearly
every time disappointed.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Both as fresh and ready as ever&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo,
from his generalship the favourite;
still Caunt was bold as a lion. Bendigo
now changed his system, and finding he
often missed the “head-rails” of his opponent,
he commenced peppering right and
left at the body, the whacks sounding like
the music of a big drum. Cries of “Go in,
Bendigo!” at length induced him to get
closer to his man, and he popped in a stinger
with his left under the right eye. Caunt
instantly closed, and a violent struggle for
the fall succeeded, when both fell.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Bendigo led off well with his left;
but Caunt was for close work, and rushing
to his man, hit right and left, and grappled,
when, catching Bendigo in his arms, he
carried him to the ropes, and there held him
with such force as almost to deprive him of
the power of motion. The spectators, disgusted
at this mode of fighting, cried out
“Shame!” and exclaimed, “Thou big ugly
twoad, dost thou call that foighting? whoy,
the little ’un would lick thee and two or
three more such if thee’d foight.” Caunt
was not, however, disposed to listen to
these hints, and stuck to his man like wax,
till at last fears were entertained that Bendigo
would be strangled, and a cry of “Cut
the ropes!” burst from all directions. This
suggestion was adopted, and the ropes were
instantly cut in two places, when down
went both, Caunt uppermost. The mob
then rushed to the stakes, and the most
dreadful confusion followed&mdash;&#8203;umpire and
referee and all forced into a dense mass.
Still the interior of the ring was preserved,
and cleared, and an attempt was made to
repair the ropes.</p>

<p>     From the 14th to the 38th round the
greatest confusion prevailed. Bendigo persevered
in his getting-down system after he
received the charge of Caunt, and popped
him in return; he had had enough of
Caunt’s embraces, and studiously avoided
them.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>During this portion of the battle a magistrate made his appearance, if
possible to put an end to hostilities, but he was “baying the moon,” and
he was forced to retire, no doubt feeling that amidst such a scene the
dignity of his office would not be properly vindicated. About the 50th
round a wrangle arose from an allegation that Bendigo had kicked Caunt
as he lay on the ground. Caunt claimed the fight. An appeal was made
to the referee, who declared he saw nothing that was avoidable, and
the fight proceeded up to the 75th round, during all which time the crush
was overwhelming. Bendigo’s hitting was terrific, but still Caunt was
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pageno">58</span>
game to the backbone, and although heavily punished, fought with him,
and when he caught him gave him the advantage of his “Cornish hug.”
Both men were alternately distressed, but the powerful hitting of Bendigo
made him a decided favourite; in fact, he showed but little appearance of
injury, although he had received some heavy body hits, and was somewhat
exhausted by Caunt’s hugging and hanging upon him; still he rallied, and
was well on his legs.</p>

<p>In the last round, on “time” being called, both men came ready to the
scratch; when Caunt prepared for his rush, Bendigo slipped back, and fell
on his nether end, “without a blow.” This all his friends ascribed to a
slip, but Molyneaux, the second of Caunt, cried “Foul!” and claimed the
battle, evidently anxious to save his man from the “fire.” An appeal was
immediately made to the referee, who seemed to be a stranger to the laws
of the Ring; and on being enlightened as to the fact of “going down
without a blow” being deemed “foul,” he decided that Bendigo had so
gone down, on which Molyneaux instantaneously threw up his hat and
claimed the battle.</p>

<p>An indescribable row followed, the friends of Bendigo declaring he had
gone down from accident, owing to his substitute shoes being without
spikes. Bendigo was indignant, and ready to fight, but it was all U.P.
Wharton would not throw a chance away, and took his man out of the
ring, while Bendigo seized the colours, and in turn claimed a win.</p>

<p>The scene that followed beggars description. Caunt, who was conveyed
to his carriage, was brought out to renew the fight; but this he declined,
and being placed on a horse, he was pulled off, and but for the protection
of his friends would have been roughly handled. He had to walk to
Selby, whence he was conveyed back to the “Hawke Arms,” where
his wounds were dressed and every attention paid him. He was dreadfully
punished, but still strong and vigorous.</p>

<p>The fight lasted one hour and twenty minutes.</p>

<p>No sooner had the astute “Morocco Prince” snatched his verdict, and
got his man away, as he was entitled to do, than we discovered, on reentering
the ring&mdash;&#8203;from which we had been glad to retire during the disgraceful
disorder that followed the appeal&mdash;&#8203;that the umpires had never
been asked if they differed as to the “foul” at all; in fact, Bendy’s umpire
declared he had been separated from the referee and shut out of the ring in
the confusion, so that the issue depended upon the judgment of the referee,
who, in such an uproar, added to his inexperience, had indeed a most difficult
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pageno">59</span>
duty to fulfil. Of course, according to the then new practice, a
lawyer’s letter was immediately posted to the stakeholder warning him not
to part with the stakes until the matter had been thoroughly sifted, as both
parties claimed them.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that Bendigo, in the course of this battle, exhibited
extraordinary powers of punishment; his hits were terrific, as Caunt’s
condition after the battle testified, his head and body being dreadfully
shattered, but still, from the specimen thus afforded, we should not regard
Bendigo as a fair stand-up fighter; he was shifty, and too much on the
get-away-and-get-down system. With Caunt, however, it must be admitted
there was every excuse for this course, for with four stone extra to cope
with in weight, and six inches in height, it required no common nerve and
caution to escape annihilation. Caunt, who claims the “Championship,”
is anything but a well-scienced man; he hits at random, and has no idea
of self-defence. His great attributes are game and strength, which he
possesses in a pre-eminent degree. Throughout the fight there was not a
single knock-down blow, which, when Caunt’s length and weight are considered,
is the strongest evidence that the big one lacked the gift of hitting
at points, or, as John Jackson expressed it, “judging time and distance
accurately.” When we look back at the recorded battles of Mendoza,
Jackson, Dutch Sam, Gully, and Randall, and remember the fights of
Spring, Crawley, and Jem Ward, the pretensions of Caunt to the Championship
must point the moral of the Ring’s decline. Pulling, hauling,
squeezing, and hugging, the grand offensive manœuvres of Big Ben’s style
of boxing, would have been scouted as a disgrace to all but pitmen, navvies,
and provincial “roughs.”</p>

<p>Bendigo, after the battle, proceeded to Selby, where he remained for the
night. He appeared little the worse for the encounter, so far as hitting
was concerned. The only marks of punishment were a flush under the
right eye, a swelling under the left ear, some marks of hits on the lower
part of the right shoulder-blade, and sundry excoriations and abrasions of
the cuticle, bearing full evidence of the severe squeezing and scrapings on
the ropes inflicted by the Bruin-like hugs of his huge antagonist. To us
Bendigo expressed his readiness to meet his giant opponent “anywhere,
anyhow, on any terms&mdash;&#8203;to-morrow, next week, or next month, anything to
accommodate the big chucklehead”&mdash;&#8203;which, as we afterwards knew, was
Bendy’s uncomplimentary but characteristic epithet, not only in speaking
of, but in personally addressing, his gigantic rival.
</p>
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pageno">60</span>

<p>Much correspondence of the “’fending and proving” order followed
this debateable conclusion. Mr. Lockwood, the referee, however, declared
his adherence to his “decision that Bendigo went down without a blow,” and
thereupon the stakeholder handed over the battle money to Caunt, with the
observation:&mdash;&#8203;“The referee’s decision must be upheld, and if in his judgment
Bendigo went down (he says, ‘in fact, fell to avoid’), then, whatever might
have been his chances&mdash;&#8203;and it is admitted he had the best of the battle&mdash;&#8203;Caunt
is entitled to the stakes, and <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tem.</span> to the title of ‘Champion.’”
The next week Bendy was as good as his word, for articles were entered
into for a third meeting, for £100 a side, to come off on the 30th of July;
but when £40 a side had been deposited, a forfeit took place, under the
following circumstances:&mdash;</p>

<p>The “Deaf ’un,” as Jem Burke was usually called, had returned from
America, in the height of his popularity, and his challenges to “any man in
or out of England,” especially “Mister Bendy,” proved too strong a “red
herring” across the trail for the Nottingham hero to resist, so he forfeited
£40 cash down, to grasp at what proved, for a time, a fleeting shadow,
as the Deaf ’un, after his challenge and its acceptance, went on a Parisian
tour (see the Life of <span class="sc">Bendigo</span>, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span>, <a href="#Page_12"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 12</a>); and it was not until Shrove
Tuesday (Feb. 12th), 1839, that Bendigo and Burke had their “cock-shy,”
at Appleby, and Bendigo thereafter received a much disputed “belt” from
Jem Ward at Liverpool.</p>

<p>The remainder of 1838, and the whole of 1839, passed without Caunt
sporting his colours in the lists. In August, 1840, we find our old friend
Ned Painter, at Norwich, and honest fat Peter Crawley, in London, made
the channels of the challenges of Brassey and of Caunt. Ned Painter
writes thus, on the last day of July:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p>“<span class="sc">Mr. Editor</span>,&mdash;&#8203;In answer to an observation made in last week’s paper, that ‘providing
Brassey’s friends will sustain their promises,’ allow me to say that ‘corn,’ not ‘chaff,’ is the
answer of Brassey to Caunt. Brassey went to Liverpool to make the match with Hampson;
when he arrived there neither man nor money was to be seen. When Caunt challenged the
whole world, Brassey and his friends accepted the challenge, and to meet Caunt’s wish, sent
£25 to Tom Spring a week previous to the day appointed. I went myself on the very day,
but Caunt and his party were invisible. If Caunt means a fight, and not a farce, he must go
to Leeds or come to Norwich, and match at his own expense this time, as neither Brassey
nor myself were allowed even the £2 for expenses promised. I am, Mr. Editor, for work,
not mere words or wind.</p>
<p class="flushright">“NED PAINTER.</p>

</div><!--end letter-->

<p>To which Peter Crawley thus practically replied on behalf of Caunt:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p>“<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;&#8203;My having placed £25 in your hands will, I hope, remove all doubt as regards
Caunt’s money being ready; and it remains with the friends of Brassey alone to appoint a

meet at my house, to draw up articles and put down their dust; and unless this be attended
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pageno">61</span>
to, for my part I shall consider they do not mean business. I have taken the responsibility
on myself of detaining the money a little longer; that would give Brassey time to
join his friends at Norwich, which, I understand, is all that prevents the match being made
now.</p>

</div><!--end letter-->

<p>All difficulties were now smoothed, and a match for £100 a side was
made, to be decided on the 26th October, 1840. As the deposits were made
good, and the day approached, the interest in sporting circles rose to an
intense height, and at the last deposit Tom Spring’s “Castle” was literally
stormed by eager crowds.</p>

<p>Six Mile Bottom, Cambridgeshire, distinguished in former times by the
contests of dons of the olden school, under the patronage of men of the
highest rank in the kingdom, was named. Although inferior in stamp and
action to bygone heroes, the present competitors were not less great in
their own estimation, and certainly quite as great in bulk&mdash;&#8203;for Caunt stood
6<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> 2<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr>, and weighed 14<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, and Brassey, two inches shorter, weighed
12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 1<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> (a standard which, according to the best judges, is sufficient for all
useful purposes in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P. R.</abbr>, all beyond that being deemed surplusage).
In point of age they were pretty much upon a par, and in the prime of
life, Caunt having been born in March, 1815, and Brassey in the month
of January in the same year.</p>

<p>The opinion of Bendigo as to the merits of the two men was naturally
sought, and he, without hesitation, gave the “palm” to Brassey, whom he
pronounced the better tactician, if not the gamer man. As provincial
champions they were held in high estimation&mdash;&#8203;Brassey at Leeds, Bradford,
and those districts, and Caunt at Nottingham, Sheffield, and the surrounding
country. In London, however, their pretensions as scientific men were
viewed with little favour&mdash;&#8203;and, in fact, in that respect their acquirements
were but of an inferior character&mdash;&#8203;as their sparring displays with the
accomplished Tom Spring sufficiently demonstrated. Still, although
“rough,” they were deemed “ready,” and a slashing fight was anticipated.</p>

<p>Brassey went into training under the auspices of Ned Painter, of Norwich,
and Caunt claimed the attention of “the Infant” (Peter Crawley),
by whom he was placed “at nurse” in the neighbourhood of Hatfield.
More competent mentors could not have been selected; and all that judgment
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pageno">63</span>
and good advice could effect was accomplished&mdash;&#8203;for it was impossible
for men to have been brought to the “post” in better condition, or with a
stronger feeling of personal confidence. The articles specified that the belligerent
meeting was to take place halfway between Norwich and London,
but by mutual consent (although Crawley won the toss for choice) the
locality we have mentioned was eventually agreed upon&mdash;&#8203;thus combining a
double object of attraction&mdash;&#8203;the mill and the races&mdash;&#8203;and being alike convenient
to the training quarters of the combatants.</p>

<p>On Monday both men neared the point of rendezvous, Brassey being
installed at the “Queen Victoria,” Newmarket, and Caunt at Littlebury, in
Essex.</p>

<p>In the former town, too, the Commissary had lodged his <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</span> as early
as Saturday, being provided with new and substantial stakes for the
purpose&mdash;&#8203;a precaution which the herculean proportions of the men rendered
judicious.</p>

<p>As on all these occasions the betting was influenced by local prejudices;
and while at Leeds, Bradford, and their vicinities, the “Yorkshire tyke”
(Brassey) was the favourite at five to four, in Sheffield, Nottingham,
Newmarket, and London Caunt had the call at six and seven to four, and
finally at two to one and five to two, at which price large sums were
laid out.</p>

<p>With a view to prevent interruption, and to gratify the “sporting nobs”
of Newmarket, it was stipulated in the articles that the men should be in
the ring between eight and nine o’clock a.m.&mdash;&#8203;an arrangement which
proved most judicious, although it shut out a numerous class to whom
early rising and long trots of an autumnal morning are not agreeable.
The whisper, which was anything but soft, of the forthcoming event,
soon extended far and wide; and the arrivals from distant quarters at
Newmarket proved that the office had been very extensively circulated
and promptly obeyed&mdash;&#8203;as the unusual muster of fighting nobs on
Newmarket Heath, on the Monday, including all the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</span> of the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps
pugilistique</span>, sufficiently evinced. During the night the contributions from
the provinces increased; all the coaches passing through the town were
loaded, and the clatter of fresh arrivals in various equipages proved the
interest which had been excited.</p>

<p>Unfortunately a fine day had been succeeded by a night of heavy rain,
and the drenched appearance of the early birds, as they shook their
feathers, fully sustained the established rule that there are few human
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pageno">64</span>
amusements without alloy, or, as Sir G. Cornewall Lewis philosophically
put it, “Life would be tolerable were it not for its pleasures.” Still,
among the Fancy, these vicissitudes were of little moment, and were submitted
to with becoming philosophy. The morning was not more propitious
than the night, but there was, nevertheless, no lack of bustle in Newmarket;
in fact, hundreds were seen in busy preparation for “the start,”
and vehicles of every description were called into requisition, while all
classes, from the Corinthian to the humble stable-boy, were full of lively
anticipation. The troop of equestrians which went forth showed the
excitement that prevailed, while the carriages, gigs, and carts which
followed produced a cheerful commotion in the direction of the appointed
fixture, which was about six miles from the town.</p>

<p>A hostile declaration of a reverend parson of Cheveley, on the Monday,
led to an apprehension that an interruption was not unlikely. Indeed, we
believe it was intended, but happily his reverence, by some <em>unfortunate
accident</em>, was put on the wrong scent, and proceeded in an opposite direction,
towards the borders of Suffolk, where, attended by a posse of special
constables, he waited with creditable patience for the expected arrival of
the “misdoers.” He watched, however, in vain; in the interim the
belligerents had settled their differences elsewhere, to his infinite mortification,
as well as to the imminent danger of his health, from so long and
unprofitable an exposure to the warring elements. On his return to
Cheveley, his forlorn aspect induced strong expressions of commiseration;
but we are inclined to doubt the sincerity of those by whom they were
uttered, who obviously thought the worthy divine should not have forgotten
the old maxim, “Charity begins at home,” where, in all probability,
he would have found abundant opportunity for the exercise of his Christian
virtues without wasting them idly on the “desert air.”</p>

<p>An agreement having been made that both men should be in the ring
precisely at eight o’clock, by that hour the lists were completed, and
were quickly surrounded by the coming throng, who formed a circle of
ample dimensions round the all-important arena, which every moment
increased in density, and included in its motley features several foreigners
of distinction; a large contribution from the University of Cambridge (who
came in style in drags and fours, all “lighted up” in such profusion that
many were disposed to think, from the halo of smoke which fumed from
their fragrant havannahs, an engine had broken loose from some distant
railroad); a vast concourse of the Turf aristocracy, and not a few of the
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pageno">65</span>
right sort, who had posted from London to participate in the amusements
of the day. The remainder, to the extent of 2,000 or 3,000, was of that
mingled character which it would be difficult to particularise, many of
them being so disguised in their north-westers and storm-defying
protectors as to give them the advantage of perfect <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">incognito</span>, combined
with personal protection. We did hear of a stray magistrate or two being
present, yet for this we cannot vouch; but we must remark, if the fact
were so, it showed their good sense. This we do know, that one or two
proved by their conduct “none are so blind as those who will not see;”
and upon the appearance of the parson of Cheveley at the magisterial
divan in Newmarket on the same day, after the fight, to deplore the
hoax of which he had been made the victim, his vicissitudes produced a
good deal of fun, and not a little commendation of the ingenious concocter
of the “secret despatch” to which he had fallen so simple a victim.</p>

<p>Brassey was first on the ground; and as the rain fell in torrents
impatience was manifested for the arrival of Caunt. Unhappily,
however, he did not reach the cheerless scene till within five minutes of
nine. Come he did, however, at last, and the thrill of pleasure soon dissipated
the melancholy forebodings of disappointment; for it was feared
that Brassey would have been allowed to walk over the course and
claim forfeit. An inner circle of the privileged was soon formed by
those who chose to “qualify” by taking out “certificates” at 5s. each
from the Commissary. For the accommodation of these a quantity of
straw had been spread a few yards from the ring, but such was its saturated
state, from the continued rain, that it afforded little protection, and carriage
seats and gig cushions were in general request, often with little regard to
the laws of <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">meum</span> and <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">tuum</span>. Never was the modern invention of waterproof
wrappers more prized; and when we witnessed the aristocratic groups
thus recklessly reposing on the slimy soil we could not withhold the
expression of our delight at finding the spirit of olden times still unsubdued,
notwithstanding the inroads of pantilers and teetotallers. We recognised
among the mass many old soldiers, who good-humouredly remarked it was
but a memento of the past, and reminded their young friends the time
might not be far distant when even such inconvenience would be a luxury
compared with what they would have to endure in maintaining the fear-nought
reputation of John Bull on the “tented field.” Beyond the privileged
stood rows of perpendicular spectators, and behind them again
were the carriages and other vehicles, covered with not less anxious gazers.
</p>
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pageno">66</span>

<p>At last, soon after nine o’clock, the heroes of the day made their appearance;
Caunt under the care of Peter Crawley, and attended by Dick Curtis
and a Liverpool friend as bottle-holder and second; Brassey escorted by Ned
Painter, and officially accompanied by Jem Hall and Johnny Broome. On
entering the lists Caunt, who wore a large Welsh wig, approached Brassey,
and offered to lay him a private bet on the issue of the contest; but Brassey
regarded this as a piece of bounce, and turned from him. The umpires
and referee having been chosen, the yellowmen&mdash;&#8203;for both sported the same
colours&mdash;&#8203;were tied to the stake, and all prepared for action. On stripping,
the gigantic frame of Caunt struck the uninitiated with surprise. His superior
height and weight left no room for nice calculations, and the fate of
his adversary was already foretold; his broad back and muscular developments
had a most formidable aspect, while his long arms and proportionate
supporters showed him as a giant among <em>pigmies</em>, in which light Dick
Curtis, and some of his little friends who stood beside him, could alone be
regarded. There was, however, something ungainly in his huge frame, and
more of awkwardness than symmetry in his configuration. Brassey,
although less, was still “a man for a’ that,” and if not in juxtaposition
with such a Goliath would have been regarded as an excellent specimen of
the Grenadier fraternity. His figure was muscular and his limbs well knit,
exhibiting appearances of strength and vigour not to be despised, while his
mug displayed fearless determination. The preliminaries having been
adjusted, at twenty-five minutes after nine “business” commenced.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;No sooner had the seconds retired
to their corners, on leaving the men at
the scratch, than Caunt rushed to his man
and threw out his arms, left and right, with
the quickness and vigour of a just-started
windmill; his kind intentions were, however,
evaded, and he missed his blows, especially
a terrific upper-cut with his right,
which, had it reached its destination, would
have “told a tale.” Brassey in like manner
was wild, and missed his blows, but finding
Caunt closing upon him, he hit up with his
right, and on closing instantly went down.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt again hit out left and right, but
without precision. He made his right slightly
on Brassey’s nob, when the latter rattled in
left and right, like Caunt, missing, and again
went down. It was pretty obvious that
Brassey was fearful of the Russian hug of
<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ursa major</span>, and had made up his mind
to the falling system, which, however obnoxious
to the spectators, was evidently his
only safe game.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;“Steady,” cried Dick, “and hit
straight.” Caunt led off right and left,
and succeeded in planting his left on Brassey’s
forehead, but he had it in return.
Brassey got to him and delivered a tremendous
left-hander on his cheek, and was as
quick with his right on his nozzle; the claret
flew in abundance, and the big ’un was posed.
He hit out wild, left and right, and missed,
while Brassey got down. (Loud cheers for
Brassey. The spectators were electrified by
the effect of these blows. A gaping wound
ornamented Caunt’s right cheek, and his
nose emitted the purple fluid, which Dick
quickly mopped up with his sponge.)
This decided the first event&mdash;&#8203;<em>first blood</em>
for Brassey. (The Cauntites looking
queer.)</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt came up by no means improved
in beauty. He led on as before, wild left
and right; but his deliveries wanted precision.
Brassey fought with him, but, like
sticks in an Irish row, their arms were the
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pageno">67</span>
only receivers, and little mischief was done.
Brassey got down grinning.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt planted his left on Brassey’s
eye, but missed his right, which, had it
reached its destination, would have been a
poser. It went over Brassey’s shoulder.
Brassey, finding he could not well stand the
overwhelming rush of his antagonist, got
down.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Brassey popped in his left, and escaping
the visitation of Caunt’s left and right,
pursued his tumbling system, while Caunt
laughed, and pointed at him with contempt.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt, more successful, caught Brassey
left and right on the nob, when Brassey
went down, but Caunt’s blows did not seem
to tell.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt delivered his left and right, but
so wildly as to be ineffective, and Brassey
went down, throwing up his legs and knees
in the rebound.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt, as usual, opened the ball with a
wild rush right and left, catching Brassey
on the forehead with his right. Brassey hit
left and right, but was stopped, and went
down, Caunt with difficulty escaping treading
on him as he stepped over him.</p>

<p>     10, 11, 12.&mdash;&#8203;All of the same character,
Caunt doing no great execution, and Brassey
invariably getting down.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt hit out of distance with his
right, when Brassey caught him on the
smeller with his left, again drawing his
cork. Caunt, stung, hit out heavily with
his right, and caught Brassey on the back of
the ear. Brassey went down.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt, the first to fight, planted his
right on Brassey’s left eye; Brassey fell.
(First knock-down blow claimed, but doubtful,
as the ground became inconveniently
slippery.)</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt missed one of his tremendous
right-hand lunges, and Brassey went down.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt dropped heavily with his right
on Brassey’s ribs, who fought wildly, but
again caught Caunt with the left on his
damaged cheek; more blood, and Brassey
down.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Brassey in with his right on Caunt’s
ogle, and went down.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt, in his wild rush, hit Brassey
left and right on the pimple, and on his
going down, as he stepped over him, scraped
his forehead with his shoe, peeling off a
trifle of the bark.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt, more steady, planted his left on
Brassey’s dexter peeper, and hit him clean
down with his right. (<em>First knock-down blow</em>
unequivocally declared for Caunt.)</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt delivered his left heavily on
Brassey’s snout, and his right on the side of
his head. Brassey made play, but missed,
and went down. On being lifted on his
second’s knee, he bled from mouth and
nose.</p>

<p>     [The friends of Caunt, who had been
silent up to this, regarding the issue of the
battle anything but certain, now again
opened their potato traps, and offered 2 to 1,
which was taken.]</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt delivered another heavy body
blow with his right, which made a sounding
echo. Brassey rushed to a close, and clung
with his legs around Caunt’s thighs. Caunt
tried to hold him up with his left while he
hit with his right, but he found this impossible,
and flung him down with contempt.
It was here clear that if once Brassey suffered
himself to be grasped in a punishable
position by his opponent it would be all
over.</p>

<p>     22, 23, 24, and 25 were all pretty much in
the same style&mdash;&#8203;the hitting wild and ineffective,
Brassey either clinging to his man or
throwing himself down.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Another heavy blow on the ribs from
Caunt’s right told smartly on Brassey’s corporation.
Brassey attempted to close, but
Caunt threw him heavily with his head on
the ground.</p>

<p>     27, 28, 29.&mdash;&#8203;Not much done, Brassey going
down every round, after slight and wild exchanges.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt hit Brassey down with one of
his swinging right-handed hits on the side
of his head, which made his left eye twinkle
again. (3 to 1 offered and taken on Caunt.)</p>

<p>In the next three rounds there were some
heavy exchanges left and right, but Brassey
pursued his falling tactics.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Tremendous counter-hitting with the
right, and equally heavy exchanges with the
left. Both down on their knees, from the
stunning severity of the deliveries. (Caunt’s
beauty improving. A splendid likeness of
the “Saracen’s Head” without his wig.)</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;Again did Caunt nail his man on the
nose with his left, and the claret came forth
freely.</p>

<p>     From this to the 53rd round there were
some heavy exchanges left and right. To
all appearance, the punishment was most
severe on Caunt’s face, whose left cheek
was cut, as well as his right, but the heavy
deliveries on the left side of Brassey’s head,
as well as his ribs, had evidently weakened
him, although he still came up as game as a
pebble. In his frequent falls, Caunt occasionally
could not avoid falling on him, and
his weight was no trifling addition to his
other punishment. It is but just to state,
however, that Caunt fought in a fair and
manly style, and avoided everything like
unfair advantage.</p>

<p>     In the 55th round the ground became
so muddy that the men, from fighting in the
centre of the ring, could scarcely keep their
legs, and Brassey went down without a blow.
This was claimed, but rejected by the referee,
who cautioned him, however, against giving
such another chance away.</p>

<p>     56.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt planted his left heavily on
Brassey’s winker, but Brassey, in return,
hit him on the jaw with his right, and
making up his mind for further mischief,
repeated the blow with terrific effect a little
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">68</span>
below the same spot, Caunt countering at
the same moment, and with the same hand.
The collision was dreadful&mdash;&#8203;both fell in opposite
directions&mdash;&#8203;Caunt as if shot by a
twenty-four pounder, end Brassey all abroad.</p>

<p>Here was a decided change; Caunt was
evidently unconscious, and was with difficulty
held on his second’s knee. His head
rolled like a turtle in convulsions. Curtis,
however, steadied his tremulous pimple,
administered a slight dash of water, and on
“time” being called he was enabled to go
to the scratch, but with such groggy indications
that we doubt whether he knew if he
was on his head or his heels.</p>

<p>     57.&mdash;&#8203;Brassey now endeavoured to improve
his advantage, but instead of steadily waiting
to give his man the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span>, he
rushed in, and bored Caunt through the
ropes, and he fell on his back, while the
force of Brassey’s fall on him was stayed by
his own chin being caught by the upper
rope, on which he hung for a moment.</p>

<p>     58.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt recovered a little, but Brassey
again rushed in, hitting left and right, and
in the struggle both down, Brassey uppermost.</p>

<p>     59.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt steadied himself, and went in
to fight. Some heavy exchanges followed,
and Brassey went down, but Caunt was far
from firm on his pins. It was now seen
that Caunt’s right hand, from its repeated
visits to Brassey’s head and ribs, was much
swollen; his left, too, showed the effects of
repeated contact with the physog. of his
antagonist. This, in the following rounds,
led to a good deal of contention, on the
ground that Caunt had unfair substances in
his hand; but he showed it was only paper,
and threw it away, although entitled to the
use of any soft material to steady his grasp.</p>

<p>     The rounds which followed, to the
100th, offered but little variety; both
men became gradually exhausted, and it
required all the care and encouragement of
their partisans to rouse them to action.
Each was assured that victory smiled upon
him, and that it only required another
effort to make all safe. Brassey came up
manfully round after round; but although
he occasionally stopped and hit, the pops of
his opponent, who now and then saved him
the trouble of falling by hitting him down,
told with increasing effect. Caunt repeatedly
tried to hold him in the closes, with the
view of fibbing; but Brassey was too leary,
and got down without this additional proof
of kind intention. In some of his tumbles,
however, Caunt fell heavily on him, and
once more, in trying to evade him, scraped
his foot on his nose, a casualty almost unavoidable
from his sudden prostrations.</p>

<p>     The weakness of Brassey gradually increased,
while Caunt evidently got stronger
on his legs; and although his right hand
was gone, he continued to hit with it. He
was entreated to use his left, which he did
three times in succession in one round on
Brassey’s muzzle, till he dropped him. Such
was the prejudice in favour of Brassey,
however, from the vigour with which he
occasionally rallied, that it was still hoped
he might make a turn in his favour, and if
encouraging shouts would have effected that
object, he was not without stentorian friends.
Caunt, too, had his anxious attendants; and
all that cheering could do to rouse his spirits
was heartily afforded him.</p>

<p>     From the 90th to the 100th round poor
Brassey came up weak on his legs, and either
fell or was hit down, but to the last made
a manly struggle against superior strength
and weight. In the 100th round Broome
said he should fight no more, and Crawley
stepped into the ring to claim the battle;
he was, however, called out, and Brassey
came up once more, but he was incapable of
prolonged exertion, and being hit down with
a right-handed smack on the head, he
reluctantly submitted to the calls of his
friends to give in, and all was over. Caunt
was proclaimed the conqueror, after fighting
<em>one hundred and one rounds</em>, in <em>one hour
and thirty minutes</em>.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;We have seldom recorded a
fight in which we experienced more difficulty
to render the details interesting. It will be
seen that in ninety minutes one hundred
rounds were fought, deducting the half-minute
time, often prolonged to nearly a
minute by mutual delay in coming to the
“scratch” when “time” was called; therefore,
the average time occupied by each
round did not much exceed twenty seconds.
There was no attempt at stopping (except in
a few instances by Brassey), nor any of
those scientific manœuvres which give
interest to such an exhibition. Caunt was
invariably the first to fight, but led off with
nothing like precision, repeatedly missing
his blows and upper cuts, many of which,
had they told, might have been conclusive.
Brassey seemed to be fully aware of this
mode of assault, and generally waited till
he got within Caunt’s guard, and thus
succeeded in administering heavy punishment.
This point once gained he lost no
time in getting down, feeling quite confident
that in close contact he would not have had
a chance. This, although far from a popular
mode of contest, is certainly excusable considering
the inequality of the men in height
and weight, and the only surprise is that the
lesser man should have endured so much
before he cried “enough.” The repeated
visitations to his ribs from Caunt’s right, or
“sledge-hammer,” were searching in the
extreme, and led to the belief that three of
his ribs had been broken, although subsequent
examination proved that he was
only labouring under the effects of severe
contusions and inward bruises. In like
manner the right-handed deliveries behind
his left ear, on the ear itself, and on the left
eye and jaw, as well as the left-handed jobs,
were so far from <em>jocular</em> that we were not
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pageno">69</span>
surprised the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis comica</span> had ceased to be
displayed on his “dial,” and when to these
visitations are added his repeated falls, with
the weight of Caunt occasionally superadded
to his own, and this in such rapid succession,
the only surprise is he should have held out so
long. Caunt in his <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span> evinced
a sad ignorance of the art. Like the yokels
of old before the principles of mechanism
were discovered, he has to learn the proper
application of his strength, of which, did he
possess the requisite knowledge, he might
bid defiance not only to such a man as
Brassey, but even to the caperings of an
avalanche. He is not, like most men of his
size, slow&mdash;&#8203;on the contrary, he is too quick;
and for the want of judicious deliberation,
like a runaway steam-engine without a
controlling engineer, he over-shoots his
mark. This, if it be possible, he ought to
correct, and while he husbands his strength,
where he does apply it, he should measure
not only his distance but the tactics of his
opponent. Had he waited for his man,
instead of leading off with a rush, he must
have brought Brassey down every round,
for nothing could resist the force of his
heavy metal if properly applied. Strange
as it may appear, on examining both
men on Wednesday morning, the punishment
on the part of Caunt was greater than
that of Brassey, and viewing both frontispieces
and saying, “Look on this picture,
and on this,” our opinion would have been,
“Caunt has received the greater and more
effective punishment.” Added to this, his
hands, and especially the right, were
essentially <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</span>, while Brassey’s
were uninjured. Upon the whole, therefore,
although Caunt is the victor, and entitled
to praise, Brassey, as the vanquished,
deserves almost an equal degree of credit, if
not of profit. That this is the feeling of
others was demonstrated at Newmarket
after the battle, for there was not only £30
collected for him by voluntary contributions,
but a promise of still more liberal
consideration was held out, and in the end
fulfilled.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>On the Monday following, at Peter Crawley’s, “Duke’s Head,” Smithfield,
the battle money was paid over to Caunt, in the presence of an
overflowing muster of the patrons of British boxing. Brassey was present,
and confessed himself fairly conquered. A subscription was made to console
him for his honourable defeat, and £40 presented to him as a reward
for his valiant conduct, some merriment being excited by one of the
donations being announced as from “the parson of Cheveley.”</p>

<p>Caunt, in a short speech, stated that he once again claimed the “Championship
of England,” and was ready to make, then and there, a match for
£100 a side with any man, to fight within fifty miles of London. Nick
Ward, he added, had challenged him, and “he hoped he had pluck enough
to prove that his challenge was not mere bounce.”</p>

<p>Jem Ward lost no time in responding to Caunt’s remarks on his brother
Nick, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p>“<span class="sc">Mr. Editor</span>,&mdash;&#8203;The friends of Nick Ward have consulted, and consider (as his efforts in
the Ring have been but few, and as you, whose judgment, from long experience, is entitled
to great weight, have expressed an opinion that Nick Ward would never be a first-rate man)
that Caunt, who lays claim to the Championship, should, as a set-off to his superiority of
weight and position, give odds to make a match. Nick Ward, without bouncing, is willing
to fight Caunt if he will deposit £150 to Ward’s £100.</p>

</div><!--end letter-->

<p>The preliminaries were arranged without delay, and at Caunt’s benefit,
at the Bloomsbury Assembly Rooms, in the following week, a deposit was
made, and the next week articles drawn for the men to fight for £100 a
side, within two months, not more than sixty miles from London.
</p>
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">70</span>

<p>On February 2nd, 1841, in the seventh round and twelfth minute of the
fight, Caunt lost this battle by delivering a foul blow under irritation of
feeling at the shifty tactics of his opponent. (See Life of <span class="sc">Nick Ward</span>,
<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span>.)</p>

<p>Of course the matter could not rest thus&mdash;&#8203;that is, if, as many surmised
would not be the case, “brother Nick” could muster courage to
face once again his gigantic opponent.</p>

<p>In pursuance of appointment, Caunt and his friends met Nick Ward and
<abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> at Young Dutch Sam’s, the “Black Lion,” Vinegar Yard, Brydges
Street, on Thursday, the 18th of February, 1841, to draw up articles,
which set forth that&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The said Benjamin Caunt agrees to fight the said Nick Ward a fair stand-up fight, in a
four-and-twenty-foot roped ring, half-minute time, according to the New Rules, for one hundred
pounds a side, half-way between London and Liverpool; the place to be decided by
toss at the last deposit; neither place to exceed twenty miles from the direct line of road,
unless mutually agreed upon to the contrary. The fight to take place on Tuesday, the 11th
of May. In pursuance of this agreement twenty pounds a side are now deposited. A
second deposit of ten pounds a side to be made on Thursday, the 25th <abbr title="instant">inst.</abbr>, at Mr. Swain’s,
the ‘Greyhound,’ Woodside, Hatfield. A third deposit of ten pounds a side at the ‘Black
Lion,’ Vinegar Yard, on Thursday, the 4th of March. A fourth deposit of ten pounds a
side at the ‘Bell,’ Hatfield, on Thursday, the 11th of March. A fifth deposit of ten pounds
a side at the ‘Black Lion’ aforesaid, on Thursday, the 18th of March. A sixth deposit of
ten pounds a side at the ‘Cherry Tree,’ Kingsland Road, on Thursday, the 25th of March.
A seventh deposit of ten pounds a side at Jem Ward’s, Williamson Square, Liverpool, on
Thursday, the 1st of April. An eighth deposit of ten pounds a side at the Castle Tavern,
Holborn, on Thursday, the 8th of April; and the ninth and last deposit of ten pounds a
side at Young Dutch Sam’s, the ‘Black Lion,’ Vinegar Yard, on Thursday, the 22nd of
April. The said deposits to be made between the hours of eight and ten o’clock, or the
party failing to forfeit the money down. The men to be in the ring between twelve and
one o’clock, or at an early hour if mutually agreed upon, or the money down to be forfeited
by the party absent. Two umpires and a referee to be chosen on the ground; the decision
of the latter, in the event of dispute, to be conclusive. In case of magisterial interference
the stakeholder to name the next time and place of meeting, unless a referee shall have been
chosen, to whom that duty shall be assigned. The fight to come off on the same day if possible;
but the money not to be given up till fairly won or lost by a fight. The ropes and
stakes to be paid for by the men, share and share alike. Neither man to use resin or other
powder to his hands during the combat. The party winning the toss for choice of place to
name the ground seven days before fighting to the backers of the party losing the toss.”</p>

<p>The parties, after signing, shook hands with great good humour, and
joined in drinking the general toast, “May the best man win!” Caunt
expressed much mortification at the assertion which he said had been
made that the cause of his loss of the late fight was attributable to
design rather than accident. He protested that he acted from the ungovernable
impulse of the moment, irritated by Ward’s going down at the
moment he was within his reach. He said, further, that he would profit by
his experience, and be specially careful to avoid a similar “accident.” The
backers of Ward offered to take six to four on the issue; but odds were
refused.
</p>
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pageno">71</span>

<p>The deposits duly made, Young Dutch Sam, who acted on Nick Ward’s
behalf, won the toss for choice of ground, and named Stratford-on-Avon for
the place of meeting. The selection of Shakespeare’s birthplace proved
judicious, as the proceedings from first to last passed off without interruption.
We may perhaps note that one inducement of Ward to the
choice of Stratford-on-Avon might be that there, in July, 1831, his brother
Jem closed his brilliant career by defeating Simon Byrne at Willycuts,
three miles from the town.</p>

<p>Caunt reached Stratford on Monday afternoon, in company of Tom
Spring, and made the “Red Horse” his resting-place. Nick Ward,
accompanied by his brother, put up at the “White Lion.” Every inn in
the place was crammed to overflowing, and many who were unable to procure
beds at any price returned to Warwick or Leamington, and some even
to Coventry, necessitating a return journey the next morning. We must,
in justice to the many followers of the four-square Ring, state that the
utmost order and regularity prevailed in the town throughout the evening,
and that hilarity, joviality, and good temper prevailed among the partisans
of both men, a fact which we would commend to electors and political
factions.</p>

<p>All were astir early, and there was a strong muster of Corinthians of the
first water&mdash;&#8203;indeed, the “upper crust” was unusually well represented by
numerous hunting men from the “shires,” who, by liberal expenditure,
gave the good, hospitable fellow-townsmen of the immortal Will every
reason to be grateful for the selection which had been made; and they, on
their part, showed their sense of the obligation conferred by their civility
and the moderation of their charges.</p>

<p>The scene of action was in a field at Long Marsden, on a farm belonging
to a Mr. Pratt; and thither the Commissary proceeded to make his
arrangements, and thither also the immense cavalcade of equestrians and
charioteers, as well as innumerable groups of pedestrians, took their way in
due time. On the last occasion the unlucky “footpads” were thrown out
entirely, but on this they had undoubtedly the best of it, for they, by means
of short cuts and familiar paths, shortened their pleasant journey, while
those who were on four legs&mdash;&#8203;or worse, on wheels&mdash;&#8203;were compelled to
scramble and jolt over roads of the most villainous description, in which the
most imminent risks of spills or a break-down were only avoided by care
and good luck. In fact, many of those who endured the miseries of both
roads declared, that the sixteen miles between the Andover road and
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
Crookham Common, with all its horrors, was surpassed by the shorter
journey from Stratford to Long Marsden.</p>

<p>The spot was admirably selected, and the ropes and stakes pitched upon
a piece of sound, elastic turf that delighted the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognoscenti</span>. The immense
multitude, as they arrived, arranged themselves in a most orderly, methodical
manner. The day was beautiful, the country around green, fresh, and
odoriferous with the blossoms of the may. Everything was conducted in a
style to ensure general satisfaction.</p>

<p>Caunt made his appearance first, with an oddly assorted pair of seconds
as ever handled a champion in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> They were old Ben Butler, his
uncle, well known in after times in the parlour of the “Coach and Horses;”
a man well stricken in years, and a cross-grained old curmudgeon to boot.
With him appeared Atkinson, of Nottingham, a 9½ stone man, whose disparity
of size with the man he was supposed to pick up excited the risibility
of old ring-goers. Benjamin himself, however, seemed particularly well
satisfied, and remarked laughingly, in reply to a jocose observation of a
bystander, “Never thee mind&mdash;&#8203;<em>I’m</em> not goin’ to tummle down; he’s big
enow for me!” Had the fight which ensued been of the desperate character
of Ben’s late encounter with Brassey, the ill-assorted pair could about as
much have carried Colossus Caunt to his corner as they could have carried
the Achilles in Hyde Park. Nick had with him, as on the former occasion,
Harry Holt and Dick Curtis, certainly the two ablest counsellors on
the Midland, Northern, or any other Circuit. Tom Spring, who was in
friendly attendance upon Caunt, addressed an emphatic warning to the big
one to keep his temper, cautioning him not to play into the hands of his
opponent by allowing himself to be irritated by his shifty dodges. Caunt
listened with a grim, self-satisfied smile, and nodded his head, as much as to
say he was not going to be caught this time. Each man, in reply to a
question, declared he “never felt better in his life,” and their looks justified
the assertion. Caunt was a little “finer drawn” than at their
previous meeting, and weighed, when stripped, exactly 14<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> He never
went to scale so light before&mdash;&#8203;indeed, it was not an excessive weight
for a big-boned man measuring 6 feet 2½ inches. He had, however, a
narrow escape in his training, for, on the Sunday week previous, in his
walking exercise, he trod on a stone, and turned his foot aside with such
suddenness as to strain the muscles of his leg and ankle so severely that he
was unable to walk for several days, exciting the serious apprehensions of
his friends; with rest and constant surgical care, however, he overcame the
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">73</span>
mischief, and was as well as ever. Ward looked to us a trifle too fleshy.
He weighed 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, 10<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> more than when he fought in February.</p>

<p>Some time previously a subscription had been raised to produce a
“Champion’s Belt,” to be given to the victor on this occasion, and to be
hereafter transferable, should he retire from the Ring or be beaten by a
more successful candidate for fistic honours. This belt, under the superintendence
of a committee, was completed, and now for the first time was held
forth as an additional incitement to bravery and good conduct. Previous
to the commencement of the battle, Cicero Holt, the well-known orator of
the Ring, and second of Nick Ward, approached the scratch, and silence
being called, held up the belt, pronouncing that in addition to the stakes
this trophy had been prepared by a number of liberal gentlemen, as a spur
to the honest and manly feeling which it was desirable should ever pervade
the minds of men who sought distinction in the Prize Ring. “Honour
and fair play,” it was their opinion, should be the motto of English boxers,
and it would be their proud gratification to see this belt girded round the
loins of him, whoever he might be, who entitled himself in spirit and
principle to the terms of that motto. They were influenced by neither
favour nor affection, nor by prejudice of any kind; all they desired was
that the best man might win, wear this trophy, and retain it so long as he
was enabled to maintain the high and distinguished title of Champion of
England. On resigning, or being stripped of the laurels of Championship,
it would then be his duty to transfer this proud badge to his more fortunate
successor, and thus a prize would be established which it would ever be the
pride of gallant Englishmen to possess, and its brightness, he trusted,
would never be tarnished by an act of dishonour. It was to be finally
presented, he said, when complete, at a dinner to be given at Jem Burn’s,
where the subscription originated, on Monday, the 31st instant.</p>

<p>The belt was then exhibited to the gaze of the curious; it is composed
of purple velvet, and lined with leather; in the centre are a pair of clasped
hands surrounded by a wreath of the Rose, the Thistle, and the Shamrock,
entwined in embossed silver; on each side of this are three shields of bright
silver, at present without inscription, but on these are to be engraven the
names of all the Champions of England which the records of the Fancy
preserve, to conclude with the name of the conqueror on the present occasion.
The clasps in front are formed of two hands encased in sparring-gloves.
It is due to state that this belt is altogether very beautifully
executed, and highly creditable to the motives and good feeling to
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pageno">74</span>
which its origin is attributable. Its inspection afforded general pleasure, and
the oration of “Cicero” was received with loud cheers. Caunt, on taking
it in his hand, significantly said to Nick Ward, “This is mine, Nick,” to
which Ward replied, “I hope the best man may win it and wear it.”</p>

<p>These preliminaries, so novel in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, having been concluded, the
colours of the men were entwined on the stake, and umpires and a referee
having been chosen, no time was lost in preparing for action.</p>

<p>The betting at first was 5 to 4 on Ward, though we never could understand
the quotation, and did not see any money posted at the odds. At
twenty minutes to one all was ready, and the champions toed the scratch for</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;The men faced each other with
an expression of good humour on their countenances
that could hardly be expected by
those who knew how they had expressed
themselves at former meetings. Caunt’s
rough lineaments bore a grin of satisfaction,
that seemed to say he had his wishes gratified.
Ward, though he also smiled, it was a
vanishing smile, and he looked eagerly and
anxiously at his antagonist. Ward’s attitude
was scientific and well guarded, his
left ready for a lightning-shot, as he poised
himself on his left toe, with his right somewhat
across, to parry the possible counterhit.
Caunt stood erect, as if to make the
most of his towering height, but a trifle
backward. Ward moved about a little, as if
measuring his distance, and then let go his
left. It was not a determined hit, and did
not get home. Caunt dashed out his left in
return, but Nick stopped it prettily. However,
as he meant it for a counter, his friends
were pleased at his quickness, and cheered
the attempt, especially as he almost instantly
followed it with a lunge from the right,
which just reached Ward’s neck. The big
one now bored in for a close, meaning mischief.
Ward bobbed his head aside, delivered
a slight job, and was down on his
knees. It was clear that Nick meant to
fight in the evasive style of their former
encounter, but it was also clear from Caunt’s
coolness that he was likely to have more
trouble over this day’s business, and we
heard no more about odds upon Ward.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;The men faced each other as before,
no harm as yet having been done on either
side. Caunt now began manœuvring in
rather an ungainly manner; but as some of
his movements suggested a plunge in, Nick
was resolved to be first, and let go his left
on Caunt’s mouth, who heeded not the blow,
but dashed out left and right. The blows
were wild, but his right reached Ward’s
cheek; and Caunt was pulling himself
together for heavy punching, when once
more Ward slipped his foot, and was on
both knees. Caunt threw up both hands,
and gave a sort of guttural “Hur, hur!” as
he looked at the cunning face of his opponent,
then walked to his own corner. The
big one’s friends were delighted at this
proof of caution, and cheered lustily.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Ward came up with a keen and anxious
look at his opponent. Ben nodded, and
flourished his long arms like the sails of a
windmill. He seemed ready to let Ward
lead off and then take his chance of going in
for the return. Ward drew back at arm’s
length, and Caunt hit short more than once,
but Nick did not get near enough for an
effective return. Caunt, with a grim smile,
almost rolled in, sending out left and right
as he came. His right just reached Ward’s
head, who hit up sharply and then slipped
down, as though from his own blow. It was
a very questionable get-down, but there was
no appeal.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Nick seemed to feel that he was by no
means taking the lead, and he was told that
unless he hit, and kept Caunt employed in
defending himself, he would bore in on him
continually. The advice was doubtless
sound, but it wanted more pluck than Nick
possessed to put it in practice. Nick hit out
with his left, but not near enough, and Caunt
stopped him, amid some cheering; Caunt
paused, as if expecting Ward to come closer,
but he did not, so he let fly, and in a sort of
ding-dong rally gave Ward a tidy smack on
the nose; Nick jobbed him heavily three or
four times, then dropped so close to Caunt
that they both rolled over, the big one
falling heavily on Nick. On rising blood
was seen oozing from Ward’s nose, and the
first event was awarded to Caunt, amidst
the cheers of his friends, and to the astonishment
of Ward’s backers.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;The faces of both men were flushed
from the blows received, and Caunt, who
was anxious to be at work, went in at once,
left and right, again catching Ward upon
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">75</span>
the nose, and increasing the appearance
of claret. Ward made no return, he was too
anxious to get away, and on Caunt grappling
him, he got quickly down, Caunt stumbling
forward and falling over him.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;The rounds were too short and hurried
to admit of much in the way of description.
Caunt, still eager to be at work, tried his
left, but was stopped. Counter-hits with
the left followed, but though Nick was a
fine counter-hitter, he never exhibited any
great relish for that mode of fighting&mdash;&#8203;the
most telling in its effects and most exciting
to witness of all practised in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P. R.</abbr>
Caunt lashed out with his left, and on Nick’s
cleverly avoiding the smash, rushed to
in-fighting. Nick, however, pursued his
plan of getting down, but Caunt came
heavily upon him. Although up to the
present time Caunt had not done much
execution, yet he was certainly getting the
best of the fight, and he maintained his
improvement in his style of hitting, substituting
straight hits from the shoulder for
the overhanded chops which had formerly
marked his attempts.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Ward tried to regain the lead&mdash;&#8203;if he had
ever had it&mdash;&#8203;and let fly with his left, but he
had not sufficient courage to go close to his
man, and once again the blow fell short.
He stopped Caunt’s attempt at a return
with his left, which came pretty heavy and
quickly, and on the latter’s rushing in for
close work Nick dropped on his knees.
There was no blow struck in this round, and
Caunt, who was about to deliver, wisely
restrained his hand, and with his deep, short
laugh, shook his finger menacingly at Ward
as he knelt, and walked away.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Up to this period no material damage
had been done on either side, few of the hits
having more than a skin-deep effect. Ward
still preserved his elegant attitude, and tried
his left, but did not get home, and Caunt
hit short at the body with his right. Nick
now steadied himself for mischief, and, after
a short pause, threw his left with the quickness
of lightning, and caught Caunt over the
right eyebrow, on which it left a gaping
wound, from which a copious crimson stream
flowed over the undamaged optic and down
his cheek. Caunt hit out wildly, left and
right; Ward, in retreating, fell on his knees,
and Caunt tumbled over him.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Atkinson was seen to be busily engaged
in stopping the flow of claret from Caunt’s
eyebrow when “Time!” was called. At
the sound Caunt jumped up vigorously, and
continued the contest with a figurehead
anything but improved by the crimson stain
which marked its right side. Nick smiled
at his handiwork, waited for his man, and
as Caunt came plunging in, met him with a
heavy hit from the left on the cheek, opening
an ancient wound originally inflicted by
Brassey, and starting a fresh tap of claret.
Caunt was stung by the hits, and dashed in
left and right; but Ward adhered to his
dropping tactics, and again fell on his knees,
amidst strong expressions of disapprobation.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Ward again tried his left, but was
unsuccessful; Caunt came in, and after a
couple of slight exchanges, left and right,
Nick got down.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt came up nothing daunted,
stopped an attempt with Ward’s left, and
made a terrific rush, which if as clumsy as
the elephant’s was almost as irresistible.
Nick retreated, stopping left and right, till
he fell under the ropes, amidst cries of dissatisfaction,
Caunt dropping on him.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Ward stopped Caunt’s left and right,
and almost immediately dropped on his knees,
and while in that position instantly hit up
left and right, delivering both blows heavily;
that from his right, on Caunt’s ear, from
whence blood was drawn, was evidently a
stinger. Spring, who witnessed this, exclaimed
against so cowardly a practice, and
observed that the blows of Ward were
obviously foul, inasmuch as Ward had no
more right to hit when down on his knees
than Caunt had a right to strike him in that
position. The umpires, however, did not
interfere, and the referee cautioned Ward
to be more circumspect in his conduct.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt, lively as a young buffalo,
rushed to the scratch the moment time was
called, and immediately made play. Nick,
as usual, retreated, when Caunt endeavoured
to close, but Nick in his cowardly way
dropped on both knees. Caunt’s right hand
was up, and he was unable to restrain the
falling blow, but it fell lightly, and although
“down” no claim was made. (Spring and
Atkinson both cautioned Caunt to be more
careful, for, however unintentional, if he
struck his opponent when down the consequences
might be serious.)</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt led off, and caught Nick on
the side of his head with his left, and
repeated the dose on the opposite side with
his right. Nick popped in a touch with his
left on Caunt’s nasal promontory&mdash;&#8203;Caunt
missed a terrific hit with his right, and
Nick went on his knees to avoid punishment.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt, who was now evidently provoked
by the cowardly game of Ward in getting
down in every round, the moment he
came to the scratch rushed to him, and
endeavoured to get him within his grasp in
such a way as to be enabled to fall with him.
Unluckily, however, instead of catching
him round the body he caught him round
the neck, and, in this manner, lifting him
off the ground, for a short time held him
suspended. He then let him go, but did
not succeed in giving him the <em>scrunch</em> he
contemplated. Instead of this, he hit the
back of his own head against the stakes,
and incurred an ugly concussion.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt came up full of life and frolic,
and was first at the scratch. Nick made
play with his left, but Caunt stopped and
got away. Caunt hit short with his right,
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pageno">76</span>
and after a short pause right-hand hits were
exchanged&mdash;&#8203;Nick at the head, Caunt at the
body. Caunt immediately closed, and caught
Nick’s pimple under his arm, but Nick
slipped down, and looked up as if expecting
to be hit.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Trifling exchanges, when Nick again
provokingly slipped on his knees.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt led off, planted his left
slightly, and Nick down on his knees.
Caunt looked at him derisively and laughed,
exclaiming, “It won’t do to-day, Nick.”</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt still fresh as a four-year-old,
and first to the scratch, Nick evidently
fearful of approaching too near. Caunt
made a feint, with his left, and then delivered
a tremendous round right-handed blow on
the base of Ward’s ribs; the blow was too
high, or it might have told fearfully. Nick
let go his left, and Caunt jumped back, but
again coming to the charge Ward retreated.
Caunt following him up again seized him
with a Herculean grip round the neck, lifted
him clean off the ground, and then fell
squash upon him.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Some tolerably good exchanges, in
which Nick hit straightest, but immediately
went down&mdash;&#8203;Caunt pointing at him with
contempt.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Nick tried his left and right, but
missed, his timidity evidently preventing
his getting sufficiently near to his man.
Caunt again seized him, lifted him up, and
fell upon him, but lightly.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt hit short at the body with his
right, and tried his left, which was stopped.
Counter-hits with the right, ditto with the
left, when Nick went down.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Ward planted his left heavily on
Caunt’s mug, and opened his previous
wounds; this he followed with a touch from
his right on the ear. Caunt rushed wildly
to the charge, but Nick, as usual, tumbled,
this time rolling over away from Caunt.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt rushed forward, and delivered
his left and right on Ward’s nob, the first
on his nose, the second on the side of his
head; Ward’s nose again trickled with the
purple fluid. Nick went down on his knees,
amidst shouts of disapprobation.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt delivered his left on the head
and right on the body, with stinging effect,
and Nick went down.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Nick again had it on his nose from
the left, and dropped on his knees. Caunt,
who had his right up with intent to deliver,
withheld the blow, and walked away.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Nick slow in approaching the scratch,
and Caunt impatient to be at him. Holt
cautioned Caunt not to cross the scratch till
his man reached it. Caunt let fly with his
right, and again caught Nick heavily on the
body, following this up with a smart touch
from his left on the mazzard. Nick again
went down on one knee, and, while in that
position, struck Caunt with his left. Caunt
stooped, nodded, and laughed at him, as he
looked up in his face. Nick also nodded
and laughed. “We’ll have a fair fight to-day,
Nick,” said Caunt.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Good counter-hits with the left, when
Caunt once more grasped Ward, and held
him up; but Ward slipped from his arms,
and got down.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;Ward slow, when Caunt planted two
right-handed hits on Ward’s jaw and neck.
Ward slipped down on one knee, but Caunt
refrained from striking him, although entitled
to do so by the rules of the Ring.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt lost no time in rushing to his
man, and planted his right heavily on the
side of his head. Ward hit widely left and
right, and went down on his face.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Ward evidently began to lose all
confidence, and fought extremely shy.
Caunt rushed in, caught his head under his
arm, and although he might have hit him
with great severity, he restrained himself,
and let him fall.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;Ward came up evidently counter to
his own inclinations, being urged forward
by his seconds. Caunt caught him left and
right, and he fell to avoid further punishment.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt gave a lungeing slap with his
right on Ward’s pimple, when Ward dropped
on both knees, and popped his head between
Caunt’s knees. He seemed disposed to poke
in anywhere out of danger’s way, and any
odds were offered on Caunt.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt rushed in to mill, but Ward
had obviously made up his mind to be satisfied,
and down he went without a blow.</p>

<p>     35, and last.&mdash;&#8203;Ward was “kidded” up
once more by his second and bottle-holder;
but it was clear that all the King’s horses
and all the King’s men could not draw him
to the scratch with anything like a determination
to protract the combat. Caunt let
fly right and left at his mug, and down he
went for the last time. His brother ran to
him, but it was all up; and as the only excuse
for such a termination to the battle,
Nick pretended that his ribs were broken
from the heavy right-handed hits of Caunt,
and that he was incapable of continuing the
contest. Caunt was thus proclaimed the
conqueror, and “THE CHAMPION OF
ENGLAND,” amidst a general cheer, and
expressions of contempt towards Ward&mdash;&#8203;so
strongly emphasised that the usual collection
for the losing man was omitted by Holt,
who shook a hat with a few halfpence he had
himself dropped into it, and then put them
in his pocket with a laugh.</p>

<p>     We examined the supposed fracture in his
ribs, but could discover nothing beyond
severe contusions. It will be recollected
that Brassey closed his labours with Caunt
upon similar grounds, though perhaps with
better reason. Nick was immediately conveyed
to his omnibus, where he became
prostrate in mind and body, exciting but
little sympathy in the breasts of the general
body of spectators. The fight lasted forty-seven
minutes. The ceremony of girding
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pageno">77</span>
Caunt with the Champion’s Belt then took
place, and it was put round his loins, with
a hearty wish from those who witnessed his
unflinching courage from first to last, as well
as his manly forbearance amidst cowardly
provocation, that he might long retain it.
He afterwards went to Ward’s carriage, and
offered him all the consolations of which he
was susceptible, hoping that they might
hereafter be the best friends, a feeling which
Jem Ward, who evidently blushed for the
pusillanimity of his brother, good-naturedly
reciprocated. Caunt, he said, had proved
himself the better man, and should always
be an acceptable guest at his house. We
ought to have mentioned that Caunt, on
quitting the ring, disdained to do so in the
usual way, but leaped clear over the ropes,
a height of four feet six, and on his way
home ran a pretty fast race against a
“Corinthian” across a piece of ploughed
land for a bottle of wine, which he cleverly
won.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;The report of this fight tells
its own tale. Nick Ward’s conduct completely
confirmed the suspicions of his
chicken-hearted pretensions. He wanted
that one requisite of all others indispensable
to a pugilist&mdash;&#8203;courage; and although his
science was unquestionable, it can only be
displayed to advantage in the sparring
school. As he said himself after his fight
with Sambo Sutton, he “was not cut out
for a fighting man;” and the best advice we
can give him is to retire altogether from the
Ring. Caunt, who from the first booked
victory as certain, sustained his character
for bravery, and left off as fresh as when he
commenced, although somewhat damaged
in the frontispiece. His right eyebrow and
cheek were much swollen, and the back of
his head displayed a prominent bump of
combativeness from the fall against the
stakes. His hands were little damaged, but
the knuckle of his right hand showed that
it had come in ugly contact with Nick’s
“pimple” or ribs. He was much improved
in his style of fighting since his former
exhibitions in the Ring; instead of hitting
over the guard, as was his former practice,
he hit straight from the shoulder, and
having learned to lead off with his left, was
enabled the more effectively to bring the
heavy weight of his right into useful play.
He still, however, hit round with his right,
and the most severe blows which Ward
received during the contest were those
which were planted on the ribs and side of
the head with this hand. These blows, with
the heavy falls, to which was superadded
the weight of his antagonist, no doubt
tended to extinguish the little courage he
might have possessed. Caunt was carefully
seconded by his aged uncle and Atkinson,
and although, had it been necessary to carry
him to his corner, they might not have been
able to afford him the requisite assistance,
as that necessity did not arise no fault was
to be found. Throughout the battle excellent
order was maintained, and there were none
of those irregularities observable on the
former occasion. Jem Ward and his friends
conducted themselves with great propriety,
and submitted to defeat as well as to the loss
of their money with as good a grace as could
well have been expected. To the amateurs
and patrons of British boxing the conduct
of Nick Ward was most displeasing, and
they one and all declared that they had
never seen a man whose pretensions to the
Championship had been more disgracefully
exposed. Caunt came to town the same
night, accompanied by Tom Spring, and on
reaching the “Castle” was received with
universal congratulations.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Caunt now resolved, after the fashion of our great public performers, to
make a trans-Atlantic trip, to show the New World a specimen of an
Old World champion, and to add another “big thing” to the country of
“big things;” though in this America sustained her eminence by sending
us a bigger champion than our “Big Ben” himself, in the form of
Charles Freeman, of whom more anon.</p>

<p>Ben’s departure was thus announced on the 10th of September, 1841&mdash;&#8203;“Ben
Caunt, Champion of England, sailed from Liverpool for New York
on Thursday, taking with him the Champion’s Belt, for which, he says, any
Yankee may become a candidate.”</p>

<p>In the <cite>New York Spirit of the Times</cite> of November 13th we find this
paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p>“Caunt, the ‘Champion of England,’ arrived on Monday week last in the packet ship
‘Europe,’ bringing with him the Champion’s Belt. He has appeared several times at the
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pageno">78</span>
Bowery Theatre, in ‘Life in London,’ being introduced in the scene opening with Tom
Cribb’s sparring-room. He is an immensely powerful man, two or three inches above six
feet in height, and well proportioned. Caunt’s reputation at home is that of a liberal, manly
fellow; prodigious strength and thorough game have won him more battles than his
science, though he is no chicken. The following challenge has appeared in some of the
daily papers: ‘Challenge&mdash;&#8203;To Caunt, the Champion of England,&mdash;&#8203;Sir, I will fight you for
500 dollars, three months from this date, the forfeit money to be put up at any time and place
you may name. You can find me at 546, Grand Street.&mdash;&#8203;Yours, <span class="sc">James Jerolomon</span>.”</p>
</div><!--end letter-->

<p>This challenge, of course, was mere “buncombe.” After a profitable and
pleasant tour, in which, as he declared on his return, he met nothing but
hospitality and civility from our American cousins, Ben returned to
England early in 1842, accompanied by a magnificent specimen of
humanity named Charles Freeman, dubbed, for circus and theatre purposes,
“Champion of the World;” and truly, if bulk and height were the
prime requisites of a boxer, Charles Freeman was unapproachable in these
respects.</p>

<p>The first mention of Freeman is in a letter from Caunt, dated from New
York, December 20th, 1841, in which we suspect the hand of some Yankee
Barnum, rather than the fist of burly Ben, may be detected. Caunt
says, “I declared my intention of not fighting in America, but if anything
can tempt me to change my intention, it will be the following circumstance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p>“When at Philadelphia I intended taking a Southern tour, but an unexpected circumstance
brought me back to New York. There appeared a challenge in the papers of New
York from the Michigan Giant to me; my friends at New York went to try to make a match
with him; they offered to back me for ten thousand dollars a side, and sent for me to return
as soon as possible. There is no match made yet, but it is likely there will be soon. I am
quite prepared to fight him&mdash;&#8203;he is the only man who could draw me from my first determination.
This Giant is seven feet three inches high, proportionally stout, and very active; he
can turn twenty-five somersets in succession, can hold a large man out at arm’s length, he
weighs 333<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, and has nothing but muscle on his bones. I have all reasons to believe a
match will be made. I expect to be in England in a short time if the above match is not
made, when I shall be ready to accommodate Bendigo. You will oblige me by inserting
some or the whole of the above in your valuable columns.</p>

<p class="flushright">
I remain, Yours, <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> &emsp;&emsp;“BENJAMIN CAUNT.”</p>

<p class="pneg">“New York, December 20th, 1841.”</p>
</div><!--end letter-->

<p>That there were showmen before Artemus Ward, as ingenious, if not so
“genial” or witty, the reader must allow. The bathos of being ready for
little Bendigo, after disposing of a monster “seven feet three inches high,
and proportionally stout,” and “weighing 23<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 11<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>,” is overwhelming.
The “gag” is sufficiently indicated by another paragraph from a New York
paper, in which the “Michigan Giant” becomes the “New York Baby,”
without any mention of fistic collision between the so-called “Champions.”</p>

<div class="fight">
<p>“The amateurs of the Ring have been on the ‘ki wivy’ (according to a notorious ex-justice
of police) since the arrival of the English Champion, Caunt. He has just concluded
a successful engagement at one of the Philadelphia theatres, after having appeared several
nights here at the Bowery, in ‘Life in London.’ Caunt has put on the gloves for a friendly
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pageno">79</span>
set-to with most of our amateurs at Hudson’s ‘Sparring Rooms and Pistol Gallery,’ corner
of Broadway and Chambers Street; he hits hard, and is as active as a bottle imp. But ‘a
baby’ has at length been found who promises to show both fun and fight, in the shape of a young
New Yorker, standing seven feet in his stockings, and whose weight is three hundred and
fifteen pounds. His name is Charles Freeman, and he is about the tallest specimen of our
city boys that ever came under the notice of the ‘Tall Son of York.’ He has immense
muscular developments, and is well put together, with arms and legs strong enough for the
working-beam or piston-rod of a Mississippi steamboat. Freeman has lately returned from
a visit through the British Provinces, where he was sufficiently successful to lay claim to
Cæsar’s motto, ‘<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veni, vidi, vici</span>.’ At Halifax, recently, some one sent him a challenge,
which was accepted, but upon seeing the ‘New York Baby,’ waived the honour of meeting
him, except with the muffles on. It is, we believe, arranged that our specimen youth shall
accompany the English Champion back to the Old World, where, we’ll lay a pile, they’ll be
gravelled to match him.”</p>
</div><!--end letter-->

<p>These pilot balloons were soon followed by the return of the doughty Ben
with his Giant <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span>, in the month of March, 1842. The “sparring tours”
were carried out by Ben and his Giant partner, including appearances at
provincial theatres, <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> with an undercurrent of pugilistic challenges and
“correspondence” kept up in the sporting papers, in which the Tipton Slasher
challenged the American Giant, and Bendigo now and then offered terms
to Ben himself. These do not belong to a history of pugilism, and we pass
them by, with a mere reference to our notice of Freeman’s fiasco with the
clumsy Tipton Slasher in another place. (See Life of <span class="sc">William Perry</span>,
Chapter <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>)</p>

<p>We may here interject a paragraph to say that the cup which Ben was
wont to exhibit to visitors to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s Lane, as the “Champion of
England’s Cup,” was a handsome piece of plate, subscribed for by a number
of Ben’s admirers and friends in Newcastle, Gateshead, Nottingham,
<abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and presented to him at a “spread” at Izzy Lazarus’s, “Cross
Keys,” Gateshead, on the date given in the inscription, which was as
follows: “Presented to Benjamin Caunt, Champion of England, by his
Newcastle friends, as a token of respect for his abilities as a pugilist and
his conduct as a man, July 6th, 1842.”</p>

<p>That Ben kept himself before the public, may be gathered from the
following comprehensive challenge, which we select from several of
the same character, and which served for gossip for the gobemouches in
1843 and 1844:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">“To the Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;&#8203;Seeing a challenge from Bendigo this week, I shall be happy to meet him on his
own terms, £200 a ride (in which I heartily hope he will not disappoint me). I will meet him
at my own house, on Tuesday evening next, to stake not less than £20 as a first deposit. Should
this challenge not be accepted, I will fight Bendigo, Tass Parker, and the Tipton Slasher,
once each within six months, for £200 a side, and shall be prepared to deposit £60&mdash;&#8203;<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, £20
each match&mdash;&#8203;as the first deposit, any time at my house, or at Tom Spring’s, the Castle
Tavern, Holborn. Should this not be ‘a go’ within four months, I shall beg most respectfully
to decline the Ring altogether.</p>

<p>By many it was thought that the severe accident which had occurred to
Bendigo, and occasioned a forfeit by him of £75 to Tass Parker, had
placed another contest between him and the ponderous Ben out of the
question. This did not, however, prove to be the case. At a sporting
dinner at Owen Swift’s, at which, besides a full muster of Corinthians,
Tom Spring, Peter Crawley, Jem Burn, Frank Redmond, Tom Oliver,
Dan Dismore, Bill Jones, and many of the “professionals” were present,
the matter of the Championship was formally discussed.</p>

<p>Therein, with the consent of Caunt, Bendigo was matched to fight him
for £200, Caunt’s subscription belt, and the Championship, and the Tipton
Slasher staked £10 as a first deposit to fight the winner. How the first
of these events did come off (unsatisfactorily), and how the second did <em>not</em>
come off at all, are fully recorded in the lives of <span class="sc">Bendigo</span> and of <span class="sc">William
Perry</span>. Suffice it here to say that Caunt lost his third battle with Bendigo
by falling without a blow. (See Chapter <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, <a href="#Page_28">page 28</a>, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span>.)</p>

<p>A fearful catastrophe, by which the Champion suffered a heavy domestic
bereavement, occurred during Caunt’s temporary absence from London on
a visit to some country friends in Hertfordshire.</p>

<p>By a fire which suddenly broke out at the “Coach and Horses,” <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Martin’s Lane, of which Caunt was at this time the landlord, two of
Caunt’s children, and the servant by whom they were attended, were burnt
to death. The facts of the case will best be gathered from a condensed
report of the evidence at the coroner’s inquest, held at the Board Room of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s parish, on the Thursday following the melancholy event.</p>

<p>The jury having viewed the bodies of the unfortunate victims, the first
witness called was Mrs. Anne Tomlins, who identified the bodies as those
of Ruth Lowe, aged 18 years, Martha Caunt, aged 9 years, and Cornelius
Butler Caunt, aged 6 years, the two latter being the children of Benjamin
and Martha Caunt, and the former a cousin of Mrs. Caunt.</p>

<p>Susanna Thorpe was next examined: She said she came to town on
Sunday last, on a visit to Mrs. Caunt, who was her cousin. Mrs. Caunt
and herself were in the bar when the clock struck two on Wednesday
morning, shortly after which they both went upstairs to bed. Ruth Lowe
and the children had gone to bed some hours previously. Mr. Caunt
being away in the country, Mrs. Caunt asked witness to sleep with her.
Witness consented to do so, and had already got into bed herself, when
she heard Edward Noakes, the cellarman, who slept upstairs, give an
alarm. Mrs. Caunt had not got into bed when this happened, and she
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pageno">81</span>
immediately opened the door, and found that the furniture in the middle
room, on the second floor, was on fire. Witness got out of bed, and went
downstairs with Mrs. Caunt to call for assistance. Witness saw fire and
smoke in the middle room as she crossed the landing to go downstairs.</p>

<p>Coroner: Does it occur to you how the fire originated there? No, sir.
I was in that room just before I went to bed. I went to fetch my nightdress,
which I had left on a chair near the window, having slept in this
room on the three previous nights. I had a common candlestick in my
hand when I went into the room. There were two beds in the apartment.
I passed them both, but not closely, and I have no recollection of any
circumstance which might account for the origin of the fire.</p>

<p>Corroborative evidence was given by Edward Noakes, the cellarman and
waiter, by Sarah Martin, the barmaid, and by Dominic Carr, sergeant of
police.</p>

<p>John Short, conductor of the fire escape stationed by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s
Church, proved having attended with his machine immediately after the
alarm was given. He first directed the machine to the second floor
window, through which he entered. He found no person in this room, and
as the fire prevented his getting further, he came down, and having
thrown up the top ladder, reascended to the parapet. He tried to make an
entrance through the parapet window, but the flames and smoke at this
time shot through with such violence that all his efforts were unavailing,
and he again descended. He heard no cries coming from the attic window
while he was there.</p>

<p>The coroner briefly charged the jury. It was a most deplorable case,
but he apprehended, after the testimony they had had from the various
witnesses, the jury would have little difficulty in arriving at a conclusion.</p>

<p>The jury, after consulting for a few moments, found “that the deceased
parties were suffocated in a fire, the origin of which they had no
evidence before them to determine.”</p>

<p>Caunt did not return from the country till the following morning. His
feelings may be more easily conceived than described. Both himself and
his wife were so deeply affected as to excite the commiseration of all
classes.</p>

<p>The last appearance of our ponderous hero in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> was one that
adds no leaf of laurel to his pugilistic biography. Some absurd family
quarrels (Nat Langham had married a relative of Mrs. Caunt), together with
some petty trade jealousy, (Nat being the popular landlord of the “Cambrian
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
Stores,” Castle Street, Leicester Square, hard by Big Ben’s “Coach and
Horses”), gave rise to all sorts of unpleasant personalities on more than
one occasion. Nat, though a civil and, except professionally, non-combative
sort of fellow, having over and over again expressed his opinion that Caunt
had no pretensions to pugilistic honours beyond the possession of unwieldy
bulk and clumsy strength, and further, that “he couldn’t hit him (Nat) in
a month of Sundays,” the feud, aggravated by crabbed old Ben Butler and
Mrs. Caunt, assumed the bitterness of a family feud, and finally Ben
proposed and “Ould Nat” accepted a challenge to settle this “difference
of opinion” in the manner and form prescribed by the fair rules and regulations
of British boxing. The articles were formulated on the 16th of May,
1857, by which, and a deposit of £10 a side, the parties agreed to stake
£200 a side in instalments, the battle to come off on the 23rd of the
ensuing September. It is regrettable to find that the “feud of kindred”
received yet another proof of its exceeding intensity over all ordinary
quarrels among strangers. At the second deposit Nat (he was going out
of town) actually left his £10 with the final stakeholder a week before it
was due, whereon Caunt and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> appealed to the “letter of the articles,” which
declared that the “said deposits should be made at the times and places
hereinafter mentioned,” and claimed forfeit of the money down; although
the “final stakeholder, to whom all deposits should be paid over in time
for insertion in <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>” had actually given notice to “uncle
Butler,” (Caunt being away at Brighton,) of the previous deposit of the
money in his hands. This quibbling plea was, however, repudiated by
Caunt himself, as will be seen below, and the match went on:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p>“<span class="sc">Mr. Editor</span>,&mdash;&#8203;I respectfully ask that you will admit into your columns this declaration
on my part: That my match with Langham is the result of a dispute that can only be
settled, so far as I am concerned, by an appeal to the fists. That the articles will be strictly
abided by on my part, and that so far from throwing any impediment in the way of the
match it is my anxious desire to bring it to an issue in the Ring. Thus far, I beg my friends
will take my assurance of ‘honourable intentions.’ Were they but aware of the personal
nature of the affair, such assurance would not be needed; but, as many must necessarily be
unacquainted with its cause of origin, it is due to my own character to take the course I have
now done in writing to you an emphatic statement of my intentions, which I solemnly assert
are unalterable, until that result comes to pass which shall prove either me or my antagonist
the better man.</p>

<p>The atmosphere thus cleared, all went on serenely, the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fides</span> of the
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pageno">83</span>
match, which had been sorely doubted and even ridiculed in sporting
circles, being now placed beyond dispute. If “there is only one step from
the sublime to the ridiculous,” however many gradations there may be
before arriving at the last step but one, we think the reader will agree that
it was taken by Caunt in the affair we will now briefly relate. In the
month of June Tom Sayers (see Life of <span class="sc">Sayers</span>, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span>) beat the “Old
Tipton Slasher” (Wm. Perry) in a battle for the Championship and the
“Belt,” from all claim to which Caunt had years before publicly retired.
Among the challengers of Sayers’s remarkable position as a 10-stone
Champion we find&mdash;&#8203;<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">risum teneatis, amici?</span>&mdash;&#8203;Caunt, although then engaged

<p>This Waterloo Day flourish of trumpets was followed the next week by
the fearless little Tom covering Big Ben’s “tenner,” announcing that, if
his match with Caunt did not go on, he was prepared to meet his other
challenger, Tom Paddock. The “lame and impotent conclusion” of
Caunt’s challenge is soon told. Ben proposed that Sayers should come to
his house (of course as a “draw”) to draw up articles, &amp;c. Tom didn’t see it;
and as he was engaged in the provinces making hay while the sun shone, he
offered to sign articles, if transmitted to him, and duly post the needful
with the editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>. This, on the other hand, didn’t suit Ben’s
fireside, and so the incongruous affair ended in smoke. Meantime Paddock
had a severe accident, which put his right hand <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</span>, and a
disabling illness followed. Ben now announced his departure for “sea
breezes and strict training,” and Nat did the same, which brings us to
the 22nd day of September, 1857.</p>

<p>As we have already remarked, the match from its first inception was
considered so extraordinary, not only from the great disparity in the size of
the men, but from the supposed irreparable state of Nat’s constitution (he
having, as was known to many, sought the advice of the principal physician
of the Brompton Hospital for Consumption), that the public generally
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">84</span>
looked upon it with distrust and suspicion, and up to the very last deposit
sporting men refused to believe that it would ever come to a fight. Indeed,
so strong was this impression on the minds of many, and not a few of them
influential patrons of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P. R.</abbr>, that they pooh-poohed the whole affair,
absented themselves from the houses where deposits were made good, and
also from the fight itself. Great therefore was their disappointment, and no
less their disgust, when they learnt that not only had the men met, but
that they had actually fought a battle which was certainly as well worth
seeing as almost any modern battle between big men.</p>

<p>Those with whom we conversed appeared to hold but two opinions on
the subject. Either one or the other of the men would be apprehended and
held to bail, or there would be police interference on the day. At one time,
indeed, so infectious is suspicion, we began to participate in the general
distrust, and awaited expectantly the bursting of the bubble, by the news
of a domiciliary visit from Sir Richard Mayne, or some of his satellites,
to one or other of the rival houses; both Caunt and Langham announcing
flying visits to their respective hostelries on more than one occasion. Up
to the eleventh hour this or some other obstacle was confidently predicted.
On the Monday, however, it was known that arrangements had been
agreed on by Dan Dismore on the part of Nat Langham, and Jemmy
Shaw and Ben Butler on the part of Ben Caunt, to hire two steamboats
between them, one for first and the other for second-class passengers.
It was also arranged that the boats should rendezvous at Tilbury, and
that the men and their friends should proceed to the same place by the
7.50 a.m. train on the eventful morning. In the course of Monday, however,
it seems that apprehensions arose in the minds of Nat’s friends that
it would be unsafe to start from Tilbury, and they telegraphed to the
owner of the boats to change the venue and muster at Southend. They
did not seem to think it necessary to communicate with Caunt or his uncle,
concluding of course that they would be at the London terminus at the
time arranged, and that then everything could be settled. At the time
appointed Ben Butler and Young Ben (Caunt’s son) were at Fenchurch
Street, but Caunt did not show, and we thought of course he had adopted
some other means of conveyance. At Tilbury, however, Uncle Ben and
Jemmy Shaw came to us, and said that Caunt expected the boat at Tilbury,
and had not heard of any alteration. Here again our suspicions arose
that some casualty had happened, and that there would be no fight. Ben’s
friends could give no reason for his not being at the appointed station in
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pageno">85</span>
the morning, and all seemed quite nonplused. To add to other difficulties
there were no signs of young Fred Oliver, who, as the deputy of Old
Tom, had charge of the ropes and stakes, although he had distinct notice
on Friday at what time the expedition was to leave London. This state
of things cast a gloom on the travellers, many of whom had serious
thoughts of returning to town. On persuasion, however, they made up
their minds to “see it out,” and as the train could not be stopped, all
resumed their seats and sped on to Southend, hoping to find Caunt there,
or, at any rate, to hear some tidings of him. On reaching this spot all at
once made their way to the pier head, but not a word could be heard of
the ex-Champion, or of the ropes and stakes. Butler at once went on
board one boat (that reserved for first-class passengers), while Dan Dismore
remained on the pier to supply tickets for the voyage.</p>

<p>The party now repaired on board the second-class boat, where Nat was
found installed, waiting impatiently for the appearance of Caunt, of whom
nothing could be heard; Dan Dismore also came on board this vessel.</p>

<p>It was now nearly twelve o’clock, and all began anxiously to look for the
half-hour, at which time the next train was due at Southend, by which it
was, of course, expected that Ben would come. Half-past twelve, one
o’clock arrived, the train had been in some time, but still there was no
appearance of Ben on the pier. At length an emissary was sent ashore, and
he ascertained that Caunt and the ropes and stakes had been embarked on
board an opposition tug, singularly enough called the “Ben Bolt,” at Tilbury,
and that they were on the way to join the flotilla as quickly as possible.
It was two o’clock or nearly so before the “Ben Bolt” hove in sight, with
“’tother Ben” on board. By a quarter-past two o’clock, everything being
settled, the office was given, and an experienced pilot conducted the
flotilla, which now numbered four steamboats, besides innumerable small
craft, to the proposed scene of action, within a very short distance of the
spot where Tom Sayers and Aaron Jones settled their differences. Against
a strong ebb of course progress was very slow, and it was past three before
the first vessel arrived off the point. The ropes and stakes were at once
sent ashore, and Fred Oliver with due diligence proceeded to erect the ring.
Poor Old Tom was sadly missed, and many expressions of regret were
uttered at his continued ill health. The number of persons present was
extremely large, but of Corinthians there was a lamentable absence, arising,
no doubt, from the before-mentioned suspicions as to the men’s intentions.
As soon as the arena was ready, the combatants, who were evidently all
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pageno">86</span>
agog to be at it, tossed their caps into the ring, Nat being the first to
uncover his canister, Ben being not two seconds behind him. Both
looked hard and healthy, but their mugs bore distinct traces of their being
veteran boxers. Ben, of course, looked the older man, his not handsome
dial being as brown as mahogany, and looked as hard as a nutmeg-grater.
Nat’s phiz was smoother, softer, and of a lighter tint, and there was a hue
of health upon it that we had not seen there for many a day. They shook
hands, but it was evident that the ceremony was against the grain. As four
o’clock was fast approaching, it was hinted that no time ought to be lost,
and the men at once proceeded to accomplish their toilettes. Nat Langham
was assisted by the Champion (Tom Sayers) and the accomplished
Jack Macdonald&mdash;&#8203;certainly the best second out&mdash;&#8203;while Ben Caunt was
waited upon (we cannot say picked up, for he never once was down
throughout the fight) by Jack Gill, of Nottingham, and Jemmy Shaw,
who, between them, could never have carried him to his corner, had occasion
required it, in the time allowed between the rounds, indeed they must have
inevitably have carried him a limb at a time. How he could have been
persuaded to select two such assistants we are at a loss to conceive. Jack
Gill could not have had much experience in his new vocation, and Jemmy
Shaw will excuse us for saying that, however staunch a friend and good
fellow he has proved himself in other ways, his stature and proportions by
no means qualify him as a porter to either Gog or Magog, should those
gigantic worthies need to be picked up from a horizontal position.</p>

<p>At a quarter to four the seconds proceeded to knot the colours on the
centre stake&mdash;&#8203;a blue, with white spot, for Langham, orange with a blue
border for Caunt. The betting on the ground was trifling in the extreme;
nothing was laid between the men, and but small sums at 5 and 6 to 4 on
Caunt. As to Nat’s training, he went first to Dover and then to Stockbridge,
in Hampshire, where by steadiness and perseverance he got himself
into extraordinary fettle; to our eye, he looked bigger, stronger, and
healthier, though of course somewhat older, than when he fought either
Harry Orme or Tom Sayers. And now, having brought our men to the
“post,” we will start them for</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On toeing the scratch the
disparity between the men was of course
extraordinary. Ben Caunt, barring his mug,
was a study for a sculptor. His massive
frame and powerful legs and arms&mdash;&#8203;the
former set off to the best advantage by pink
silk stockings and well-made drawers&mdash;&#8203;presented
a sight worth going some distance
to see; and as he stood over old Nat any
one would have agreed with Jerry Noon,
who declared that it was “Chelsea Hospital
to a sentry-box” in his favour. He smiled
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pageno">87</span>
good-humouredly, and had clearly made up
his mind to win in a trot. Nat was, as usual,
clear in skin, and neatly made at all points.
His shoulders and arms were well covered
with muscle, and for an encounter with a
man of his own size he looked all that could
be desired; but as to his being a match for
Ben Caunt it seemed too absurd to be
credited, and few, we think, expected to see
him “perform” with anything like effect.
His attitude, as of yore, was perfection, and
his dangerous left was playing about close
to his side all in readiness for one of his neat
deliveries as Ben came in. Caunt stood
just as he ever stood, very square on his
pins, his brawny arms almost straight out
before him, which he ever and anon
moved backward and forward with all the
deliberation of a couple of pendulums. He
had come, however, not to spar, but to
fight, and after very little feinting he went
up to Nat, who retreated towards the ropes,
and Ben at length lunged out left and right,
just catching Nat with the former on the
ribs, and Nat was down laughing.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Both very quick to time. Caunt
walked after Nat, sawing the air with both
fins, and as he got close he sent out his left,
but Nat, quick as lightning, shot out his
left on the kisser, drawing <em>first blood</em> from
Ben’s upper lip and got down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;After a little dodging Nat feinted,
and then let fly his left straight on the jaw.
Slight exchanges followed on the side of the
wig block, and Nat was again down out of
harm’s way.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;No time cut to waste, Caunt went to
his man and poked out his left, just catching
Nat on the chin, and Nat dropped.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Nat fiddled Ben to within distance,
and then popped his larboard daddle on
Ben’s jaw, a cracker; this led to heavy
exchanges, Caunt getting on to Nat’s forehead
above the left peeper, and receiving on
the cheek; Nat fell.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;After one or two passes the men got
close, and very slight exchanges took place,
when Nat got down by a roll over.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt stalked up to Nat, swung his
mauleys slowly round, and then dropped
the left on Nat’s left cheek, Nat nailing him
prettily at the same time on the left eye;
Nat down clumsily, Caunt carefully stepping
over him.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt again approached Nat, and
lunged out his left, Nat countering him
quickly on the right peeper. Ben got home
on the left cheek, and Nat fell.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Nat dodged about for an opening, and
then got sharply home on the left cheek.
Caunt returned very slightly on the side of
the nut, and Nat was down.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Both sparred a little for wind, but
soon went to close quarters, when, after a
very slight exchange on the forehead, Nat
sought Mother Earth. The 11th round was
precisely similar, Caunt missing with both
hands.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Nat, after a few passes, got within
distance and shot out his left as straight as
a dart on Ben’s conk, inflicting an ugly cut
on the bridge, and drawing more claret. The
blow had double force from the fact that
Ben was coming in at the time. He, nevertheless,
bored in, and had Nat down at the
ropes.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Nat again timed his man judgmatically
with his left on the proboscis, and
slipped down from the force of the blow.
He recovered himself, however, and after a
little sparring got sharply on Ben’s potato-trap.
Ben retaliated, but not effectively,
on Nat’s cheek, and Nat fell.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Nat feinted, and dropped smartly on
the snorer. He tried again, but missed, and
in getting away slipped down.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Langham missed his left, and slight
exchanges followed at the ropes, where Nat
got down, Caunt again, in the most manly
way, refraining from falling on him, as he
might have done as he was going down.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Ben took the first move, and got
home, but not heavily, on Nat’s jaw. They
then sparred a bit, and on getting close
Caunt lunged out his one, two, on Nat’s left
cheek, but the blows appeared to have no
steam in them. Nat popped a straight one
on the left brow, and dropped.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Slight exchanges, no damage, and
Ben bored his man down at the ropes.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Nat let fly his left, but Ben was too
far off. Ben, however, went to him, and
slight exchanges took place, Nat on the mark
and Caunt on the side of the head, and Nat
down.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;After slight exchanges, Ben got home
sharply on the back of Nat’s brain pan, and
Nat fell.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;No time lost. They walked up to
one another, and at once let fly, Caunt on
Nat’s forehead, and Nat on the left brow.
Nat down.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Good exchanges, but Nat straightest,
getting another good one on Ben’s conk, and
renewing the crimson distillation. Caunt
touched Nat’s forehead, and Nat down without
a visible mark of punishment.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt rushed at Nat, who being
close to the ropes, slipped down. An appeal
of “foul” was made, but not by the umpires.
The referee, however, sent Nat’s umpire to
him to caution him.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Nat fiddled and dodged until Caunt
drew back his arm, when pop went the left
on Ben’s cheek. Exchanges followed, Nat
getting on Ben’s left peeper, and Ben on the
brow, and Nat down.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Slight exchanges; Ben on the forehead,
and Nat down.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Nat missed his first delivery, but in
a second effort caught Ben on the body,
Caunt retaliating with a swinging round hit
on the cranium, and Nat down.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Sharp exchanges; Nat on the kisser,
and Ben on the side of the canister, and
Nat down, Ben as usual stepping over him,
but asking him why he “did not stand up
and have a round.”
</p>
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Ben went to his man, and began
business by lunging out both hands, but he
missed, and Nat popped his left on the
whistler. Ben, however, returned on the
cheek, just drawing claret, and Nat down.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Ben again succeeded in reaching
Nat’s cheek with his right, drawing the
ruby, and Nat fell.</p>

<p>     29 and 30.&mdash;&#8203;After trifling exchanges in
these rounds, Nat got down, much to the
annoyance of Ben, who, however, preserved
his good temper, and merely remonstrated
with his cunning opponent.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Nat dodged, and popped his left
sharply on the mazzard, received the merest
excuse for a blow, and dropped.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;In this round the exchanges were
very slight, but Nat’s were straightest. As
usual, he was down.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;Nat crept in, let go his left on Ben’s
lip, which he cut, and Nat fell on his back
from the force of his own blow.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Ben, whose warbler was bleeding,
rushed at Nat furiously, and regularly bored
him down.</p>

<p>     To go into details of the next few rounds
would be merely a repetition of what we
have already written. Nat feinted, dodged,
timed his man with the greatest precision
whenever he moved his arms, and, although
his blows did not seem very heavy, they still
were always “there, or thereabouts,” and
poor old Ben’s mug began to be all shapes.
The manly fellow, however, never grumbled;
he went straight up to be planted upon, and
although he occasionally got home a body
blow or a round hit on the side of Nat’s
knowledge box, still he left no visible
marks. Once or twice Jemmy Shaw claimed
“foul,” on the ground that Nat fell without
a blow; but Nat was cunning enough to
keep just within the pale of the law. There
was not one round in which he did not go
down, and Ben invariably walked to his
corner. In the 43rd round Ben got the first
knock-down blow on Nat’s forehead. In
the 48th, he bustled in with desperation, but
Nat met him full in the mouth, and then on
the snorter, with his left, drawing the
crimson from each, Ben returned on the
top of the forehead, and Nat got down.</p>

<p>     49.&mdash;&#8203;Nat crept in craftily, and popped a
little one on the snuffer-tray, and this led to
a tremendous counter-hit, Caunt on the
cheek, and Nat on the jaw very heavily,
drawing more ruby. Nat fell, his nut first
reaching the ground, and Ben staggered to
his corner, evidently all abroad. By great
exertions, and a little extra time, his seconds
got him up to the scratch. Nat, however,
was not in a much better state. Both were
severely shaken.</p>

<p>     50.&mdash;&#8203;Nat on coming up, was evidently
slow, but, to the surprise of every one,
showed no mark of the hit in the last round,
while Ben’s kisser was considerably awry,
and he was scarcely himself. Now would
have been Langham’s time, but he had not
strength to go in. After a short spar, Ben
got on to Nat’s jaw, staggering him; Nat
returned sharply on the left eye and nozzle.
After heavy exchanges on the body, Nat
fell.</p>

<p>     51.&mdash;&#8203;In this round Ben just missed Nat as
he was falling, and caught the stake very
heavily with his left, which was thereby
rendered useless, or nearly so. From this to
the 60th and last round there was nothing
to call for particular notice. Nat pursued
his defensive tactics, and his pop for nothing
when there was a chance. Still, however,
old Ben kept swinging his dangerous limbs
about, and every now and then got heavily
on Nat’s body and left shoulder, and occasionally
on the top of his head. Nat fell
every round, but oftentimes be had to do it
so quickly, owing to the close proximity of
Ben, that he fell most awkwardly for himself,
and must have been shaken severely.
He gradually got tired, and Caunt, whose
dial was much cut about, was evidently
puzzled what to be at. At length, in the
sixtieth round, after a little sparring and a
slight exchange, they stood and looked at
one another, and rubbed their chests.
Neither seemed disposed to begin, and it
was pretty clear that each had the same
end in view&mdash;&#8203;namely, to protract the battle
until it was dark. Each, doubtless, felt that
he was unable to finish that day, and did
not feel disposed to throw a chance away by
going in, and getting an unexpected finisher
at close quarters. After standing several
minutes, Dan Dismore came to us and said
it was a pity that men who had been such
close friends should proceed any further
with hostilities, and suggested that it would
be much better if they forgave and forgot
their quarrel, and shook hands. We coincided
with Dan in his kindly opinion, and he then
took upon himself to go into the ring and
suggest some such arrangement, and in doing
so he said he would gladly give £5 out of his
own pocket to see them bury their animosity
there and then, and draw their stakes.
Caunt said he was willing if Nat was, and
after a little consideration Nat held out his
mauley, which was cordially shaken by
Ben, and then Langham went with Caunt
into the corner of the latter, where he
shook hands with Ben Butler, and also with
Caunt’s son. Dan Dismore now left the
ring, and on the referee asking him what
had been done, Dan said, “It is all over;
it’s settled.” The referee inquired whether
they intended drawing altogether, and Dan
said again, “It’s all done with; there will
be nothing more done in it;” or words to
that effect, but we believe these were Dan’s
exact expressions. The referee at once, on
hearing this, expressed his pleasure at so
amicable an arrangement, and on the men
quitting the arena he also left the ring side,
his office of course ceasing, and on the faith
of Dan’s statement he at once gave up what
bets he held. After being some time on
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">89</span>
board the boat, however, he was somewhat
staggered at being accosted by one of Nat’s
Corinthian patrons and Jack Macdonald,
who told him that Nat was quite astonished
when they had mentioned to him that a
draw had been agreed to, and had declared
that such a thing never entered his head.
He thought Dismore merely wished them to
draw for the time being, and that the
referee would name another day in the same
week to fight again. The referee replied
that his impression certainly was that an
arrangement had been made to draw stakes,
or he should not have vacated his post, and
this application on Nat’s behalf took him so
much by surprise that he did not know how
his position was affected. It was a case
that had never occurred before, and he
must think it over. Nat’s backer said he
also was impressed at the time with the
notion that everything was arranged, and
had left the ring side with that belief, but
still he thought the referee had the power
to name another day, as Nat had been no
party to any final arrangement. At the
railway station, on the arrival of the boats,
the referee called both the men together,
and asked them in the presence of each
other what they had understood on leaving
the ring. Caunt said he understood they
were friends again, and were to draw their
money, while Nat repeated the statement
that had been conveyed to the referee by
Jack Macdonald. Caunt seemed quite taken
aback, as did also his friends. Dan Dismore
now came up, and repeated the statement
that he had previously made, to the effect
that he had recommended the men to shake
hands and be friends, and that he had certainly
said he would give £5 out of his own
pocket to see the matter settled. They had
shaken hands at his recommendation, and
at the time it certainly had been his impression
that they would not fight again.
He declined, however, to take upon himself
the responsibility of saying that either man
had actually said anything about drawing
stakes. The referee was now completely
nonplused, and said, at that time, and in such
a crowd, he could not undertake to give an
opinion either way. He then suggested that
the men and their friends should meet at the
Stakeholder’s office the following day to
discuss the matter, when all were calm, and
had had time to think over the affair.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Owing to the low state of the tide when the fight was over, and the narrowness
of the causeway to the boats, a great deal of time was lost in
embarkation, and not a few of the travellers obtained mud baths at much
less price than such a luxury would have cost in Germany. The consequence
of the delay was, that the 8 o’clock train was missed, and there
being no other until 9.30, the travellers, weary, muddy, and wet, but
tolerably well satisfied with their entertainment, did not reach the Metropolis
until twelve o’clock.</p>

<p>The following morning the referee took the opportunity of laying the
case before a Corinthian patron of the art, who, although no longer a frequenter
of the Ring side, was for many years one of the staunchest attendants.
That gentleman, after thinking the matter over for a few minutes,
said he was of opinion there could be no doubt as to the course of the
referee. There had been, he said, no appeal to him to stop the fight&mdash;&#8203;there
was no reason for his interference, as he could see both men perfectly,
and he had stated there was sufficient daylight for eight or ten
more rounds. The men had shaken hands in the ring, and, putting Dismore
and his statement out of the question as unnecessary adjuncts to the
case, he was of opinion that the men, by voluntarily quitting the ring
without any appeal being made by themselves or their umpires, had clearly
taken the whole affair out of the referee’s hands, and altogether deprived
him of any power in the matter.
</p>
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pageno">90</span>

<p>At the appointed hour both men and their friends were in attendance&mdash;&#8203;Nat
all but scatheless, while Ben had an ugly cut on his nose, and his left
peeper was partially closed. He had also other severe marks of punishment
on various parts of his dial, and his hands were much puffed. Both
men made their statements. Caunt repeated that he fully believed Nat
had agreed to draw stakes when he shook hands with him and his uncle,
or he should never have consented to leave off fighting, as there was still
daylight for ten or a dozen rounds. He was then warm, and felt confident
he could have won. He was as strong as ever on his legs, and was
convinced that Nat had done all he knew. Langham, in reply, denied
that this was the case. He understood that Dismore only proposed a
postponement until another day, as it was not likely they could finish that
evening. He shook hands with Caunt and his uncle because he did not
think he ought to leave the ring without performing that ceremony. Dan
Dismore repeated the statement he had already made, adding, that he certainly
was not authorised to say they had agreed to draw their money,
whatever his own impression might have been. He was of opinion then
that it would have been a proper course, and that opinion he still entertained;
and he would willingly give £5 or £10 out of his own pocket to
see them shake hands and make up their differences. Tom Sayers, who
was also present, said he had left the ring with the idea that his principal
had agreed to draw the money, and he had no idea until some time afterwards
that Nat had contemplated a renewal of hostilities. The referee,
after hearing both sides, said that he had thought the matter over very
carefully, and had come to a conclusion in his own mind, before consulting
the gentleman above referred to, and he was glad to find that conclusion
coincided with the opinion of his adviser. The men had taken the matter
quite out of his hands. They had made an arrangement between themselves,
had shaken hands and left the ring without asking his opinion,
or appealing to him in any way, although he stood close to the ropes and
stakes at the time they were shaking hands, and what other conclusion
could he arrive at than that they had amicably settled their differences?
That a misunderstanding had arisen as to future arrangements was to be
regretted, but he had no power whatever to name another day. If his
advice were asked it would be that they should shake hands, but if they
did not choose to do this, they must agree upon another day and place
between themselves. Nat at once proposed fighting again on Saturday, to
which Caunt objected. He said he was now stiff, and his hands were
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pageno">91</span>
injured, and required time to get round. He believed a bone in one of his
fingers was broken. As he had before said, he could have finished it the
same night, but he should decline agreeing to fight again at present. Nat
then asked what he proposed, to which Ben said he proposed that on the
next occasion Nat should stand up and fight like a man. He could not
fight a man who was always on the ground. A good deal of angry discussion
followed, Ben Butler again going beyond the bounds of decorum,
while Caunt remained perfectly quiet. Nat was, of course, incensed at
being baulked of his rights, as he considered them, but still there was no
prospect of an arrangement. At length Nat asked Caunt to give him some
portion of the stakes, as an inducement to draw, a proposition indignantly
scouted by Caunt. This was the last offer. The men were then informed
that the referee had given his decision, that he could not interfere, and
it remained for them to agree between themselves upon a time and
place.</p>

<p>Having gone so fully into details of this affair, it will be unnecessary for
us to make many remarks either upon the respective styles of the combatants
or the untoward result of the battle. Caunt, from first to last,
showed not the slightest improvement in his style of fighting; nor was it
likely that after a life of ease, and of abstinence from athletic exercises (if
from nothing else) the case could have been otherwise. His position was
unartistic. He held his arms too high, and never displayed the least head
or judgment in his efforts to get at his shifty opponent. He was always
too quick and too anxious to be doing something, and thereby threw away
many chances, and so put himself at the mercy of the crafty Nat, who
seldom or never failed to avail himself of Big Ben’s incautiousness.
Unartistic as he was, however, no one will deny that Caunt upheld the
character he has invariably borne of a manly upright boxer, disdaining to
avail himself of repeated opportunities, which many persons would unscrupulously
have adopted, of falling on an opponent when he dropped in the
not very manly manner that Nat, on many occasions, certainly did. From
first to last Ben never lost his temper. He received all Nat’s props with
the greatest <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span>, smiling upon him, and sometimes shaking his head
at him for his shiftiness. As to Caunt’s game, there never was, and never
can be, a question. He was punished most severely, and yet he never once
flinched or showed signs of not liking it. The only remark he condescended
to make from time to time in his corner was, that Nat had done all he
could, and that he must be getting weak. He did not wish to win by a
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pageno">92</span>
foul, and on several occasions when his seconds desired to appeal he said
he would rather try to win on his merits. In addition to the punishment
on his mug, he contrived to seriously injure both hands. Of Nat Langham
it is not necessary to say much. As we have before remarked, he was
fitter to fight than we thought he ever could be, and was as confident as if
all had been settled. There was all the old cunning and extraordinary
quickness with his left, and, if possible, he had improved both in his powers
of timing his props and his judgment of distance. He, like Caunt, never
for a moment flinched from his receipts, which, on many occasions, must
have been anything but agreeable; and, so long as he stood on his pins,
he faced his man with unruffled indifference.</p>

<p>That he went down on many occasions in a suspicious manner cannot be
denied, and that this occurred on some few occasions when he was not in
danger is equally true; but he almost invariably kept just within the pale
of the law. Several times he was hit, and hit severely, and when Jemmy
Shaw appealed to the referee as to his falling, on most such occasions he
received a gentle tap, just sufficient to save him; still he persevered in
the practice much too constantly to admit of our stating that it was a fair
stand-up fight on his part. His friends contend that when a man is
opposed to such superior weight and strength he is justified in resorting to
such shifts to enable him to withstand his opponent, but this we deny.
The rules of the Ring say distinctly “it shall be a fair stand-up fight,” and
if a man cannot vanquish an opponent of heavier metal than himself by
fair means, he has no business to make a match with him. Nat knew perfectly
well Caunt’s superiority in height and weight, and Caunt was perfectly
justified in his observation that this knowledge ought to have deterred him
from match-making except on the usual terms. That Nat’s shifty tactics
arose from cowardice would of course be a ridiculous suggestion. Every
one who has seen him fight knows that a braver man never pulled off his
shirt, and no one we ever saw enter a ring has impressed us with so just an
idea of what may be accomplished by science and judgment; but still we
cannot help repeating a remark we have over and over again made&mdash;&#8203;we do
not and cannot admire the hit and drop system. It is not consonant with
the principles on which, and on which alone, we can uphold British boxing.
The fight lasted one hour and twenty-nine minutes.</p>

<p>The floodgates of newspaper letter-writing were opened by this undecided
encounter. It is needless to say that the controversy ended in much ink-shedding
and a draw of the £400 staked, leaving the debateable question
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pageno">93</span>
of “getting down to finish the round” much where it previously and
subsequently stood.</p>

<p>From this period Caunt may be said to have finally retired from the Ring,
though he still kept his house, the “Coach and Horses” (now the “Salisbury
Stores”), in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s Lane. The parlour here was a general resort
of aspirants for pugilistic honours and their patrons, Ben busying himself in
bringing forward and occasionally backing or finding backers for men,
among whom may be named Bob Caunt,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_13" id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span>
his brother, David Hayes (thrice
beaten by Murray), Perry, the Black, who beat Burton, of Leicester
(January 20th, 1846), George Gutteridge (beaten by Nat Langham, September
23rd, 1846), and others.</p>

<p>Caunt was also well known as no mean performer at pigeons, on the
various club grounds near the Metropolis and in Hertfordshire. Having
caught a severe cold in a long day’s match at “the doves,” in the early
part of 1860, it settled on his lungs, and coupled with late hours, and the
free living inseparable from his calling as a publican, gave the powerful
pugilist his final knock-down blow on the tenth day of September, 1861.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="h4head">JAMES BURKE (KNOWN AS “THE DEAF’UN”).<br />
1828&ndash;1843.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">No</span> one who reads with attention the chequered career of James Burke
will deny that “The Deaf’un” deserves to rank as one of the most honest,
courageous, hardy, simple-minded, and eccentric fellows who ever sought
praise and profit in the Prize Ring. Jem was the son of a Thames waterman
who plied at the Strand Lane stairs. Left at an early age to the charge
of a widowed mother, young Jem betook himself to the amphibious calling
of “Jack-in-the-Water,” at the stairs where his father once plied with his
“trim-built wherry.” At the time of which we write, before steam-boats,
with their gangways and ugly dumb-lighters (the latter to give way yet later
to a noble embankment with its broad granite-stepped landing places) had
superseded the “caus’eys,” and “old stairs,” from Wapping to Westminster,
the favourite and popular mode of transit of the dwellers in Cockaigne
to Lambeth, to the glories of Vauxhall with its <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">al fresco</span> concerts and 30,00
(additional) lamps; to Cumberland Gardens, with its trellised tea-boxes, and
“little gold and silver fish that wagged their little tails;” to the Red House,
Battersea, with its gardens and pigeon shooting; to “Chelsea Ferry,” with
its elm-bordered promenade and Soldiers’ Home, and to the numerous places
of riverside resort, was by “oars or sculls,” plied by the brawny arms of the
“firemen-watermen,” one of the most laborious and deserving fraternities
who devoted their well-earned and well-paid services to the pleasure-seeking
public who patronised the broad highway of the Thames. The popularity
and consequent prosperity of the stalwart “firemen-watermen” (for most
of them wore the handsome coat and badge of, and were retained by, one or
other of the great London Insurance Offices, and were the only organised
body for the extinguishing of fires and saving of life) extended to the
humble “Jack-in-the-Water,” whose duty consisted in wading bare-legged
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pageno">95</span>
into the rippling tide, dragging the sharp nose of the wherry on to the
paved causeway, or by its pile-protected side, and there steadying it, while
the “jolly young waterman” politely handed his “fare” over the rocking
“thwarts” of his smart, light boat to his or her cushioned seat in the
“stern-sheets.” For his services in thus holding on, and thereby securing
the balance of the staggering land-lubbers, for a pair of “sea-legs” were
never included in the cockney’s qualifications, “poor Jack” seldom went
unrewarded by one or more “coppers,” for we had not then come to the
“age of bronze.” This humble and weather-beaten calling was by no
means an unprofitable one to a hardy, handy, and industrious lad, such
as young Jem Burke undoubtedly was.</p>

<p>The date of Jem’s birth was Dec. 8th, 1809, in the closing years of the
“war of giants,” and in his earlier days London was alive with war excitement;
with processions on the Thames of the gilded and bannered barges
of the Corporation and the public companies, with gaily painted pinnaces,
shallops, and house-boats, aquatic fireworks and illuminations, and galas in
honour of our victories in Portugal and Spain; to say nothing of frequent
grand doings along the then bright river on all sorts of City “gaudy” days.
It was moreover the line of procession on the 9th of November and other
times when my Lord Mayor went in state to Westminster; and of continually
recurring wager matches of skill and strength for prizes given by citizens,
public bodies, and aquatic clubs, for the encouragement of the Thames
watermen “between the bridges.” All these have vanished with the crowds
who enjoyed them. The “fireman-waterman” is as extinct as the dodo.
The half-penny or penny steam-boat of an utilitarian age has “improved
him off the face of the earth,” and the picturesque silver Thames runs a paddle-churned
<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">cloaca maxima</span> of the great towns in its upper course, by the stately
buildings of our Palaces of Parliament and Palatial Hospital, sweeping by
where once Strand Lane stairs offered itself as a convenient outlet for “taking
the water,” along a spacious embankment, with its leafy avenues, bordered
by lofty stone-built public edifices. Far different the Thames by which the
young Deaf’un earned his “crust,” and added to the poor comforts of a widowed
mother. Then the merry-makings we have above alluded to made the miscalled
silent highway a lively and populous show-scene, to the profit of such
snappers-up of unconsidered trifles as our “poor Jack,” whose Christian name
was Jem. As to the “schooling” of our hero&mdash;&#8203;for a hero he unquestionably
was&mdash;&#8203;it amounted to that sort of general knowledge which could be picked up
in that “university” which Mr. Samuel Weller declares to be the best for
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pageno">96</span>
sharpening a boy’s wits&mdash;&#8203;the streets. The Society for the Diffusion of
Useful Knowledge as yet was not; the “schoolmaster” was altogether
“abroad,” in the wrong sense; and the Briarean School-board had not yet
“comprehended all vagrom” boys and girls, and taught them the “three R’s”
in spite of their teeth. “Reading, ’riting, and ’rithmetic” not being in
the curriculum of young Jem’s “’varsity,” he was perfectly innocent of
those accomplishments, despite Dogberry’s assertion that to “read and write
comes by nature,” though at figures, we can certify from our own personal converse,
the Deaf’un had, on special occasions, an almost intuitive aptitude.
His knowledge too, upon out-of-the-way subjects, was occasionally surprising;
he had much “mother-wit,” a quaint felicity of expression, a sly
touch of humour, and a quiet stolidity of look and manner, the outcome
of his infirmity of deafness, which amused the hearer, from the
apparently unconscious humour with which his comical notions were set
forth. Of Jem’s physical powers and muscular endowments, the story of
his Ring performances in after years will sufficiently speak.</p>

<p>Thus the young “Jack-in-the-Water,” like Topsy, “grow’d,” and we
need not say he was well furnished in these respects to take his own part
in the very rough “battle of life” to which he was from his earliest
infancy introduced.</p>

<p>That the future Candidate for the Championship, born and bred in those
“fighting days,” when Gully and Gregson, Belcher and Cribb, were on
every tongue, should have yearnings to “improve his gifts,” as the goody-goody
books express it, was but a natural sequence to what philosopher
Square calls “the eternal fitness of things.” Hard by the Strand Lane
stairs stood a well-frequented public-house, known as “The Spotted Dog,”
the landlord of which was an ex-pugilist of no mean renown, hight “Joe
Parish, the Waterman.” What wonder, that Joe’s judicious eye noted
the good “points” in the sturdy little “Jack-in-the Water’s” build and
disposition, and that he befriended the boatman’s orphan, patting his head
as he warmed his chilled hands by the tap-room fire, where he dried his always
damp and scanty clothing, and, as the Deaf’un himself has told us, saying,
“You go straight, Jemmy, and we’ll see if you won’t be a topsawyer
among ’em yet”? This early patronage by Joe Parish, as we shall see
hereafter, continued down to Burke’s latest days, a fact creditable to both
parties.</p>

<p>A passing remark on the pugilistic eminence of watermen may here be
in place. Jack Broughton, the Father of the Ring, was a waterman;
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pageno">97</span>
as also was Lyons, who beat Darts for the Championship in 1769; while,
passing over many boxers who plied the oar, the names of Bishop Sharpe,
Harris, “The Waterman,” Harry Jones, and the Deaf’un’s “guide, philosopher,
and friend,” Joe Parish, occur to us. No wonder, then, that on
the 5th of February, 1828, young Jem Burke, under the wing of old Joe,
was by the ring-side at Whetstone, near Barnet, an admiring spectator of
the eccentric battle which there and then took place between a couple of
dwarfs; one a Welshman named David Morgan, a vendor of shrimps and
shell fish well known in various sporting and other public-houses, and the
other Sandy M’Bean, a Scotch professor of the Highland bagpipes and the
“fling.” After a ludicrous display of bantam game, Taffy was declared
the conqueror, the second of the canny Scot carrying him out of the ring
<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">vi et armis</span>, in spite of his protestations that he “wasna beaten ava’,”
though the poor little fellow had not the ghost of a chance.</p>

<p>And now there was a pause, and a purse of £14 being collected, Ned
Murphy (who had already fought M’Carthy, and a commoner or two),
presented himself as a candidate for the coin. Our hero (who, doubtless,
knew something of the challenger), eager of the opportunity of showing
the stuff he was made of, at once, with the approval of Joe Parish, stepped
into the ropes, and threw down his cap as a reply. No time was wasted
in elaborate toilettes, and the ring being cleared, all eyes were bent on the
“big fight” of the day, which, on this occasion, was presented as the
afterpiece. Mister Murphy was so cock-sure of the money, and so eager
to win, that he went off at score to polish off “the boy” for his presumption.
Not only was his gallop stopped by some clever straight ’uns
from the resolute young Jack, helped by an occasional upper-cut as he
went in, but he, in turn, was fain to stand out, and retreat to “draw” his
opponent. Young Jem, however, was not to be had twice at this game,
and Mister Murphy not quite liking the look of the job, began to fight for
darkness, which was fast coming on. Harry Jones, who was picking up
Murphy as a “pal,” seeing the dubious state of affairs, stepped up to the
referee and asked a “draw.” The men had now fought 50 rounds in the
like number of minutes, and were quite capable, if they were of the same
sort as the last dozen, of fighting 50 more; so the Young’un was persuaded
to “whack” the stakes, and make up matters over a pot and a pipe at
“The Spotted Dog,” by which arrangement Mr. Murphy got the “half
a loaf” which is proverbially “better than no bread,” while the young
“Jack-on-the-water” was in the seventh heaven of delight, not only at
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pageno">98</span>
his success (for he felt he must win), but at the possession of several golden
portraits of His Majesty George the Fourth, of a value which to him
seemed to vie with the fabulous treasures of Aladdin’s cave.</p>

<p>Jem was now “a card,” not only at the Strand Lane <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirées</span>, but was a
free and accepted brother at all the sporting cribs in the hundred of Drury,
Wild Street, the pugnacious purlieus of Clare Market, and among the
“porterhood” of Covent Garden. Those were rough times, and among other
rough entertainments the “rough music” of the butchers of Clare Market
was not the least popular. Their marrow-bones and cleavers were always
ready to “discourse” loud, if not “sweet music,” upon occasions of a
wedding, a birth, or a christening among their own fraternity, or when any
popular or well-known inhabitant took unto himself a wife. Foremost in
these charivaris was one Tom Hands, who further had the reputation
of being “sudden in quarrel,” and with him and the Deaf’un there had
passed a sharp round or two at one of these uproarious gatherings, which
had ended in their being separated by their friends.</p>

<p>On August 14th, 1828, Ned Stockman and Sweeney were matched to fight
at Old Oak Common; the affair being arranged at a dinner at Alec Reid’s,
at Chelsea. The ring was pitched, the expectant crowd assembled, and
“time” was called. Peter Sweeney showed in battle array, but where was the
“Lively Kid”? and echo answered “where?” He didn’t show at all, and a
forfeit of the stake being then and there declared, his representative urged as
a reason for what Sweeney called “making a fool of the public,” that
Stockman “preferred his match with Harry Jones” (in which he was
deservedly thrashed on September 16th, 1828). As the day’s draw thus
proved a blank, and the meet could hardly separate without sport of some
kind, a whip was made for an impromptu fight. The hat went round, and
the cash being gathered by Alec Reid and the renowned Frosty-faced
Fogo, a hint from one of the Clare Market Guild of Kill-Bulls that Tom
Hands would like to cross hands with Jem Burke, there and then, if the
namesake of “the author of The Sublime and Beautiful” dared face him,
was at once seized with avidity. A shout went up from a hundred lungs
as the burly butcher, his hair shiny with grease, and his cheeks red as a
peony, drew his blue smock over his head and proceeded to divest himself
of his upper clothing; nor was “poor Jack” without friends. Behind him
stood Joe Parish and Alec Reid; Hands being seconded by Sweeney and a
Clare Market amateur. The fight was a sad exposé of Tom Hands’ want
of skill in the opening, and lack of what a slaughterman never should
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pageno">99</span>
be deficient in&mdash;&#8203;pluck. The Deaf’un, who looked hard as iron and solid as
the trunk of a tree, fought the first three or four rounds on the retreat,
jobbing the butcher fearfully, and bleeding him from every vein of his
fleshy jowl; then, having got him down to his own weight, he reversed the
process, and fought him all over the ring so effectively that in the 10th
round, 17 minutes only having elapsed, Hands’ second threw up the sponge
in token of defeat, the butcher being terribly punished, while the Deaf’un
was scarcely marked.</p>

<p>Indeed the effects of this encounter could not have seriously affected
him, seeing that, on the day but one afterwards, namely on August 16th,
the Deaf’un was again on Old Oak Common, to witness the battle between
Mike Driscoll and Pat M’Donnell. This affair disposed of, a new Black
offered himself “under distinguished patronage,” as the advertisements say,
to box anyone for “a purse.” The Deaf’un, always ready, slipped modestly
into the ring, announcing to Mike Brookery, the M.C. on this occasion,
that he should like to be “introduced” to Massa Sambo for the next
dance. The affair was a mere farce. The black had but one qualification,
that of a first-rate receiver; as a paymaster he was nowhere. After rushing
in head down a dozen times, and getting upper cuts and sound right-handers
on the ear innumerable, he rolled down for the last time at the
close of thirty-three minutes, declaring “Me can’t fight no more,” and
the purse was handed to the Deaf’un.</p>

<p>In 1829, the Deaf’un, who was now regularly enrolled in the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps pugilistique</span>,
was with a sparring party in the Midlands, where, in the month of
March, the great contest between Jem Ward and Simon Byrne was to come
off near Leicester. The reader will find this fiasco, known as “The
Leicester Hoax,” in its proper place in our second volume. On the 10th of
March, 1829, an immense gathering from all parts of the kingdom was
assembled at Leicester; and the great event having ended in smoke, and Bill
Atkinson, of Nottingham, having beaten Joe Randall, in the ring prepared
for the big’un’s, the day being yet young, a purse was collected. For this
a big countryman named Berridge, of Thormaston, offered to “try conclusions.”
The Deaf’un joined issue, and a smart battle ensued. The
countryman was so overmatched that after 22 minutes, in which 11 rounds
were got through, each ending by Berridge being hit down or thrown, his
backers took him away, and Burke walked off with the 10 sovereigns.</p>

<p>Burke was now matched with Fitzmaurice (an Irishman nearly 13 stone,
who subsequently defeated Brennan and Tim Crawley), for £25 a side, to
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">100</span>
come off on Epsom Racecourse in May; the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</span> was prevented by
police interference, and the affair postponed to June 9th, 1829.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span>
That day
being appointed for the fight between Ned Savage and Davis (the Black),
at Harpenden Common, near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s, it was arranged that the Deaf’un
and Fitzmaurice should follow those worthies. It was fortunate for the
travellers who went to see the first-named fight that the Deaf’un and Fitz.
were in reserve, for the affair of Savage and the bit of ebony proved
“a sell;” and so the second couple were on the turf in good time, and in a
well-kept and well-ordered ring. Young Dutch Sam and Gaynor, who
had come down with Savage, volunteered to second Fitzmaurice. On
standing up Fitz. loomed large in height and length, but a survey of the
sturdy Deaf’un, his firm attitude and compact strength, brought the
betting to even. We shall not attempt to detail the fight, which extended
to no less than 166 rounds, fought under a burning sun, and lasting two
hours and fifty-five minutes. There was some clever stopping in the
earlier portion of the battle on the part of the Deaf’un, but he could not
reduce the strength of Fitzmaurice, and he himself became exhausted.
After the 70th round the fight became a question of endurance; the
Deaf’un at the end of the rounds lying on his stomach on the turf to get wind,
declining to be picked up by his seconds, kicking up his heels in a comical
manner, and declaring himself “all right,” in reply to their anxious inquiries.
On these occasions Young Dutch Sam and Gaynor, knowing the
“blown” condition of their man, cunningly kept prolonging the “time”
between the rounds, Fitzmaurice generally getting down, and the Deaf’un
almost always rolling across, over, or beside him. About the 150th round both
men were nearly incapable of delivering a hit, and Fitz. was more than once
out of time, but the Deaf’un went in again, and so condoned the offence.
At last, at the end of the time mentioned, Fitz. fell in his own corner from a
left-handed poke; the sponge was thrown up, after as game and
scrambling a fight as could well be imagined, and the Deaf’un was hailed
the victor. Burke in a few minutes walked to his carriage, while poor
Fitz. was conveyed to Wildbore’s, the “Blue Boar,” <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s.</p>

<p>At the Deaf’un’s benefit, on the following Wednesday week, Fitzmaurice
was unable to put on the gloves as promised, but Young Dutch Sam did
so. Although the Deaf’un was certainly a foil to show off the brilliancy of
Sam, that accomplished boxer was somewhat mortified at the improved
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pageno">101</span>
style of Burke, who more than once gave him an opening in order to send in
a clever return; keeping his temper so unruffled that loud applause followed
his exertions. Indeed not a few of the “knowing ones” expressed their
opinion that the Deaf’un would yet puzzle some of the “fashionable”
12-stone men.</p>

<p>About this time, as we learn incidentally from the report of his next
battle, the Deaf’un met with a serious accident&mdash;&#8203;a rupture&mdash;&#8203;for which he
received surgical treatment, and was compelled to wear a truss. Nevertheless,
we find him in August under an engagement to fight Bill Cousens,
who is described in <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> as a fine, fresh young Chichester man (who
had already beaten Tom Sweeney and “the Cheshire Hero”), on the
25th of August, on which day they met at Whetstone. Tom Oliver and
Frosty-faced Fogo were the M.C.’s, and we are told the “crowd was considerable.
Swells and scavengers, drags and dust-carts,” conveying the
motley groups to the scene of action. Cousens was seconded by
Tom Oliver and a “Sussex friend,” Burke by Ned Stockman and
Sweeney. The weather was again intensely hot. Cousens had the
advantage in length of reach and height, and a trifle in weight.
Cousens, though receiving most punishment, had it all his own way in
throwing, and several times gave the Deaf’un such desperate falls, that
the battle was supposed to be at an end; but the Deaf’un’s hardy frame
seemed to resist all vicissitudes, and he came again and again; on one
occasion, about the middle of the fight, so flooring Cousens that the odds
went round to 2 to 1 on the Deaf’un. In the 95th round, Cousens got the
Deaf’un on the ropes, and kept him there until the stake and rope gave
way. The Deaf’un would not leave off, though advised to do so, when
Reuben Martin stepped into the ring and threw up his hat in favour of
Cousens, and the Deaf’un was withdrawn from the ring, after fighting 101
rounds in two hours and three minutes. The reporter says, “it was stated
that Burke was suffering from the effects of a rupture.”</p>

<p>That this was not, at that time, of a very serious nature may be
inferred from the fact, that the Deaf’un finished up 1829 by balancing
this, his only defeat, with yet another victory. On December 1st all the
pugilistic world was on the move into Sussex to witness the great (second)
fight between Ned Neale and Young Dutch Sam for £220 to £200,
which came to nought, owing to the arrest of Neale on his way to the
battle-field on a warrant issued by Mr. Chambers. Sore was the disappointment
and loud the complaints of the hundreds who had left London on
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">102</span>
this hog-shearing expedition, as they surrounded the admirably formed
ring at North Chapel, Sussex, and were told that there would be “no
fight,” as Messrs. Ruthven and Pople, two “active and intelligent
officers,” as the penny-a-liners styled them, had grabbed Neale, and were
so strict in their attentions that they had declined to lose sight of him;
indeed, they had at once carried him off in a postchaise to the great
Metropolis. Harry Holt stepped forward, and addressing “the inner
circle and boxes” (the latter represented by several four-in-hand drags
and hired wagons), proposed “a collection.” Sam also presented himself
amidst applause, rattling some coin in a hat. The money-matter was
soon arranged, a big countryman named Girdler stepping into the
ropes, and laying claim to the guerdon against all comers. In a few
seconds the well-known, hardy mug of the Deaf’un was seen as he made
his way through the crowd, and, amidst some cheering, declared that “he
didn’t minds a shy at that chaps, if he did lose his sticks,” while Girdler,
who had many country friends, said with a grin, “He knowed all about
Mister Burke, and didn’t care a varden for ’un.” To give éclat to the
affair, Jem Ward and Fogo offered themselves to second the Deaf’un,
whereon Young Sam and Cicero Holt volunteered to wait upon the
countryman.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Girdler was certainly, as Sam
said, “big enough for anything,” and when
be threw his hands up, did it in a style that
showed he was not the mere yokel he had
been supposed. The Deaf’un looked as
serious and as stolid as a pig in a pound,
and as solid as a stump of a tree. He
nodded at his opponent, and pointed down
to the scratch, to which Girdler at once advanced,
and the Deaf’un went a step back
smiling. Girdler let fly his left; it was a
little too high, but just reached the Deaf’un’s
nut, who returned on Girdler’s cheek sharply;
heavy exchanges, in which Burke hit
oftenest and last, and both were down on
hands and knees. (6 to 4 on the Deaf’un.)</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un trying to get his distance
hit short with the left; Girdler stopped
his right, and popped in a sounding
crack with his own right on the Deaf’un’s
ribs, who broke away. (“Bravo!” cried
Holt, “do that again for me.”) The Deaf’un
grinned, licked his lips, and looked down
slyly at his opponent’s feet. “Don’t be gammoned,”
cried Young Sam. The advice
came too late. Girdler rushed in, Burke
popped his head aside, and the blow went
over his shoulder, the countryman at the
same instant receiving such a straight one
in the mouth, followed by another over the
left eyebrow, that he was brought up “all
standing,” while the Deaf’un slipped down
from his own blows. There was no mistake
about the claim of first blood.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;In went Girdler like a bull at a gate.
The Deaf’un, not clever enough to prevent
him getting on a sort of pole-axe, hit on his
impenetrable nob, from which we think the
countryman’s knuckles suffered most. Burke
hit up, but couldn’t this time stop his man,
who bored him to the ropes, and got him
down in a scrambling rally.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Girdler again first; but this time
Burke stopped him with one, two, and a
ding-dong rally ensued, in which Girdler
was first on the grass, blowing like a porpoise.</p>

<p>     5, 6, 7, 8.&mdash;&#8203;Sam cheering on his man, who
answered the call cheerfully, but always got
two for one in the rally, and in the 8th
round fell over the Deaf’un’s leg on his face
so violently that Ward cried out to Holt to
take his man away. “Take your man away,”
retorted Holt; “he can’t beat mine in a
week.”</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Girdler came up game, but went in
without any aim or precision; the Deaf’un
propped him again and again, and at last
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">103</span>
ran in and threw him a burster. (Cheers for
the Deaf’un.)</p>

<p>     10, 11, 12.&mdash;&#8203;A one-sided game. Girdler
down at the end of each round against his
will, and beaten by his own exertions.</p>

<p>     13, 14, 15.&mdash;&#8203;Girdler merely staggered up
to be hit, and finally went down fearfully
punished.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Girdler came once more and made a
wild rush; the Deaf’un stepped aside, and
sending in his one, two, on the side of the
countryman’s head, he fell over anyhow.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Cries of “take him away!” from the
Londoners; but Girdler would not have it,
and was indulged with one more round, which
ended in his being floored in the hitting;
whereupon Holt stepped across the ring
and beckoned the Deaf’un, who at once crossed
and shook hands with his brave but almost
insensible antagonist. Time, 89 minutes.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>The immense assembly now dispersed, the roads being soon alive,
especially that which led towards Chichester and London. On one of the
four-in-hands was seated “White-headed Bob” (Ned Baldwin), then in
the full sunshine of aristocratic patronage. Bob had spent the overnight,
or rather the morning, at the Monday masquerade, then in vogue at “His
Majesty’s Theatre,” in the Haymarket, and donning a most remarkable
suite of grey moustaches, whiskers, and beard, the resemblance to the then
Duke of Cumberland was perfect. As the populace recognised the
counterfeit of the unpopular Duke, the fun was uproarious. Pulling up at
the “King’s Arms,” mine host hurried out with a decanter of sherry, a waiter
following with champagne. H.R.H. cried out, “No, thankee, waiter, the
Duke will take something short!” The schnapps was supplied. “I’m
glad to see ye, my people,” said His Royal Highness, “but d&mdash;&mdash;e if I like
this stopping of fights; when I come next this way I’ll give you a turn,
and if there’s no one else to fight, I’ll make one in a fight myself! Drive
on, coachee!” And off went His Royal Highness in what the poet Bunn
called “a blaze of triumph.”</p>

<p>The topsawyers of the top-weights of the day set their public appearances
at too high a figure for the poor, unsophisticated Deaf’un to obtain any
hearing for his modest proposal to fight any 12 or 12½ stone man for £25
a side, so he sparred at benefits and at the fairs and tennis courts, and hung
about looking for a job until September, 1830, when Gow, who had beaten
Ned Savage in December, 1829, offered himself to the Deaf’un’s notice,
and articles were signed for a meeting on October 5th. The toss being
won by Gow, he named Woolwich, and thither all parties repaired. There,
however, they found Superintendent Miller, of the Thames Police, with
sundry row-boats, and off they moved into Essex; but they could not shake
off the anti-milling Miller, who, calling on a couple of beaks, pursued the
excursionists towards Leytonstone, reinforced by the “Essex lions.” A
council was held, which decided that as the game was “U.P.” in
Essex, a retreat to Temple Mills across the border into Middlesex was the
only chance of a quiet meeting. A “horrid whisper” went round that
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">104</span>
Superintendent Miller had a warrant from the magistrates at Snaresbrook,
and that two active constables were already on the track. Jack Carter,
changing coat, hat, and handkerchief with the Deaf’un, with the quickness
of a clown in a transformation scene, took the Deaf’un’s seat in a one-horse
chaise, while both of the men made the best of their way towards
Temple Mills. The ruse succeeded. Carter was yet a mile from the
Essex frontier, when up rode a couple of mounted men, quickly followed
by a posse of the amphibious Thames constables, and called upon the driver
of the gig to “Stop, in the King’s name,” which he loyally and dutifully
did, and away poor Carter was haled before the nearest beak, and his capture
officially announced to the worshipful functionary. The culprit was brought
forward. “James Burke,” said the awful representative of Majesty, reading
the warrant, “it is my duty to commit you for a contemplated breach of
the peace within this county of Essex&mdash;&mdash;” “Excuse me, sir,” interposed
Jack, “my name isn’t Burke at all, and why these here gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;”
“Then what is your name?” “I can save your worship trouble,”
said Superintendent Miller. “I know this man well; his name is Jack
Carter, and if I’d been at hand I shouldn’t have mistaken him.” “You
are discharged, fellow,” exclaimed his worship, indignantly, and away
went Jack, with a low bow to his crestfallen captors. At the bridge at
Temple Mills the pursuit ceased, and all got over the river Lea.</p>

<p>The fight that now took place presented no features worth recording. The
Deaf’un, who had always a touch of eccentricity, on this occasion appeared in
the ring in a grotesque and original costume. His “nether bulk” was encased
in a pair of green baize drawers, profusely bound and seamed with yellow
braid, and with flying yellow ribbons at the knees, below which his sturdy
pedestals were encased in a pair of bright striped worsted stockings and
laced highlows. Although the day was waning, Burke managed to polish
off his job before dark, Gow never getting a lead during 22 busy rounds,
at the end of which his second, Birmingham Davis (who, as will be seen
afterwards, fought the Deaf’un), claimed the fight for Burke, Gow not
answering to the call of “Time.”</p>

<p>In the interim, before this affair with Gow, a curious incident illustrates
the readiness of the Deaf’un, who was then always in training, to “do
business at the shortest notice.” Bob Hampson, of Liverpool, visited
London, where his fame as the conqueror of one Jack Pye, and subsequently
of Wm. Edwards, at Bootle, and Bill Fisher, at Milbray Island, had gone
before him. Bob offered himself, at £25 a side, to the notice of Burke;
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pageno">105</span>
who expressed himself ready, as the Liverpool carpenter wanted to return
northwards, to meet him at an early day as might be convenient. Two
fights were “on the slate” for the 26th of the current month, one between
Sam Hinton and the Bristol baker (Mike Davis), the other between the
youthful Owen Swift, and an East End Israelite, of the name of Isaacs. To
these the Deaf’un and Hampson were added, and all were satisfactorily
got off at Harpenden Common on the same day.</p>

<p>Hampson, with these credentials, was the favourite at 6 and 7 to 4.
Indeed, the chance of the Deaf’un looked by no means “rosy,” yet he
never lost heart or confidence. Hampson came down to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s under
the wing of Tom Spring; to whose care he was recommended by no less
a person than Jack Langan, Spring’s former foe, but now fast friend.
Hampson came on the ground with Tom Oliver and Harry Jones as his
seconds, the Deaf’un attended by Fitzmaurice (a former opponent) and
Ned Stockman.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;As the men stood up Hampson
did not impress the London connoisseurs
favourably, either as to his boxing skill or
his capability for rough work and endurance.
He looked leggy, stood wide, and fidgeted,
rather than manœuvred, in an anxious and
hurried manner, while the Deaf’un, who was
the picture of sturdy health, stood firmly
facing him, eyeing him sharply, and only
just moving so much as to prevent his opponent
from stealing a march on him either
to right or left. The Liverpool man, after
some dodging, let fly his left and caught
Burke a tidy smack on the cheek, but got a
return on the mouth from the Deaf’un’s left,
which more than balanced the account. A
brief spar, when Hampson again was first,
and reached the Deaf’un’s nob. This led to
a smart exchange of blows, Hampson delivering
several snowy hits on Burke’s dial,
which, however, left hardly a visible mark,
while the Deaf’un’s returns seemed to paint
and flush the countryman. In the close
Hampson got the Deaf’un’s head under his
left arm cleverly, and hit up, but he couldn’t
hold him, and Burke lifted him over and
threw him an awkward side fall. (Cheers
for the Deaf’un, but no offers.)</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Hampson again let off with the left,
but was met with a counterhit, and Burke
forced a rally; some sharp half-arm hitting
at close quarters, in which the Deaf’un
showed most strength. In the close both
down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Hampson came up bleeding from the
mouth and nose, and Burke seemed to have
damaged his left hand. Hampson hammered
away, and hit for hit was the order of the
day. The men closed, and after a struggle
both were down. (Even betting.)</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;A short round. Hampson led off, but
his blows left scarcely a mark, and after a
break and some manœuvring Hampson slipped
down.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Counterhits with the left. Burke the
best of the exchanges. Hampson the quicker
fighter, but Burke the steadier and harder
hitter. A long rally and no flinching till
Hampson fell on his knees; Burke walking
to his corner.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Hampson dodging about and feinting
with the left, the Deaf’un solid as a post,
but moving his arms defensively. Hampson
got in a smack with his left, which the
Deaf’un countered, but not effectively.
More weaving work, hit for hit, a close,
Hampson thrown heavily. (6 to 4 on Burke.)</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Hampson seemed a little lame, and
sparred for wind; Burke waiting. The
Liverpool man, as before, let fly with the
left, and reached Burke’s head just above
the left eye, stopping the Deaf’un’s return
neatly, amidst applause. The Deaf’un
shook his wig-block and grinned. Hampson
tried it again, and got such a return from
Burke’s right in his ribs that he fell on his
knees, but was quickly up again, and renewed
the round in a lively manner, until
the Deaf’un closed and threw him over his
hip by a heave. (Applause.)</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Hampson came up blowing and coughed
two or three times. He was evidently shaken
by the last throw. He however kept in good
form and led off. Burke shifted a little and
retreated, but, biding his time, met Hampson
with a fearful jobbing hit on the mouth
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pageno">106</span>
that staggered him; Hampson returned to
the charge and hit away wildly, and once
and again the Deaf’un nailed him. This was
not done without damage, for Hampson
caught him with his right on the ear such a
wax-melter, that if the Deaf’un could have
been cured by that process he might have
heard better for some time afterwards. A
close embrace, in which neither man could
get a hit, ended by Burke pulling Hampson
down; both on the ground, blowing like
grampuses.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;The last struggle had told most upon
Hampson. He was distressed, while the
Deaf’un might be described as “much the
same as usual.” Hampson pointed to the
scratch as they met, Burke shook his head,
grinned, toed it, and then made half a step
back as Hampson tried a feint with his left.
Hampson once more led off, and there were
some sharp exchanges. The Deaf’un nodded
to Stockman as he got away, and Hampson
did not follow, saying, “He can’t hit me
hard enough, Mister Neds.” “I believe you,
my boy,” replied the Lively Kid. Hampson
again got on Burke’s nob, receiving a rib-roaster.
Hampson was first down.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Hampson made play, but the Deaf’un
met him, and hit for hit was once more
persevered in until Burke threw Hampson
after a short wrestle.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;The Carpenter showed marks of severe
punishment, and the Deaf’un’s cast-iron frontispiece
was ornamented with some crimson
patches and bumps. Hampson was evidently
less inclined to go to his man, and worked
round him <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la distance</span>. The Deaf’un, with
a comical grin, in turn pointed down to the
scratch with his right hand forefinger;
Hampson seized the opportunity, as he
thought, and hit straight at Burke’s head,
who, quick as lightning, countered with his
left on Hampson’s jaw. “Bravo!” cried
Stockman, “I’d have told him to do that,
only he can’t hear me.” The men were at
it again, when Burke drove Hampson on
the ropes and chopped him with the right.
Hampson rolled down (7 to 4 on Burke).</p>

<p>     12, 13, 14, 15.&mdash;&#8203;Hampson came up game,
and fought for a turn, but his confidence
was gone, and the Deaf’un timed him, now
and then putting in an ugly one, and ending
the round by getting Hampson down.</p>

<p>     16&ndash;20.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un still declined to
lead off, but always had the best at close
quarters. In the last named round Hampson
dropped on his knees in the hitting, and
the Deaf’un threw up his hands, bowed
comically to the spectators, and walked to
his corner. (Cheers.)</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Hampson, encouraged by his friends,
fought vigorously, and at one time seemed
to have got a turn; in the close the Deaf’un
was under. (Shouts for Hampson.)</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Hampson appeared to have got second
wind; he manœuvred round his man, and
delivered one, two, neatly. The Deaf’un
laughed and shook his head, but was short in
the return. “That’s the way,” cried Harry
Jones, “he’s as stupid as a pig. Hit him
again, Bob, he’ll stand it.” Hampson did so,
but the Deaf’un countered, and then went
in for close work. Hampson could not keep
him out, and was forced back on the ropes,
where the Deaf’un hit him heavily until he
got him down anyhow.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Hampson much shaken by the last
round; Burke waiting. “Why don’t you
go in, Jem?” shouted Reuben Martin, “it’s
all your own.” The Deaf’un nodded, and
did as he was bid. The advice was not good,
for Hampson nailed him sharply right and
left, and in a rally Burke over-reached himself,
missed his right, and slipped down.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Some amusement was created by the
Deaf’un’s evident attempt at <em>gammoning</em>
distress, to induce his opponent to come on.
Hampson, however, fought shy. After some
sparring they got closer, and again give-and-take
was the order of the day, the <em>pepper-box</em>
being freely handed from one side to the
other. Hampson was thrown, but not
heavily.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;The tide was turned against Hampson.
He retreated before the Deaf’un, who now
assumed the offensive, and in a rally the
Liverpool man was fairly hit down in his own
corner.</p>

<p>     26&ndash;40.&mdash;&#8203;In all these rounds it was clear
that Hampson’s defeat was a mere question
of time. In the 40th round he was thrown
heavily, and his friends proposed to give in
for him; he, however, refused, and came up
for the 41st round, when Burke hit him on
to the rope, and then let him get down,
walking away to his own corner. Hampson’s
backer stepped into the ring and desired the
sponge to be thrown up, saying it was useless
to expose a brave man to further punishment.
Time 44 minutes. The Deaf’un crossed the
ring, shook hands with his opponent, and
then indulged in a sort of hornpipe-step in
his own corner, putting on his clothes with
little assistance. Hampson was carried to
his carriage, severely punished, complaining
that he lost his power of wrestling from an
injury to his leg in the 5th round.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;This battle tells its own tale.
The Liverpool man’s friends had much overestimated
Hampson’s scientific attainments,
and equally miscalculated his opponent’s
cunning defence, backed as it was by extraordinary
powers of endurance, indomitable
pluck, and cool courage. “Hampson was, up
to a certain point, the cleverer man, but, that
point passed, his chance was gone, and he
was beaten by toughness, readiness, and
strength. The Deaf’un by this battle has
shown himself a dangerous competitor for
any 12-stone man on the list. He is now the
winner of seven fights, mostly with big men,
and must not be meddled with by any mere
sparrer. However flash and wide-awake he
may think himself, he will find the Deaf’un
knows a thing or two that will astonish him
when it comes to real work. The 200 and
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pageno">107</span>
300-pounders, though ‘great guns,’ will do
well to take our hint.” These last remarks,
which we transcribe from a contemporary
sporting paper, show the good opinion which
Burke was fast gaining among the most
competent judges of boxing merit. Of course
the 200 and 300 pounders mean the men who
fixed £200 or £300 as the price for a Ring
appearance.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>We have just seen that our hero fought and won two sharp battles
within three weeks, and we have now to record yet another arduous conflict
within the three weeks next ensuing, namely, on November 16th, 1830,
on which day he met Tim Crawley at the well-fought field of Whetstone,
for a stake of £50.</p>

<p>Mister Timothy was a stalwart Milesian coalwhipper, aged twenty-three,
hard upon six feet in height, and balancing 13 stone, and though no
relation to “Peter the Great,” was only a shade less than the fighting weight
and stature of that ponderous ex-champion. Tim was “presented at the
Castle,” not of Dublin, but in Holborn, by a distinguished Hibernian
field-officer, who intimated to Tom Spring his readiness to post the “needful”
for Tim in a trial with any man Spring might select. There was the
Deaf’un, rough and ready, “standing idle in the market place;” and as he said,
when he was asked as to when he would be ready if a match were arranged,
“Well, you see, Misters, I’se ready at any time&mdash;&#8203;the sooner the better&mdash;&#8203;but
where’s the moneys to come from? I’ll put down five of my own, buts&mdash;&mdash;”
a well-known member of the Stock Exchange struck in immediately, “and
I’ll find the second five, and perhaps some more, if it’s wanted.” So the
articles were there and then drawn, and Tuesday, the 16th, set down.</p>

<p>East Barnet was the fixture, and on the appointed morning, despite a
heavy storm of wind and rain, a numerous cavalcade thronged the roads
from Finchley and Southgate to the rendezvous. Crawley came down in a
brand-new white upper-benjamin, on the swell drag of his military patron.
Tim was radiant, if the weather was gloomy, and assured his friends that
“He thought mighty little of Misther Burke’s foightin”&mdash;&#8203;(Tim had seen
his battle with Hampson)&mdash;&#8203;“if all he could do was what he did with that
tumble down carpenther from Liverpool. By jabers,” he added, “I’m the
boy that’ll tache him quite another sort o’ fun.” The storm increased in
violence, the time was come, and all were waiting with what patience they
could command. Crawley alighted from his vehicle and claimed the stakes,
when Reuben Martin hastened up breathless and covered with mud, to
announce that the Deaf’un would be there immediately. The Deaf’un had
left Soho in a hired gig; the horse had proved a “bolter,” and after a
gallop along the Finchley Road, and up a bye-lane into which he had been
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pageno">108</span>
turned, had smashed the gig and deposited the Deaf’un and his pal in a
clayey ditch, the former pitching on his head with no other damage than a
mud-bath. The Deaf’un now hove in sight, attended by Welsh Davis
(afterwards called “Birmingham”) and Ned Stockman; Crawley had the
services of Harry Jones and an Irish “friend.” The colours were tied to
the stakes, the ring whipped out, and amid a pelting shower of rain the
men stood up for</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Crawley stood over the Deaf’un
by at least three inches, and topped him in
weight by about a stone. He was, indeed,
a fine muscular specimen of humanity, though
some critical anatomists pronounced him too
thick about the shoulder-blades, and, therefore,
what is technically termed “shoulder-tied,”
a defect which detracts both from the
distance and the quickness of a man’s blows.
The Deaf’un’s solid, trunk-of-tree look, was
by this time familiar to all ring-goers, as he
stood with his comparatively short arms, the
left slightly in advance, and the right across
covering his side and mark. Crawley lost
no time in letting his adversary know his
“little game,” for in he went, swinging out
his left arm rather than hitting straight, and
following it with a lunge with the right,
both of which would have been ugly visitations
had they got well home; but the first
was stopped, and the second only just reached
the Deaf’un’s ribs as he shifted ground;
Crawley followed up his charge with more
round hits, or rather misses, in exchange for
which the Deaf’un, getting within his guard,
hit up so sharply, the right on Tim’s eye and
the left on his mouth, that he paused a
moment before he renewed his hitting out.
The Deaf’un had broke away, and now led
Mister Tim a short dance round the ring,
during which he propped the big ’un several
times. Crawley lost his temper, and made
a furious grab at Burke with his open right
hand, catching him round the neck, when,
to the surprise of all, the Deaf’un, throwing
his arms round Crawley’s waist and butting
him in the breast with his head, heeled him
and threw him a clear back fall, adding his
own weight to the concussion, which would
have been far more serious but for the fact
that the ground was about the consistency of
a half-baked Yorkshire pudding. (2 to 1 on
Burke.)</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Crawley came up with his face painted
the colour of the sign of the “Red Lion,”
and the claim of first blood for the Deaf’un
was admitted. Tim was, however, nothing
daunted, and smiled contemptuously at his
opponent, who nodded his nob in reply.
At it again went Tim, in the style which we
at a later day recognised as peculiar to Ben
Caunt, whom Crawley (though better looking
and not so tall) much resembled in his bust
and mode of hitting. The onslaught was
again but partially successful, the Deaf’un
hitting up at close quarters with unusual
precision, while Mister Tim pummelled
away, often at the back of Burke’s head,
neck, and shoulders, until they closely embraced,
when the Deaf’un got his man down
somehow.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Crawley came up strong on his pins,
but already much disfigured. His left eye
was nearly closed, his lips swelled and bleeding,
and his cheek-bones and forehead full
of “bubukles, and knobs, and whelks;”
yet he went to work as before. After a stop
or two, the Deaf’un again got his length,
and sent in a smasher on Crawley’s damaged
kissing organ, but could not escape such a
right-handed “polthogue” from Tim’s bunch-of-fives
on the top of his head as sent him
staggering across the ring, amidst the shouts
of the Emerald party. Crawley tried to
follow up his advantage, but the Deaf’un
recovered himself, was “all there” after
a few exchanges, and finished the round by
slipping through Crawley’s hands as he tried
to grab him at the ropes.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;A short round. Burke’s nob again
visited; a rally in favour of the Deaf’un and
both down.</p>

<p>     5, 6, and 7.&mdash;&#8203;Very similar. Crawley showing
increasing signs of punishment; the
Deaf’un’s left ear tremendously swelled, and
some blue marks about his frontispiece. In
a rally Crawley missed his right and struck
it flush against the stake. Burke was
undermost in the last-named round.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Crawley, a deplorable spectacle, rushed
in and got jobbed severely; in the close
Burke threw Crawley heavily. Tim had no
pretence to wrestling skill, and his right
hand seemed almost <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</span> from
contact with Burke’s granite skull and the
oaken stake.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Crawley nearly dark in one window,
and the other with the shutter half-up. The
Deaf’un now went in in turn. He allowed
Crawley to get on his favourite right at
the ribs, jumping aside at the moment with
a quick step, and sending his own right as
a return smash into poor Tim’s frontispiece.
Ding-dong till both out of breath and Crawley
down.</p>

<p>     10&ndash;25.&mdash;&#8203;The whole of these rounds were
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pageno">109</span>
too much alike to deserve particular description.
They varied only in which of the
men finished the round by being first down
at the close, and in this Crawley scored a
large majority. In the 25th round Crawley’s
remaining daylight became so nearly darkened
that his last chance seemed gone.
General Barton asked him to leave off, but
he refused, saying, “Sure, yer hanner, an’
I can bate that fellow yet.” So he was
indulged in seven more short rounds, and
then, at the thirty-third, being in total darkness,
his backers withdrew him after a slogging
battle of 30 minutes only!</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Each time the Deaf’un appears
in the ring, he surprises us by his
manifest improvement. True, Crawley
turned out a perfect novice, still the Deaf’un’s
style of hitting, stopping, and getting away
from a powerful and determined assailant
was a clever demonstration of the art of
defence; while the way, when the time came,
in which he adminstered pepper with both
hands at close quarters was something astonishing.
Burke walked to his conveyance;
he declared himself little hurt by Crawley’s
body blows. Poor Tim was carried to his
patron’s drag, and was soon conversable.
He declared, no doubt with truth, that he
“Couldn’t for the life of him make out how
he was bate, at all, at all, no more nor a
babby.” Some of the fancy suggested that
the great Irish champion, Simon Byrne,
with whom Jem Ward’s fiasco of Leicester
was yet rankling in the public mind, might
find his match in the Deaf’un; but this was
not yet to be.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>The sky had how cleared and the wind abated, when some fun was
promised by a proposed fight between two well-known eccentric characters
in the fistic world. These were no other than the facetious Tommy Roundhead,
the trainer, and in after-time the “Secretary” to Deaf Burke, and
the renowned Frosty-faced Fogo, D.C.G. (Deputy Commissary General),
C.P.M. (Chief Purveyor of Max), and P.L.P.R. (Poet Laureate to the
Prize Ring), for all these honours had been conferred on him by the Press.
These illustrious wights had it seems differed (so it is rumoured) about the
etymology of a Greek verb, the use of the digamma, or the literary attainments
of Jack Scroggins; and in one branch of the disputation
Tommy had not only asserted his own superiority in prose and
poetry to the Laureate, but had offered to back Scroggins against him
in writing blank verse or hexameters. Fired at the insult, the Frosty-faced’un
tipped Tommy such a volley of <em>black (letter) chaff</em> that the latter
declared himself quiet dumb-founded and <em>nonplushed</em>; so he offered to
post five bob, and to fight Fogo in the same ring as Burke and Tim
Crawley, just to settle the knotty dispute. Frosty’s official duties having
ceased with the exit from the ring of the two principals, the Deputy
Commissary stepped into the middle of the ring, and “thrice called aloud
for Richmond” (we beg pardon, Roundhead). Before, however, he was
“hoarse with calling” Roundhead, Tommy appeared, ready stripped to the
waist, hopping through the mud like a pelted frog. Shouts of laughter
greeted his entrée to the ropes, and at once he of the Frosty-face, hearing
his defiance answered, began (unlike the Homeric heroes) to divest
himself of his panoply, and would have been quickly in his natural buff
suit, had not the ring filled with curious inquirers, anxious to learn the cause
of this unusual commotion. The matter explained, the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">literati</span> (represented
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pageno">110</span>
by the ring-reporters), the University wranglers, and the aristocracy of the
<abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, decided unanimously and with one voice (remember it was “raining
cats and dogs”) that it would be derogatory for so distinguished a votary
of Apollo to descend from Parnassus to roll his laurelled brow in Middlesex
mud. “Forbid it, Phœbus, and ye Muses nine!” exclaimed Cicero Holt,
then, descending to plain prose, he added, “Come, shove on your toggery,
Frosty-face, you’ll catch cold, you old muff;” and, suiting the action to
the word, he tried to thrust the “pen-hand” of the irate bard into the
ragged sleeve-lining of his “upper Ben.” The task was impracticable.
“There’s five bob down, and I’ll have a round for it,” cried the Fancy
Orpheus. “Oh, d&mdash;&mdash; your five bob, Frosty, we’ll make that right,”
cried half-a-dozen voices. At that moment poor Frosty beheld with
dismay the greasy sleeve of his old coat torn clean out at the shoulder, and
his own naked arm protruding from the yawning rent. He felt like</p>

<p class="unindent">so he cried for quarter; and being reassured that he would be indemnified
for the five bob, and “leave the ring without a stain on his character,” as
the police reporters have it, he was appeased, pocketed the affront (and the
five shillings), and straightway, with assistance, returned to his chariot (a
South Mimms farmer’s cart), in charge of his true-blue stakes, his ditto
beetle, staples, tent-pegs, and neatly-coiled cordage. As for Tommy
Roundhead, after calling the gods to witness his readiness to do battle, he
waxed less pugnacious, and quickly “lost stomach for the fight” when he
was told the victorious party (to which his principal and he belonged), had
a dinner waiting at the “Blue Boar,” of which he was invited to partake.
The rain had now come on again, and as Apollo was appeased, no one
cared to expose himself any longer to the anger of Jupiter Pluvius, and all
who had the means, got as quickly housed as possible; the pedestrians
plodding their weary way through slush and mire to their humble homes,
the equestrians rattling home to their more luxurious domiciles.</p>

<p>Hampson challenged the Deaf’un to fight for £50, within 30 miles of
Liverpool, but the affair fell through.</p>

<p>The Deaf’un now came out with a challenge to any 12-stone man and
upwards (bar Jem Ward), dating from Reuben Martin’s, in Berwick Street.
This was promptly answered on the part of Birmingham (Welsh) Davis,
who declared his £100 ready, if necessary. The match was, however,
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pageno">111</span>
made for £50 a side on December 16th, 1830, “to fight within four
months.” In <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> of December 26th, 1830, we read, <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</span> of a
discussion of the merits of heavy weight exhibitors at the benefits at the
Fives Court, and the sparring of Ned Neale, Young Dutch Sam, Tom
Gaynor, <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> “The Deaf’un was transformed into a swell, but had not
lost his civility, as do too many of his calling. He was never known to
utter an oath or an offensive word to any one, and has established the
character of a good-natured, well-meaning fellow.” Of how few men in
most positions in life could this be written truly!</p>

<p>February 22nd, 1831, was the day, and Baldwin having won the toss
for Davis, named Knowle Hill, near Maidenhead, the spot where he
(White-headed Bob) beat George Cooper. Baldwin had forgotten that
Sir Gilbert East had “departed this life,” and that his place was filled by
an anti-millarian justice. Davis, with Arthur Matthewson and Perkins,
the Oxford Pet, reached Maidenhead on Monday, and there also arrived
Jem Burn, Reuben Marten, Burke, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum multis aliis</span>. At an early hour
Tom Oliver and Fogo were on the move to Knowle Hill with their
<span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</span>, when they spied three mounted men in the distance. “My mind
misgives me sore. By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this
way comes!” quoth Fogo. The horsemen approached. “S’help me,”
said Tom Oliver, “they’re beaks to a sartinty; I don’t like the Jerusalem
cut of the first one.” And Tom was right. Up rode Sir Maurice Ximenes.
“My good men,” said Sir Maurice, “if you don’t want to get into trouble
you’ll clear out of both Berkshire and Wilts. Myself and these two gentlemen
have determined to suffer no breach of the peace in our jurisdiction.
Go back at once to your party and tell them so.” Tom</p>

<p>“In course, yer worshup,” said the Commissary, “nobody would think of
goin’ agenst yer worshup’s orders.” And he turned the head of his nag
towards whence he came, muttering something very like a witch’s
prayer for the Semitic nose and Israelitish carcase of his worship. All
now were in motion for the Bush Inn, Staines, and, arrived there, Shepperton
Range, in <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> Middlesex, was decided on. Burke, Reuben
Marten, Stockman and company were on the ground in good time, but
Davis was delayed by the overturning of his post-chaise between Windsor
and Egham, through the clumsiness of his driver. It was, therefore, full
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pageno">112</span>
two o’clock before he arrived, when no time was lost in preliminaries.
Burke was seconded by Stockman and Reuben Marten, Davis by Harry
Jones and Perkins. The colours being tied to the stake, and umpires and
referee chosen, at the cry of “Fall back! Fall back!” and the crack of
the ringkeepers’ whips, all settled themselves down, and the men began</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Both men set to in good form,
and covered their vulnerable points well.
Davis looked brown, strong, and hardy,
his trade of a coachsmith being one well
calculated to promote muscular development.
The Deaf’un was paler than usual,
though he looked bright and confident.
There was a sly looseness about the Deaf’un’s
action that seemed intended to induce the
Brum to go in. Davis tried a nobber with
the left, but Burke got away smiling. More
shifting and Davis let go his right at the
Deaf’un’s ribs, and his left at his head; the
former Burke caught on his elbow, the
latter got home sharply, and exchanges
followed. The Deaf’un broke away, counter-hits
and a close, in which the Deaf’un
gained the fall. A most determined first
round, with as much fighting as half a dozen
first rounds of our modern sparring professors.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Davis bleeding from the nose and a
cut on the left cheekbone. The Welshman
got on a heavy smack on the Deaf’un’s eye,
which twinkled and blinked again. Burke
shook his head and hemm’d twice or thrice.
“He don’t like it,” cried Harry Jones, “do it
again.” Davis tried to do so, but was stopped
neatly. Mutual stopping and shifting,
until the Deaf’un balanced accounts by a
straight’un on Davis’s left ogle that seemed
to electrify him for the instant. Both men
now got at it ding-dong. Davis staggered
once or twice from the heavy hits, but
recovered and went on again. At last
Burke drove Davis into his corner and hit
him down. (First knock down for the
Deaf’un.)</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Davis flushed, but still strong, fresh,
and active. Deaf’un hit short to draw his
man, and then sent in a cross counter as
Davis hit out with his left. A rally. Davis
fought fast and furious; a close and Davis
under in the fall.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Heavy hitting and a bustling round.
Jack as good as his master, and not a pin to
choose. Towards the close Burke’s heavier
metal told, and both were down, blowing;
Davis undermost.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Fast work and bellows to mend. A
terrific round. Counter-hits; give and take
and no mistake; Davis determined to get
the lead, and Burke resisting his assaults
like a brick wall. At last Davis closed,
but after a brief struggle the Deaf’un flung
him a clear cross-buttock, poor Davis’s legs
whirling in the air like the revolving spokes
of a coach wheel.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Davis slow from his corner, but did
not appear to be so much shaken by the
last round as was expected. This was a
very short bout. Davis retreated, and the
Deaf’un went in; exchanges, and Davis
down in his own corner.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un, sly as a ’possum, would
not go over the scratch, but kept throwing
out first one elbow, then the other, with a
funny little jerk, and looking his adversary
all over with a kind of self-satisfied grin on
his stoneware mug, as much as to say,
“Let’s see what you are going to do next,”
to which poor Davis certainly did not seem
able to give any practical answer. He, too,
shifted from side to side, then taking courage
from despair, in he went, Burke jumping
back from his first delivery, and each of
their left hands coming “bash,” as a bystander
expressed it, in the other’s face.
Some more left-arm hitting, both men as
game as pebbles, Burke’s broadsides the
heavier, and poor Davis over on his beam
ends.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;On being righted, and got once more
on an even keel, Davis yawed and rolled not
a little. Still the Deaf’un stood off, waiting
for his opponent to make sail for close quarters,
which he did, and again they were
yardarm and yardarm. It was not for long;
away fell Davis, reeling under the weight
of the Deaf’un’s shot, and went over among
the bottles in his own corner.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;It was surprising to see how readily
Davis recovered from what appeared almost
finishing hits. There was much advice-giving
in Davis’s corner, and “Time” was
more than once called before the Welshman
was out of the hands of his seconds. The
round was very short. Davis once again
went in, and this time got on a stinger on
the Deaf’un’s left ear, and a round one in
the bread-basket. A scramble, and both
down.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Davis on the totter, but he steadied
himself and got home his right on Burke’s
body; good counter-hits. Davis got Burke
on the ropes, but he extricated himself, and
closing threw Davis.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Davis hit short and stepped back.
The Deaf’un did not follow. Some little
time spent in sparring; both blown. At
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pageno">113</span>
last the men got together, and Davis, finding
he must do some hard fighting, went in
hand over hand. Burke was with him and
got him down in the hitting under the ropes.
Burke walked to his corner while the Lively
Kid performed a fancy step, leaving Reuben
to make a knee. (Cries of “Take him
away!” from the Londoners.)</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Davis came up all abroad. His knees
seemed to shake under him. Still he steadied
himself as well as he could, and hit out.
Burke merely stepped in and hit him down
with one, two.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;It was all over with Davis. He
walked up to the scratch with an unsteady
step, and stood there quite bewildered. The
Deaf’un faced him. Some one in Davis’s
corner cried “Don’t hit him!” The
Deaf’un stepped over the scratch and caught
hold of his right hand, Davis’s seconds
rushed forward, received him in their arms,
and conveyed him to his corner. Time,
<em>twenty-seven minutes</em>.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Burke is all to nothing the
better fighter at points. The battle was
never in doubt after the first few rounds.
Experience, coolness, and readiness, and a
good deal of work without much show,
marked the Deaf’un’s tactics throughout.
More than once he played off his favourite
manœuvre with effect. This consists in
throwing himself in a loose and careless
attitude, and looking at his man’s feet, or
anywhere but in his face, when, if his adversary
takes the bait and comes in, he suddenly
lets fly, and seldom fails to administer
a couple of punishing blows, or at least a
damaging counter-hit. David Davis, who,
we learn, has a long time worked in London
as a coachspring maker, and who beat
Manning in the short space of 24 minutes on
Wolverhampton race-course in December,
1828, has now been beaten by the Deaf’un
in 27 minutes. The Brums were deceived by
the reports of Bill Cosens, who never ceased
disparaging the merits of the Deaf’un, whom
he boasts of having “beaten easily,” though
he has several times shuffled out of a second
engagement with him. Davis returned to
Birmingham on Wednesday week, after
showing at the Deaf’un’s benefit, and the
giving up of the stakes at Reuben Marten’s,
on the following Tuesday. Davis’s chief
visible hurts were these&mdash;&#8203;injured left hand
and discolouration of the eyes.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>One Blissett, a 14-stone man, and a butcher by trade, having crept into
favour with himself and his fraternity by some bye-battles, and defeating
Brown (the Northampton Baker), was matched against the Deaf’un, not a
few of the “kill-bull” brotherhood hoping to reverse the verdict in the
case of Hands, who was still a popular favourite among them. In this
affair the Deaf’un again posted the first “fiver,” this time out of his stake
with Davis, whereon Tom Cannon, on the part of Mr. Hayne, promised
the rest of the stake of £25, and the day of battle was fixed for the 26th
of May. The betting began at 6 to 4 on the Deaf’un. Burke went into
training at the “Crown,” at Holloway, and Blissett took his breathings at
the “Black Horse,” Greenford Green. There was a good muster of the
sporting public on the ground at Colney Heath, Blissett coming on the
ground in style with a four-in-hand, sporting a crimson flag and black
border, the Deaf’un a green-and-orange handkerchief. When stripped,
Burke appeared in a fancy pair of white drawers of a glazed material,
trimmed and bound with green ribbons, and tied with green bows at the
knees, where they were joined by a pair of blue-and-white striped stockings.
Blissett weighed 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 12<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, and stood 6<abbr title="foot">ft</abbr>; the Deaf’un 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, and
stood 5<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> 8<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr>
</p>
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pageno">114</span>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>We shall give but a general sketch of the
rounds of this one-sided affair. In the first
round Blissett, who displayed more sparring
ability than was expected, began by
planting heavily on the Deaf’un’s eyebrow,
which he cut, and thus gained the first
event amidst the uproarious cheers of his
admirers. Soon after, however, the scene
was changed, for the Deaf’un, getting under
his guard, gave him several such severe body
blows, that the big one, who certainly carried
too much flesh, literally staggered and
caught the top rope with his hand, while
the Deaf’un had his opponent’s head at his
mercy, until, recovering himself, Blissett
forced a wild rally, in which he bored the
Deaf’un down, without doing much mischief.
In the following rounds Blissett, who was
already piping, tried to lead off, but generally
either missed or was stopped, while the
Deaf’un, every now and then, got in a
rattling hit on the mouth, eyes, or nose, in
pretty equal succession. Before the 10th
round was reached, Burke had not only got
his man down to his own weight, but forced
the fighting, or the reverse, at his own will,
getting slyly inside and under Blissett’s
hands, and hitting up at half-arm with
punishing effect. After two or three more
rounds of furious and wild fighting on the
part of Blissett, he fell off, and in the 13th
round the Deaf’un closed, lifted him, and
threw him heavily. In the 14th and 15th
rounds Blissett, after receiving a prop or
two, literally got down amidst some hissing.
Despite Young Dutch Sam’s urging him on,
the big one now fought shy; indeed he was
frightfully punished about the head.</p>

<p>     In the 17th and 18th rounds Blissett, after
a hit or two, turned away and fell on his
knees and hands; and when he fell in the
19th and last round from a coming blow,
Sam threw up the sponge, and the Deaf’un
was hailed the victor amidst loud cheering.
Time, 44 minutes.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Blissett was conveyed back to town, and the Deaf’un, having dressed,
assisted to beat out the ring for the next fight, in which Young Richmond
(a smart bit of ebony only 18 years of age, son of the renowned old Bill),
was defeated by the afterwards celebrated Jack Adams, a <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span> of Jem
Burn.</p>

<p>Burke now laid by for a time, part of the interval from a boating accident,
in which he badly injured the cap of his knees, which detained him in
a hospital for several weeks. That this was serious we may conclude from the
fact, that the writer was more than once told by the Deaf’un, in after years,
that, “Though you can’t see nothing, misters, I often feels my leg go all
of a suddent.” There was, in fact, a partial anchylosis, or stiffening of the
joint.</p>

<p>In May, 1832, at a dinner at Tom Cribb’s, in Panton Street, Spring, the
ex-champion, Josh Hudson, Ned Neale, Jem Burn (his old antagonist,
Ned Baldwin, had just dropped the reins and quitted his box at the “Coach
and Horses,” <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s Lane), and other leading pugilists were present.
The after-dinner conversation, of course, ran on the past exploits and future
prospects of the Ring. The remarkable group of pugilists&mdash;&#8203;which included
Jem Ward, Peter Crawley, Jem Burn, Ned Baldwin (White-headed Bob),
Shelton, Tom Cannon, Ned Neale, Young Dutch Sam, Alec Reid, and
Bishop Sharpe, the successors of Tom Spring, Langan, Bill Neale, Ned
Painter, Josh Hudson, Oliver, and Hickman&mdash;&#8203;had, before 1832, each
fought his last fight, and “the slate” was positively clear of any engagements
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pageno">115</span>
among the “heavies.” Among the guests was a cavalry officer, whose
regiment being ordered for India (“short service” and “home leave on
urgent private affairs” were not then in fashion), expressed his regret to
jolly Josh Hudson, that he believed the race of “big ’uns” was extinct,
and that he should “never see the like again” of those present. Josh, of
course, coincided, but when the soldier added, that he would gladly give
“a note with a strawberry-tart corner” to see such a mill, old Jack Carter,
who had come in with the dessert, “put in his spoke,” and asked Josh
whether he couldn’t “find him a job,” as he was ready and willing, and felt
himself man enough for any second-rater who would make a good fight for
a little money. Jack added that he had only the day before seen Burke
rowing at Woolwich, being well of his bad knee, and complaining of the
“deadness” of everything, and that they had come up to town together.</p>

<p>“Where there’s a will there’s a way.” The soldier had no time to spare, and
was prompt; the men promised to be at the “Old Barge House,” Woolwich,
on the morning of the 8th of May, meeting on the previous day at Josh’s
“Half-Moon” tap, to make final arrangements. Tom Oliver, who was
present, was officially engaged, also Jack Clarke; Dick Curtis and Frank
Redmond volunteered to pick up the Deaf’un, and all was smoothly settled.</p>

<p>There was a select muster, with an unusual sprinkling of swells, on that
pleasant morning of the merry month of May in the Woolwich Marshes,
near the “Old Barge House,” round the newly painted stakes and a new set
of ropes, <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> recently presented to Tom Oliver by the F.P.C. (Fair Play
Club), through the hands of Tom Belcher. The men were punctual. Carter
was waited on by Barney Aaron and Sol. Reubens (who had lately fought
Tom Smith, the East End Sailor Boy). Old Jack certainly looked “hard,”
and also, as Barney added, “brown and stale, like a well-kept loaf.” He,
however, stripped “big,” and showed the outlines of the once boasted
“Lancashire hero,” the opponent of Spring, Richmond, Cribb (in a
turn-up), Shelton, and Jem Ward. He was neatly got up, but showing
unmistakable marks of age, as well he might, for Jack was now entering
his 43rd summer, having been born in September, 1789. The Deaf’un,
too, was in good trim, deducting the ugly defect of a stiff knee&mdash;&#8203;a serious
drawback when opposed to length, weight, and height. Of these, however,
the cheerful Deaf’un made no account, and was as lively and quaint as a
Merry Andrew, in his grotesque green and yellow kickseys, and striped
coverings of his sturdy pedestals.</p>

<p>The fight, though displaying courage, offered little in the way of science.
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pageno">116</span>
For the first four rounds Carter bored in and drove the Deaf’un against
the ropes, where he tried in vain to hold him for a “hug,” the Deaf’un
hitting up sharply to the damage of Carter’s figure-head, and then getting
through his hands with little damage. The Deaf’un was certainly out of
order somewhere in the victualling department, for towards the middle of
the short fight he retched and was violently sick from his exertions in a
throw. This revived the hopes of the Carter party, against whom the game
was evidently going. It was, however, but a passing gleam; the Deaf’un
shook off his qualms of indigestion, rattled in without standing for any
repairs, old Jack became stiff as a wooden image, then groggy as a sailor
three sheets in the wind, and finally, at the end of the 11th round, went
down “all of a heap,” and declared he “could fight no more,” at which
conclusion it took him only 25 minutes to arrive.</p>

<p>The ring cleared, Josh announced to his patron that he had, foreseeing
that the big ’uns might, one or the other, “come short,” provided an
after-piece, by then and there getting off a “little go;” said “little go”
being the match between Izzy Lazarus<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_15" id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span>
and Jem Brown (the go-cart
man). This was indeed a rattling and active fight, until, after
an hour’s sharp milling, in which capital “points” were made by
both men, the Thames police landed from their galleys and compelled a
move, at the same time informing them that “it was no use crossing the
river, as they should follow them up or down, either to the
City-stone at Staines, or to Yantlet Creek.” In this hopeless state
of affairs it was proposed to divide the original £10 stakes and the
added purse, which was assented to by the Napoleon, of Go-cart
men, and his Israelitish opponent, who had had, no doubt, quite enough of
each other “at the prishe.” The “swell” division bowled back to the
great metrop., well pleased with their day’s outing, though the drop fell
rather suddenly on the second pugilistic performance.</p>

<p>The Deaf’un for some months confined himself to the business of an
exhibitor and teacher of the art, superintending the sparring rooms at the
“Coach and Horses,” and demonstrating at Reuben Marten’s on certain
nights in the week. He might also always be depended on (which many
men not so good as he were not) to lend a hand in aid of any poor pug
in distress or difficulty.</p>

<p>Towards the close of 1832 the Deaf’un formed part of a professional party
(organised by his late opponent Jack Carter), who visited Manchester,
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pageno">117</span>
Liverpool, Bradford, and other towns, to enlighten the Lancashire and
Yorkshire tykes upon the true principles and manly practices of the art of
self-defence, as taught in the best schools of boxing. These milling
missionaries&mdash;&#8203;we have seen less laudable missions since that day&mdash;&#8203;of course
awakened more or less a “revival” of “fair play,” the study of the gloves,
and the legitimate use of the fist among both the “upper” and “lower”
orders. While at Hull an immense specimen of a gigantic North countryman,
of the name of Macone, having had “a try with the gloves,” thought
“he could lick any of these Lunnoners except Jock (Carter) and he was
too old to talk aboot.” The Deaf’un thought quite differently; so £20 a
side was put down, and, with only a few days’ training, Macone and the
Deaf’un faced each other at Lackington Bottom, near Beverley, on the
8th January, 1833. “Macone,” says the meagre report of the battle,
“stood 6 feet 2 inches, and weighed 15 stone, and had polished off several
big yokels in first-rate style. The Yorkshireman was in first-rate condition,
while the Deaf’un was generally thought not quite up to the mark. He
weighed 13 stone (a little too heavy) and stood 5 foot 8.” Of the battle
we have scanty particulars, yet the reporter adds, “it was such a fight as
would not have disgraced the days of Cribb and Belcher. Burke had to
do all he knew to obtain a victory over his large opponent, who turned
out the bravest of the brave, and took his gruel without a murmur, until he
could no more stand up to receive.”</p>

<p>We have here, for the sake of keeping the chronological order of the
Deaf’un’s fights, followed on with his “crowning triumph” over the
mighty but unskilful Macone, and shall here “hark back” a few months,
just to show how ready Jem Burke was to “negotiate” with any boxer
who might be “getting mouldy for want of a bating.” His old adversary
Cosens appears to have thought that the Deaf’un’s accident had laid him
“on the shelf,” for he kept from time to time firing off challenges, in Pierce
Egan’s and other sporting papers. Here is one of them, which certainly
savours of “gag,” especially as the writer was then upon a sparring tour,
and in the same paper advertises a “benefit” at Brighton:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">

<p>“<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;&#8203;I wish to inform Deaf Burke, as he takes upon himself the ‘Championship of
England,’ that I am ready to fight him again. Should he think proper to do so, I will meet

a side, to come off within one or two months, as he may prefer.</p>

<p>This affair of Hudson’s was a mere “flash-in-the-pan.” Josh’s day was
decidedly gone by, while the Deaf’un, whose birth dated but five years
previous to Josh’s first ring-fight, was in the prime of youthful strength
and vigour.</p>

<p>Another of Burke’s challengers at this time, a Welshman of the name of
Bill Charles, “loomed large” in the Principality and the West of England.
He had twice beaten Jem Bailey, of Bristol, and polished off several
rural commoners, and recently (June 4, 1832) conquered a local favourite,
Tom Trainer (much under his own weight). From this triumph the
<span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi disant</span> champion’s bounce became so intolerable that Trainer’s friends
clubbed their resources, and resolved to back the Deaf’un, as a fit and proper
man, a very <i>Orlando</i>, to floor this braggart <i>Charles</i>; but unfortunately
this portion of <cite>As You Like It</cite> was not rehearsed in Taffy-land, the “Lunnon
cove” not being to the liking of Charles’s friends. Burke went down to
Newport (Monmouthshire) to make the match; but the Welshman’s
backers (like Aminadab’s servant when he opened the door, on the chain,
to the bailiff) seem to have taken alarm at the formidable appearance of
the Deaf’un, and Mr. Charles replied, on behalf of his patron, “Master
hath seen thee and he doth not like thee;” preferring to forfeit a small
deposit. Burke offered to fight “the Welsh Champion” half-way between
Abergavenny and Newport, or near Bristol, or at Monmouth Gap, for £50
or £100 a side, but the affair went off, and Burke returned to London&mdash;&#8203;matchless.</p>

<p>On the retirement of Ward from the Championship, among the crowd
of pretenders to the title, the Deaf’un certainly had the fairest claim,
having fought his way up, refusing no opponent, and disposing of every
competitor, save one, and he afterwards declined to risk a repetition of the
contest, upon transparent quibbles.</p>

<p>At a meeting at Tom Spring’s, in a pugilistic palaver, wherein matches
were discussed, examined, and the <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em> agreed and decided on, the
Deaf’un, in his peculiar style, suggested, that he would like a match with
Young Dutch Sam, “becos he was so clevers,” or Simon Byrne, “becos he was
big enoughs,” or, in fact, with anybody that “tought himselfs champions.”
At first Young Sam seemed disposed to take up the glove, but on reflection
he said, “Burke was too heavy for him by more than a stone and a half.
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pageno">119</span>
That was giving too much away.” Shortly afterwards a well-known Irish
Colonel coming in, declared his readiness to back Byrne against the challenger,
and a meeting was appointed for the following Tuesday at Spring’s.
On the day named Simon’s “needful” was tabled; but alas! the poor
Deaf’un was obliged to acknowledge his failure in enlisting any kind friend
to back him, as “they were all out of towns when he called on ’em. But,”
continued he, “to shows as I means fightins there’s a soverins of my owns
to begins with&mdash;&#8203;let Byrne’s friends cover thats, and on Thursday week I
hopes I’ll make it tens, an if not&mdash;&#8203;why, I’m de fools.” Two gentlemen present,
admiring Burke’s pluck, added a sovereign each, making three, which
were covered by Spring for Byrne. <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, speaking of this meeting,
says: “It is to be hoped that Burke will not lack supporters; he may not
possess the gift of the gab, but he wants none of the requisites of a British
boxer; he is honest, brave, and confident; and from his past good
character, as well as the prompt humanity he lately showed in rescuing
fellow-creatures from danger at the risk of his own life (we allude to his
saving two children, who were buried in the ruins of some houses in Essex
Street, Strand), it would be discreditable to see such a man lost for a trifle.
It is always in the power of many to assist one, and here is an opportunity
for those who wish to patronise the old British game of boxing upon
honest principles which should not be overlooked.” The week after this
appeal Burke found his friends (he did not call upon those who were “out
of town,” he told us), and the match was made for £100 a side, to come off
on the 30th May, 1833.</p>

<p>A singular circumstance occurred to the Deaf’un on his way home from
Spring’s on the night when the occurrences took place which led to this
anecdote of Burke’s good qualities. A fire was raging in Long Acre,
in a poor and populous neighbourhood, at which Burke especially distinguished
himself, and was honourably mentioned for his courageous
exertions, rescuing a great deal of humble property at no small personal
peril.</p>

<p>As we propose to give but a brief sketch of the ring career of Simon
Byrne, as a pendant to the present memoir, we shall not here break the
thread of our story, but proceed at once to the details of this unfortunate
contest.</p>

<p>“The Irish Champion” was backed on this occasion by “all the talent.”
Jem Ward, Ned Neale, Tom Spring, and Jem Burn were, to use a professional
phrase, “behind him,” and he had at his command all that money
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pageno">120</span>
and skill could do for him. On arriving in town from Liverpool, Simon’s
weight exceeded 15 stone, and this mountain of flesh he had to reduce and
did reduce to 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> With this view he was at once sent off to Ned
Neale’s, at Norwood, and, under his skilful superintendence, by hard work
and sweating, this reduction was effected; but not, we are convinced,
without impairing his natural stamina, for Byrne’s habits in Ireland were,
so said rumour, far from abstemious. Burke, on the contrary&mdash;&#8203;for the
Deaf’un was never a slave to liquor&mdash;&#8203;had only to improve his condition by
good air, sound food, and healthful exercise, of which he took at Northfleet,
under the eye of the veteran Tom Owen, a full share both on and off the
water, much of his time being spent in rowing. Burke on the morning of
fighting weighed 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, the weight which Captain Barclay declared,
when combined with science, to be heavy enough to box Goliath himself.
We ought not to omit that Tom Gaynor generously took Burke under his
wing, and guaranteed his training and personal expenses.</p>

<p>No Man’s Land was fixed upon for the battle, in consequence of an undertaking
on the part of Mr. Coleman, of the Turf Tavern, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s, to
raise £25, to be equally divided between the men. On Wednesday evening,
May 29th, the night before fighting, both men reached <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s in good
spirits, and both confident as to the result. Burke was the favourite in
the betting, as he had been, more or less, since the match was made; the
odds varying between 5 to 4 and guineas to pounds. The arrivals at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Alban’s were not numerous on Wednesday, but on Thursday morning there
was unusual bustle, and as the day advanced the crowd of vehicles was
such as to recall the olden times of the ring. The piece of turf chosen for
the encounter was smooth as a bowling-green; in fact, nothing could have
been more suitable to the purpose, or better calculated to have afforded a
good view of the contest, but for the irregularity which prevailed among
the throng, who, in spite of all entreaty, crowded round the ropes and
stakes during the battle, and, by the most disgraceful confusion, not only
shut out the view of the combatants, but distracted the attention and
excited the fears of the spectators by a succession of fights and squabbles.
The men arrived on the ground soon after 12 o’clock. The Deaf’un was
all jollity, and full of antics, having disfigured his Grimaldi countenance
with white patches, for the amusement of the yokels, at whom he kept
making wry faces all the way from his quarters; in fact, had he been
going to a fair instead of into the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> he could not have been in higher
spirits. Byrne was more staid, but still was cheerful. He was the first to
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pageno">121</span>
enter the ring, attended by Tom Spring and Jem Ward; he was loudly
cheered. Burke soon followed, accompanied by Tom Gaynor and Dick
Curtis, and was received with equal marks of favour. A good deal of time
was lost in settling preliminaries, during which the Deaf’un continued his
playful tricks, much to the astonishment of Byrne, who exclaimed he did
“not think the man was in his right sinses.”</p>

<p>On stripping, it was obvious that Burke, in point of muscularity, was
decidedly superior to Byrne, especially in the arms and shoulders; he was
also in the best condition. Byrne looked well, but there was a softness
about his shoulder-blades which showed he was still too fleshy. He stood
about an inch and a half over Burke, but, nevertheless, did not seem to
have much advantage in the reach; upon the whole, the connoisseurs
gave the preference to the Deaf’un, who was health personified. The men
were conducted to the scratch at about half-past one, and immediately
commenced</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Both threw themselves into
defensive positions; the Deaf’un grinning
most confidently, and slyly looking at his
antagonist. Byrne made one or two feints
to draw his man, but Burke waited steadily for
him. They then changed their ground. Byrne
again made a feint, and after the lapse of some
time, both cautious, Byrne let fly with his
left. Burke countered heavily, and caught
Byrne on the mouth, while he had it himself
on the nose. Burke snuffled, and Byrne
cried “First blood.” “No,” said Burke,
and wiping his finger on his nose, withdrew
it unstained. Another short dodging pause,
when Byrne again let go his left, which
dropped on the old spot; while Burke as
quickly returned on the mouth; and again
did the cry of “first blood” resound from
all quarters; and, on inspection, the crimson
was seen on Byrne’s lips, and on Burke’s
proboscis, at one and the same moment.
First blood was claimed for Burke, but disputed;
and we understand the umpires and
the referee decided it was a tie&mdash;&#8203;giving
neither the advantage. Some good counter
hits with the left followed, and in the close,
after an awkward scramble, both went down,
without any decided advantage. On getting
up both showed claret, Byrne from the nose
and mouth, and Burke from the nose. Burke
also showed the mark of a hit on the right
brow.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Long sparring. Burke waiting for
Byrne to begin, being well on his guard.
Both offered, but did not strike. At last
Byrne popped in his left on Burke’s mouth,
while Burke’s left, in the counter, went over
his shoulder. Burke looked slyly down at
Byrne’s body, as if intending to make his
next hit there, but stealing a march, he
threw in his left on Byrne’s mouth. Byrne
was, however, awake, and countered. Mutual
dodging. Burke stopped Byrne’s left cleverly;
and after more sparring, Burke exclaimed,
“Isn’t this beautiful, Simons?”
while Gaynor said “his man was certain to
win, and should be backed against any man
in England.” Burke tried his right, but
missed, and the men rushed to a rally.
Heavy hitting took place, and in the close
Byrne had the advantage, giving the Deaf’un
the crook, and falling heavily on him, but
on getting up it was obvious the hitting was
on a par, as both had received some ugly
clouts. These two rounds occupied 17
minutes.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Burke stopped Byrne’s left in good
style, and waited for the renewed attack.
Both cautious. Burke again stopped a left-handed
stinger, and succeeded in throwing
in his own left on Byrne’s mouth. This
brought them to a rally, and the hitting left
and right was lively and pretty. In the
close there was some good in-fighting in
favour of Byrne, but in the struggle for the
throw both went down slovenly, Burke
under.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Counter-hits with the left, when
Byrne threw in a tremendous whack with
his right on the back of Burke’s head; had
it been in front the effect might have been
conclusive. Burke, at the same moment,
caught him in the ribs with his right. A
rally followed, in which hits were exchanged;
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">122</span>
and, in the close, Burke was thrown. On
getting up, both showed additional claret
from their smellers, and Byrne had evidently
had a refresher on his left ogle.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;A good rally, commencing with left-handed
counters; both napped it. Byrne
stepped back, and as Burke came he gave
him the upper-cut with his right, and closing
threw him heavily. Loud shouts for
Byrne; and Jem Ward asked the Deaf’un
how he liked that. The Deaf’un laughed,
and shook his head, observing, “Very good,
Misters.”</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;The knuckle of Byrne’s right hand
now began to swell&mdash;&#8203;the consequence of its
terrific contact with the Deaf’un’s canister in
the fourth round. Pretty counter-hits with
the left, ending in a rally, in which both hit
away left and right. In stepping back from
his own blow, Burke fell on his corobungus,
and first knock-down was claimed, but not
allowed, as it was clearly a slip.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Counter-hitting with the left. Burke
again made some pretty stops. The men
fought in a rally to the corner, where Byrne
caught Burke under his arm, and fibbed, but
not effectively, and ultimately threw him,
falling heavily on his <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus</span>. “He can do
nothing but throw,” cried Curtis; and the
Deaf’un was up, and as jolly as ever.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Heavy slaps, right and left; both had
it on the nob. Burke was driven against
the ropes, and Byrne fought well in. Burke
butted,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_16" id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span>
and in the end got down, Byrne on
him.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Both cautious. Byrne again trying
the feint, but Burke well on his guard. At
last Byrne let fly his left, but Burke was
with him, and returned it heavily. In the
close, Byrne tried for the throw, when
Burke hung by his arms round his neck.
At last Byrne hit him a tremendous blow
with his right on the body, and they both
went down together.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Both resined their hands,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_17" id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span>
and set-to
as fresh as daisies. Byrne dropped in a
slight muzzler with his left, which was followed
by counter-hitting, and a severe rally.
Byrne missed a terrific upper-cut, which
would have told a fearful tale, and fell.
Both exhibited considerable marks of punishment
on getting on their seconds’ knees.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Short counter-hitting with the left,
followed by a determined rally, in which
the nobbers left and right were severe. In
the close Byrne down.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Burke threw in a stinging hit with
his right on Byrne’s ribs. A weaving rally
followed, which was concluded by Byrne’s
getting down, amidst the jeers of the Deaf’un’s
friends.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Byrne popped in his left. Burke
tried to counter, but missed. A wild rally,
in which Burke was driven to the corner of
the ring, and fell; Byrne tumbling on him
with his knee, it was said, in a tender place,
whether designedly or not we could not
judge.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Byrne had a suck at the brandy-bottle
before he commenced; when the
Deaf’un rattled in, and gave him a heavy
round hit with the right on the body, and
went down from the force of his own blow.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Counter-hitting with the left. Burke
active on his pins. Byrne missed a right-handed
hit, and fell, we suspect rather from
design than accident.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Burke popped in his left and right,
two stinging hits. Byrne returned with the
left, closed, and threw him.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Burke now had recourse to “drops
of brandy,” and Byrne, who had shown
symptoms of distress, seemed to have got
fresher. Counter-hitting with the left, both
catching it on the chops, and showing more
pink. A short rally. Byrne fought well in;
and in the close, both down, the Deaf’un
under.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;The fight had now lasted 45 minutes.
Long sparring, and both slow in their operations.
Burke, in his usual cunning manner,
looked down as if studying the movements
of Byrne’s feet, and popped in a whack with
the left on his body; a manœuvre which he
tried a second time, with equal success, with
his right on the ribs. Burke stopped a left-handed
hit, but caught another nasty one
from Byrne’s right on the neck; it was a
round hit, and missed the butt of the ear,
for which it was intended. A short rally;
when Byrne tried for the fall, but in swinging
round was himself thrown.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Burke showed feverish symptoms in
his mouth, which was extremely dry. Long
sparring, and pretty stops on both sides.
Burke threw in a heavy smasher with his
left on Byrne’s mouth, and followed it with
tremendous heavy hit with his right on the
ear. Byrne made a rejoinder with his left
on the Deaf’un’s nose, and turned quickly
round on his heel. “How do you like that?”
cried Ward. Both ready, and on their
guard; Burke evidently waiting for Byrne
to commence; but incautiously putting down
his hands to wipe them on his drawers,
Byrne, as quick as lightning, popped in a
snorter. Loud laughter at Burke’s expense.
Burke rushed to a rally, and some severe
hitting right and left followed, Byrne
receiving a cut over his left eye. Byrne
administered the upper-cut, and in the close,
went down.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;One hour and 20 minutes had now
elapsed. Counter-hitting with the left, but
not much execution done. In the close, both
down. Byrne’s right hand seemed to be of
little use to him.</p>

<p>     The same style of fighting was persevered
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pageno">123</span>
in, with little advantage on either side, till
the 27th round, by which time one hour and
47 minutes had elapsed; and the crowd
had so completely closed in round the ropes
as to prevent the distant spectators from
witnessing the progress of the fight.</p>

<p>     In the 27th round, after counter-hits with
the left on both sides, at the head, Burke
popped his left heavily on Byrne’s body.
Byrne rushed to a rally, and Burke, retreating
to the ropes, received a heavy hit in the
head, which dropped him. The first knock-down
was here universally admitted.</p>

<p>     In the 29th round Burke was thrown
heavily, his head coming with tremendous
force on the ground; and in the 30th, Byrne,
catching him against the ropes, gave him
some severe body blows with the right, and
finally threw him. While lying on his face,
Burke was sick, and threw up some blood;
his friends looked blue.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Burke came up weak, and rather
groggy. Byrne rushed in, and hit him
heavily on the ribs, and in the close again
threw him. Byrne now became a decided
favourite, and was evidently the fresher
man.</p>

<p>     In the 35th round, two hours having
elapsed, Byrne again caught Burke at the
ropes, and in the in-fighting, gave him some
severe punishment, while Burke butted.
Burke thrown.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;Byrne pursued the same system of
boring his opponent to the ropes, and peppered
at him while in that position. In
trying for the fall, Byrne held Burke up by
the neck for some time, trying to fib with
his right, but not effectively; but at last
Ward gave him the office, and he let him go,
falling heavily upon him.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;Burke sick, but still resolute. From
this to the 43rd round Byrne seemed to have
it his own way, and Burke was so much
distressed that his friends began to despair
of success. Tom Cannon now jumped into
the ring, followed by several others, and
considerable confusion prevailed. Cannon
had been backing Burke, and evidently came
to urge him to renewed exertion. He loudly
exclaimed, “Get up and fight, Deaf’un; do
you mean to make a cross of it?” A person
who was equally interested on the other side
struck at Cannon, and ultimately got him
outside the ropes. In the interim, Burke
went to work, bored Simon down against the
ropes, but fell outside himself, while Simon
was picked up within the ring.</p>

<p>     In the five following rounds both fought
in a wild and scrambling manner, equally
exhausting to each; and in the 49th round,
Burke, who had summoned all his remaining
strength, rattled away with such fury that
Simon at last went down weak. Here was
another change, and Burke again became
the favourite. From thenceforth to the
99th round, repeated changes took place.
On one occasion the hat was actually thrown
up to announce Byrne’s Victory, from the
impression that Burke was deaf to time, as
he lay, apparently, in a state of stupor; but,
to the surprise of all, Curtis again brought
his man to the scratch, and he renewed the
contest with unshaken courage. From the
state of Byrne’s hands, which were dreadfully
puffed, he was unable to administer a
punishing blow; and round after round the
men were brought up, surrounded by their
partisans, who crowded the arena, and by
sprinkling them with water, fanning them
with their hats, and other expedients, endeavoured
to renew their vigour. To attempt
a description of each round, from the uproar
which prevailed, would be impossible. Burke,
whenever placed before his man, hit away
right and left, at the body and head, and
always seemed to have a good hit at him,
although his left hand was almost invariably
open. In the 91st round Simon gave him a
heavy fall, and fell upon him; and it was
here considered that the Deaf’un’s chances
were almost beyond a hope. Still he continued
to come up at the call of his seconds, and each
round exhibited a determined display of
manly milling; both hit away with resolution,
and the men were alternately uppermost. At
last, in the 93rd round, Byrne exhibited
such symptoms of exhaustion that the shouts
of the friends of Burke cheered him to fresh
exertion, and, rushing in wildly, he hit
Byrne down, and fell over him. This made
such a decided change for the worse in
Simon, and for the six following rounds he
came up so groggy, that he was scarcely
able to stand, and rolled before the Deaf’un
like a ship in a storm. Bad as he was, he
continued to meet the Deaf’un with his
left, and to do all that nature would permit.
Burke, however, proved himself to have the
better constitution, and continued to pepper
away till the last round, when Byrne fell
senseless, and was incapable of being again
lifted on his legs. Burke, who was also in
the last stage of exhaustion, was immediately
hailed as the conqueror, amidst the reiterated
cheers of his friends. The fight
lasted exactly 3 hours and 16 minutes and
at its conclusion, Gaynor proclaimed that
Burke was “Champion of England.” Ward,
who was in the ring attending to Byrne,
exclaimed “Walker,” but whether he means
to dispute Burke’s claim to that distinction
remains to be seen. Byrne was carried to
his vehicle, while Burke, with difficulty,
was able to walk from the ring. The scene
that prevailed in the ring for the last hour
was disgraceful, and shut out from the spectators
a view of the most part of the fight.
It would be difficult to say which side was
most to blame, for in fact each man had his
party, who were equally busy in their interference.
It is but justice, however, to say
that the men themselves received fair play,
and that there was nothing done towards
them which called for censure.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Upon the character of this
protracted fight we have few observations
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pageno">124</span>
to make. The length of time which two
men of such size continued to attack each
other, and to pour in a succession of blows,
without any decided effect, proves that, as
compared with the olden members of the
ring, they did not possess those punishing
qualities which are essential to an accomplished
boxer; and that they have earned
little of that admiration which, in former
times, was excited by the slashing execution
of big men. Burke evidently possessed more
cunning than Byrne, and often took him by
surprise by threatening the body when he
meant the head, and <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</span>. The early
injury to Byrne’s right hand was a decided
disadvantage, and had he fought more at
the body, from Burke’s sickness, it was considered
the result might have been different.
Taking the battle as a whole, however, it
certainly entitled the men to the greatest
praise, and placed them on record as boxers
of the highest courage and extraordinary
powers of receiving. But for the disorder
which prevailed, we have no doubt the contest
would have elicited universal astonishment,
especially towards the finish, when
the adversaries rushed to each other repeatedly,
and hit away with unshrinking courage
and perseverance, never going down without
a mutual dose of pepper. As the battle drew
toward a close, Byrne missed many of his
left-handed counters, and in the 98th round
received such a stinging hit with the right
on his temple, that on coming up for the
last time, it was clear his chances were gone
by. The Deaf’un rushed in to finish, and,
being still “himself,” had only to hit out
and end his extraordinary labours.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>The men, after the fight, were re-conducted to their respective
quarters at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s, and were both put to bed. Byrne was bled
by a surgeon, but continued in a state of stupor. His punishment
seemed to have been severest on the left side of the head; his left
eye was completely closed, while his mouth and face generally
were much swollen. In the body, too, there had been many blows,
especially on his left side. He received every possible attention, and a
gentleman who had been extremely kind to him in his training remained
with him the whole night. Burke was by no means so great a sufferer,
although he bore severe marks of hitting, and his arms, from the shoulders
to the wrists, were black with stopping. To his heavy falls his sickness
was principally attributed. As a proof that he was “all right,” as he said,
after lying in bed a few hours, he got up and dressed, and went to town
the same night, and showed at Tom Gaynor’s, where he received the congratulations
of his friends, and talked of throwing down the gauntlet to
all England as soon as he recovered.</p>

<p>In the same paper we find that poor Byrne’s state had become very precarious
on the day after the fight; that his head had been shaved, and
leeches applied to the bruised parts. It was thought by his friends that
his mind was deeply affected by his defeat, and that he suffered as much
from this feeling as from bodily injuries. On the Saturday night intelligence
was received in town that the poor fellow was much better, and it
was hoped out of danger, but these hopes, unfortunately, were not destined
to be realised, for we find in the next number of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, the following
remarks:&mdash;&#8203;“Poor Simon, on the Saturday after the mill, became
so much better that he was apparently quite himself, and expressed his
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pageno">125</span>
thanks for the attentions he had received. He said, ‘if he died, of which
he had a presentiment, his death would be more attributable to the irregularity
of his mode of life before he went into training, than to any injury
sustained in the fight.’ His mind, however, was evidently deeply affected
by his defeat, and he frequently declared he would rather have died than
been beaten; and, indeed, such was his increasing nervous agitation, that
in the course of the evening he again relapsed into insensibility, from
which he did not afterwards recover. On Sunday morning an express was
sent off to London for Spring, who had been called to town on business.
He immediately obeyed the summons, and on arriving at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s, and
finding the precarious state in which Byrne was, at once sent for Sir Astley
Cooper, who humanely proceeded without delay to the house where
Byrne lay, and entered into consultation with the gentleman who was in
attendance. Sir Astley at once saw that the case was hopeless. He, however,
administered such remedies as he thought best, and remained with
the poor fellow until his death, which took place at half-past eight in the
evening. It was believed by both medical men that the symptoms of the
unfortunate man were aggravated by his depressed state of mind at his
defeat. There was also a strong belief that the reflection of his having
been instrumental to the death of Sandy M’Kay also preyed upon his
spirits, as he expressed a presentiment of his own death. From the first
moment of his entering the ring, it was observable that his countenance
wore an aspect of deep care and thought, and when Burke was distressed,
he regarded him with evident feelings of commiseration. While he fought
with manly courage, and never shrank from danger, it was clear he was
not following the suggestions of his nature. He was not, in fact, a quarrelsome
man, but on the contrary, seemed animated by the most kindly disposition,
and was alike mild in his manner and his language. Burke, also,
although a rough, unpolished man, evidently had no feeling of animosity
towards his unfortunate antagonist; the only object he had in view was to
obtain victory. In fact, no two men ever entered the ring whose sentiments
towards each other were so thoroughly devoid of malice, and whose
object was so entirely wrapped up in the desire of fame; the one being
influenced by a wish to wipe out the prejudices excited most unjustly from
a former defeat, and the latter by anxiety to excel in a profession which
from his boyhood was the darling object of his ambition. With all his
roughness, however, Burke has given traits of an excellent disposition he
has on more than one occasion risked his own life to save the lives of
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pageno">126</span>
others. He is also strictly honest and sober, and altogether his character
stands so high that this alone has led to his obtaining backers.”</p>

<p>The inquest was held on Byrne on the Monday after the fight, before
Mr. Blagg. Some of the witnesses deposed that the men were often carried
to the scratch; and that towards the conclusion of the battle they did
not think they could have gone up alone.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_18" id="fnanchor_18"></a><a href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Mr. Kingston, a surgeon of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s, who attended the deceased,
stated that he bled him, and applied leeches to his head; that there was
concussion of the brain, but that the deceased was occasionally sensible.
Witness attended him constantly until his death. On a <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</span> examination
he found a great deal of extravasated blood about the left side of the
head. The brain and dura mater were also distended with blood. The
heart, liver, and intestines were perfectly healthy. Deceased was a
fine, muscular man, and witness attributed his death to the congested
state of the brain, combined with prolonged and violent exertions, and
the mental suffering under defeat.</p>

<p>The Coroner: “Then deceased came by his death from the blows?”&mdash;&#8203;Witness:
“In my opinion, had the deceased been the victor instead of the
beaten party there would have been a chance of his recovery. There was
not sufficient injury on the head to account for death.” The Coroner
attempted to find out the names of the time-keeper and referee, but without
avail, and at length summed up, and the jury returned a verdict of
“Manslaughter against Deaf Burke as principal in the first degree, and
Tom Spring, Jem Ward, Dick Curtis, and Tom Gaynor, and the umpires
and referee as principals in the second degree.” The coroner then
made out his warrant for the committal of the parties against whom the
verdict was returned.</p>

<p>The body of poor Simon was buried at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s, on the Tuesday
after the inquest. He was 32 years of age. An appeal was made by the
Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite> for the poor fellow’s widow, which was
headed by himself with five guineas, and to this, the same week, the
Deaf’un, Spring, Ward, Gaynor, and Curtis each added a similar sum, and
in a very short time the sum of £262 was raised for the unfortunate woman.
</p>
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pageno">127</span>

<p><span class="sc">The Trial.</span>&mdash;&#8203;On Thursday, July 11th, 1833, the trial of Spring, Ward,
Gaynor, Curtis, and the Deaf’un took place at Hertford Assizes. On the
previous day, when Mr. Justice Bailey charged the Grand Jury, he alluded
to the case in a humane and impartial manner, and the Grand Jury found
a true bill against all the parties concerned. On the Thursday morning, Burke
and Dick Curtis, who had surrendered, were put to the bar before Mr.
Justice Park, and pleaded not guilty. As Spring and the other two
accused did not surrender at first, the trial of these men was proceeded
with. Witnesses were first called who proved that the fight had taken
place, after which Mr. Kingston, the surgeon who had attended Byrne up
to the time of his death, was examined. He described the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</span>
examination, and the appearance of the body, in similar terms to those
which he had used before the Coroner. He next said the fulness of the
vessels of the brain might be caused in various ways, by blows, or falls, or
excitement. After three hours’ fighting such an appearance might be
produced; the exertion might have caused it without a blow. He did not
find the vessels of the brain more distended where the bruises were than
in the other parts; the cause of death was the congested state of the brain.</p>

<p>Examined by Mr. Justice Park: “Then, finding the vessels in the same
congested state all over the head, as you have described, should you
attribute that appearance more to general exertion than to blows or
external violence?”&mdash;&#8203;Witness: “The exertion the deceased underwent
would have been sufficient of itself to have caused this appearance. I
cannot say that the blows he received were the cause of death, either in
the whole or in part. That was the conclusion to which I came on the
<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</span> examination.”</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Park, after hearing this statement, addressed the jury, and
said, “Gentlemen, that makes an end of the case. The indictment charges
that death was occasioned by blows and violence, whereas it appears the
deceased died from other causes. The prisoners, therefore, must be
acquitted.” The jury immediately returned a verdict of “Not guilty,” and
Burke and Curtis were discharged from custody. Messengers were then
despatched to inform Spring, Ward, and Gaynor of the result, and they
then surrendered and were placed at the bar. No evidence, however, was
offered against them, and a verdict of “Not guilty” relieved them from
their anxiety.</p>

<p>On the Thursday following the trial, a congratulatory dinner took place
at Tom Spring’s, at which a subscription was commenced towards defraying
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pageno">128</span>
the expenses of the defence. At the suggestion of a gentleman who presided,
a subscription was also opened, which, in a short period, amounted
to the sum of 100 guineas, for the purpose of presenting a service of plate
to the Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>, as a token of the respect in which
he was held, not only by the men who had recently undergone their trial,
and whose defence he had conducted, but also for the manner in which he
invariably advocated the cause of fair play, and had always been foremost
in the cause of the distressed, the fatherless, and the widow. The service
of plate was presented to Mr. Dowling at a subsequent meeting at Tom
Spring’s.</p>

<p>Soon after the termination of the proceedings against Burke, a challenge
appeared in the Dublin and London papers from O’Rourke, “Champion of
Ireland,” for a meeting on the Curragh of Kildare; but Burke’s friends
properly objected at such a juncture to his fighting in Ireland, the match
therefore dropped.</p>

<p>In July a renewed proposal from Young Dutch Sam to fight the Deaf’un
for £500 a side was made over a sporting dinner at Spring’s, and £5
there and then posted; the battle to come off within a twelvemonth.
This ended in talk and a forfeit, as the Deaf’un could not raise such a
sum.</p>

<p>In the month of September, 1833, the air was filled with challenges,
which fell “thick as the autumn leaves in Vallombrosa;” among them
one from some “gentlemen,” who were ready to back an “Unknown,
to be named at the last deposit, against any man in the world,” for £500
to £1,000 a side. Whereupon Jem Ward accepting the proposal for £500,
and declaring his readiness to make the match, the challengers were silent,
and the “Unknown” remained thenceforth unseen and unheard of.</p>

<p>In September, 1833, a paragraph appeared in London and provincial
papers, to the effect that Deaf Burke would persist in his claim to the
Championship, whereon Ward wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">“<i>To the Editor of</i> ‘<span class="sc">Bell’s Life in London</span>.’</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;&#8203;Should the patron of the ’unknown’ candidate for ‘the Championship’ agree
to allow his man to fight for £500 a side, my friends are ready to back me for that sum.
Failing a match being made with him, I am ready to give any other customer a chance, and
for his accommodation will fight for any sum, from £300 to £500 a side. I am, Sir, your
most obedient servant,</p>

<p class="flushright">“JAMES WARD. Champion of England.</p>

<p class="pneg">“Liverpool, Sept. 18, 1833.”</p>
</div><!--end letter-->

<p>The Editor having submitted this epistle to “the Deaf’un,” observes,
“that individual desires us to say, that ‘he’s ready to stands nps for the
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pageno">129</span>
title for a hundreds, but as for tousands, and that sorts o’ rediklus tings,
he can’t say nuttins about ’em.’” Another challenge elicited the subjoined
from Ward:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">“<i>To the Editor of</i> ‘<span class="sc">Bell’s Life in London</span>.’</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;&#8203;I have long contemplated leaving the Ring altogether, and would not offer myself
again to your notice, had you not inserted a challenge for the Championship, accompanied
by a tempting stake; to which challenge I gave a suitable reply, stating at the time my
readiness to fight the Unknown for £500, or a smaller sum&mdash;&#8203;say £300 or £400 a side. I am
not only willing to fight for the above sums, but to allow the Unknown three months to
deliberate upon it.</p>

<p>“I perceive that Deaf Burke calls himself ‘Champion of England,’ and offers to make a
match with me for £100 a side. Considering that I am in business, such a sum is not worth
contending for, especially as a considerable portion of it must be expended in training and
other incidental expenses. If Deaf Burke means fighting me, I will accommodate him for
£200 a side, and no less. Should this not meet his views in a reasonable time, my intentions
are to retire from the Ring <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">in toto</span>; to that the Unknown and Deaf Burke will know
what to do.</p>

<p class="flushright">“JAMES WARD, Champion of England.</p>
<p class="pneg">“Liverpool, October 2, 1833.”</p>
</div><!--end letter-->

<p>The Deaf’un seemed now doomed to the sickness of “hope deferred.”
He was too good for any of the 12-stone men except the Champion, whose
price, even lowered to £200, was still too high for him. Numerous letters
passed and repassed between O’Rourke and Burke; and on one occasion
O’Rourke dragging in the name of Ward, Jem offered to stake £300 to
O’Rourke’s £200 and fight him in Ireland. To this O’Rourke made no
response, and soon after sailed for America. Ward then offered to meet
Burke £300 to £200; but even at these odds the Deaf’un could not find
backers, at which we need not be surprised when the comparative merits
of the men were weighed in the balance.</p>

<p>Burke, who had certainly, in addition to his great powers as a boxer, a
fund of native and quaint comicality, now utilised his talent as a public
exhibitor of models of statues from the antique, for which his athletic
development well fitted him, alternating them with displays of the Art of
Self-defence. In these tours, wherein his attendant or agent in advance
was the well-known Tommy Roundhead, the trainer (whom the Deaf’un
dubbed his “Secretary”), Burke visited Wales, Bristol, and the West, and
subsequently the Midlands and the North. An incidental notice in a newspaper
published in “the Potteries” gives us a peep at the Deaf’un on his
travels.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">A Voice from the Pitcher Country. Disappointment of the
Pottery Fancy.</span>&mdash;&#8203;On Saturday last Tommy Roundhead, the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avant courier</span>
of Deaf Burke, arrived in Hanley, and cast anchor at Mr. Hawes’s, Angel
Inn, in the Market Place. On making his business known, the worthy
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pageno">130</span>
host offered him the use of the large room in which Tom Spring and Big
Brown exhibited previous to Brown’s fight with Phil Sampson, at Bishop’s
Wood. Roundhead immediately got his handbills printed, and the walls
covered with well-displayed posters, announcing that on Monday and
Tuesday evenings, ‘Deaf Burke, Champion of England, and Harry Preston,
Champion of Birmingham, would take a benefit and exhibit the manly
art of self-defence; the whole to conclude with a grand set-to, previous
to Preston’s return to Birmingham to fight Davis for one hundred
guineas.’</p>

<p>“Tommy gave out that Burke and Preston would arrive at Hanley at
noon on Monday. During the day, but especially in the evening, the
‘Angel’ was crowded. Several indications of impatience were exhibited
at the non-appearance of the men; but in the evening, when the last coach
arrived from Birmingham, and there was no tidings of the ‘Deaf’un,’ an
universal burst of disgust went through the rooms. They all turned upon
Roundhead. Tommy got on his pins, and attempted to explain that he
left Burke on the Thursday at Atherstone, and that he had come to
Hanley, by Burke’s express desire, to engage a room for him and Preston to
spar in. He had written to Burke, at Arthur Matthewson’s, and could only
account for their non-appearance on the score that his letter had not
reached them. The grumblers vehemently vociferated, ‘Stow your patter,
it’s a hoax&mdash;&#8203;it’s no go, Tommy.’ A regular ‘flare-up’ had very near taken
place, but, by good words and persuasion, silence was restored, and the
company dispersed peaceably.”</p>

<p>From what follows, it will be seen that that very shifty gentleman&mdash;&#8203;Harry
Preston&mdash;&#8203;was the real cause of the apparent breach of promise.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The cause of this disappointment is explained by a letter we have
received from Birmingham; from which it appears that Preston and the
Deaf’un had a fall out at Arthur Matthewson’s, which, after lots of chaff
and a deposit of a sovereign a side, was to be decided by a fight the next
morning, but on the Deaf’un going to the scratch Preston ‘would not
have it.’ Some further chatter followed, in which Preston offered to fight
Burke if he would reduce himself to 12 stone. This the Deaf’un declined, but
offered to fight him £120 to £100, or £60 to £50. This would not suit
Harry’s book, and thus the matter ended. The Deaf’un’s next trip is to
Liverpool, and from thence to Scotland, where he is to join Bob Avery
in Glasgow. Poor Tommy Roundhead has been undeservedly censured in
this matter.”
</p>
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pageno">131</span>

<p>That the Deaf’un had considerable pantomimic powers may be gathered
from the fact that he was engaged by the experienced manager of the
Manchester Theatre, to play <i>Orson</i> in the Christmas piece of “Valentine and
Orson” at the Sheffield Theatre.</p>

<p>Thus wore away the year 1834. At Tom Spring’s Anniversary
Dinner, January 14th, 1835, which was numerously attended, Burke
announced that he was about to take a farewell benefit on the ensuing
Wednesday evening, at the “Coach and Horses,” <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s Lane,
previous to his starting for America, to fight the Irish Champion, O’Rourke,
or any other man in the United States or Canada who might fancy him.
He had come to this determination, he said, because, although ready and willing
to fight Ward for £200, Ward, after proposing to fight for that sum,
raised his price to £300, and then, finding even that large stake was likely
to be obtained, valued himself at the still higher sum of £500, which was
utterly beyond the reach of his (Burke’s) friends. For his own part, all
he wanted was the glory of the title for which he was the candidate, and,
to show that he was not afraid of any man breathing, he would fight even
for £5; his friends were still ready to back him for £200 against the
Champion, Ward. This speech, given in Burke’s sincere but blunt style,
excited warm applause, and a pledge was given that his benefit should be
well attended.</p>

<p>It was then suggested that the title of Champion of England ought not
to depend on the capricious will of the person by whom it had been
obtained, putting the sum at which he would risk its loss so high as to
prevent the possibility of fair competition. Ward had gradually risen in
his own estimation from £200 to £500, and he might, with as good a grace,
if it depended on himself, say he would not fight for less than £1,000 or
£10,000, and thus retain an honour to which other men might be entitled.
This opinion seemed to meet the almost unanimous concurrence of the
persons present, among whom were Spring, Jem Burn, Ned Neale, Young
Dutch Sam, Dick Curtis, Owen Swift, Smith, Young Spring (Harry
Wood, of Liverpool), and others, and a great number of amateurs and
liberal supporters of the Ring. After some discussion, the following resolution
was moved and seconded:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Resolved&mdash;&#8203;That, in future, the <em>maximum</em> stake at which the Champion
of England shall be considered bound to accept a challenge shall be £200;
and that if he refuse to fight for this sum, he shall be considered as no
longer holding the title of Champion.”
</p>
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pageno">132</span>

<p>A gentleman proposed as an amendment that the sum should be
£250, but this was negatived by a large majority, and the original resolution
was carried with acclamation.</p>

<p>It was then moved and seconded&mdash;&#8203;“That if Jem Ward refuses to fight
Deaf Burke for £200, he shall no longer be considered Champion of
England, but that Burke shall assume the title, until bound to yield to a
man of greater merit.” This resolution was also carried unanimously.</p>

<p>These resolutions are certainly in the spirit of common sense, and if
Ward’s situation in life placed him above the necessity of considering
himself any longer a member of the Ring, it was no more than fair&mdash;&#8203;as in
the case of the veteran Tom Cribb and his successor Tom Spring&mdash;&#8203;that he
should retire; a step which certainly could not have stripped him of any
of the honours to which he had previously entitled himself.</p>

<p>The disappointed Deaf’un now repaired to Liverpool, and departing
thence, like another Childe Harold, “he sung, or might, or could, or
should, or would have sung”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>And so “Childe Burke” did, after a pleasant tour, in which he always
spoke as receiving warm welcome and hospitality from the Americans;
although, as we shall presently see, upon the unanswerable testimony of
their own papers, the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">perfervidum ingenium</span> of certain emigrant Hibernian
rowdies proved the prudence of Burke’s friends when they declined a contest
on the Curragh of Kildare.</p>

<p>After a brief stay in New York, where he was well received, Burke did
not find any regular “professional” inclined to test his pugilistic capabilities,
and, after duly acknowledging the good spirit in which he had
been received, he announced, that, in compliance with “a vaunting challenge
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">133</span>
in a New Orleans paper, in which O’Rourke was stated to be resident
in that city, and ready to meet any man in the world,” he, the
Deaf’un, had determined on a southward trip, and to drop down on Mr.
O’Rourke on the scene of his glory. As the Deaf’un always meant
what he said, and, himself unconscious of foul play, did not suspect it in
others, he sailed for the city of swamps and slavery.</p>

<p>He had reckoned, in his simplicity, that a stranger would have fair play,
as with Englishmen, but soon found out his egregious mistake. As we
desire the character of an impartial historian, we shall merely extract the
account of this affair from the <cite>Charleston Courier</cite> of May 13th, 1837
which gives the account under date of New Orleans, May 6th:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<span class="sc">Fighting Riots</span>, &amp;c.&mdash;&#8203;For some two or three days past, large numbers
of our population have been thrown into considerable excitement
by handbills posted up in bar-rooms and at the corners of the streets,
that a pugilistic combat was to take place yesterday between two celebrated
prize-fighters, Deaf Burke, an Englishman, and O’Rourke, an
Irishman. The fight between the rival champions, as they style themselves,
took place at about one o’clock, at the forks of the Bayou Road.
Some two or three rounds were fought, which resulted particularly to the
advantage of neither of the belligerents. The second of O’Rourke, happening
to come within hitting distance of Burke, received a severe blow
from the Deaf-man himself. Whether this was right or wrong, not being
at the fight, we know not. At any rate it was the signal for a general
scrimmage, in which the Irishmen joined the O’Rourke party, and handled
Burke and his friends with fists and sticks made of anything but dough
and molasses. O’Rourke’s second was settled down by a settler from
Burke’s own fist, when the Deaf-man, thinking his heels better preservatives
of his face and feelings than his fists, took the leg-itimate course
adopted by all men and animals when assaulted by a superior force.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Matters were now coming to a fine pass. Burke was followed by
crowds of Irishmen with shillelaghs, dray-pins, whips, and what not. A
friend, on seeing him pass, handed him a bowie-knife, and another gave
him a horse, with which he made good his escape.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Of the different riots which took place at the scene of action we were
not witnesses. Some say there was foul play on the part of O’Rourke’s
friends, and especially by his second, and that it was intended long before the
fight took place that Burke should get a thrashing by foul or fair means.
The man who handed Burke the knife was cruelly beaten by the infuriated
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
friends of O’Rourke: it is reported, and we fear with much truth, that he
was killed.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“O’Rourke’s friends bore him about our streets in triumph yesterday
afternoon in a coach drawn by themselves.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On the arrival of the different parties in town, inflamed with liquor
and ready for any disturbance, many affrays occurred. During the whole
afternoon, large numbers of malcontents, principally Irishmen, were congregated
in the vicinity of the Union House, and Armstrong’s, opposite
the American Theatre. Several serious and disgraceful fights took place,
in some of which the rascally mob beat and otherwise maltreated a number
of innocent and unoffending individuals. A large number of arrests
were made.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The reports in town of the loss of lives, and of the results of the wild
spirit of anarchy and confusion which existed in the afternoon, are so
various, so contradictory, that we cannot comment upon them. The whole
affair was disgraceful in the extreme.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Washington Guards were ordered out at eight o’clock last evening
by the Mayor to quell any disturbance which might arise. As late as
two o’clock this morning everything was comparatively quiet.”</p>

<p>Thus it would seem that the affair ended in a complete Irish row, in
which the lawless habits of “the Knights of the Shillelagh” put all fair
play at defiance. We hope we are not open to a charge of national prejudice,
but would fairly put the question, “Would such ruffianism&mdash;&#8203;and
ruffianism is always cruel and cowardly&mdash;&#8203;be possible among a people
imbued with the fair-play practices and the principles inculcated by
regulated pugilism?”</p>

<p>Some anxiety was caused in London by a rumour in a New York paper,
that the Deaf’un had received his “quietus” not with “a bare bodkin”
but an “Arkansas tooth-pick;” much relief therefore, was felt by them
on finding from the Charleston papers that he was still in the land of the
living, and had returned to New York; not finding his life safe among a
set of men who considered a challenge to their “Champion” as an
individual, a national insult, to be wiped out by assassination.</p>

<p>That he had returned in safety was shown by scattered notices in the
New York papers, from which we gather that one O’Connell, who, like his
namesake on this side the Atlantic, was “an out-and-out big potato,” had
challenged the Deaf’un for 500 dollars and “the honour of ould Ireland,”
to a fistic tourney. This Burke had accepted, and Elizabeth Town Point
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pageno">135</span>
was named as the field of battle. A sheriff’s notice, in anticipation of another
Irish riot, compelled a change of ground to Hart’s Island, which was
reached by a steam excursion, and here the affair came off without interruption.
What follows is from the <cite>New York Herald</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The ‘Prize Ring,’ as it is emphatically called, is not without its merits,
and although we regret and detest these exhibitions&mdash;&#8203;when as exhibitions
merely&mdash;&#8203;our duty as chroniclers of passing events compels us to make public
what otherwise we should bury in oblivion. Among the ancients these
spectacles were frequent, and cherished by the government of the people
indulging in them; and it is yet doubtful whether they do not in some
degree tend to benefit the community at large. There is a feeling of
courage&mdash;&#8203;of proud, manly self-dependence&mdash;&#8203;accompanying the champions of
the Ring, that otherwise would not be elicited. The manly stand-up fight is
surely far preferable to the insidious knife&mdash;&#8203;the ruffianly gang system&mdash;&#8203;or
the cowardly and brutal practice of biting, kicking, or gouging, now so
prevalent. The ancient Romans conquered and civilised half the world,
and it is to them we owe the gladiatorial spectacle of the Prize Ring&mdash;&#8203;modified
by modern civilisation, but yet retaining sufficient of its origin to
portray the manners and habits of the people among whom it has taken
root. The British people are particularly fond of this exhibition, and there
are some good consequences attending it. The street broil or hasty
quarrel is deprived of half its ferocity. Three or four or more do not fall
upon and beat a single individual. None but gangs of ruffians can commit
such deeds. The single man when struck down by his opponent is permitted
to rise and put himself, as it were, in something like equilibrium
with his opponent. Stamping upon a man when down&mdash;&#8203;biting, kicking,
and other such ‘courageous’ displays are entirely exploded; and when the
party combating cries ‘hold, enough,’ no bowie-knife enters his vitals, or
proves the superior courage of his opponent by depriving him of existence.
With all its disadvantages, therefore, and demoralising tendency, as contended,
and perhaps truly so, it may be doubted whether the spirit emanating
from it may not be productive of benefit among the lower classes.
The knock-down blow is surely preferable to private assassination, or even
to the open taking of human life by means of deadly weapons. Quitting
these reflections, let us give our account of the fight itself.</p>

<p>“At nine o’clock the steamboat left the ferry (Catharine Street), with
about three hundred passengers, and those of a very select kind, owing
principally, perhaps, to the high price demanded for tickets&mdash;&#8203;three dollars,
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pageno">136</span>
which speedily rose to four and five dollars, and even at that price could
not be procured. The destination was Hart’s Island, where the passengers
were landed and the preliminary measures to the ‘set-to’ adopted. A
twenty-four feet ring, according to the articles of agreement, was formed,
and an outside one to prevent any interruption to the pugilistic efforts of
the combatants. The ring being completed, and the seconds proclaiming
‘all ready,’ the two champions made their appearance&mdash;&#8203;O’Connell, as the
challenger, threw his hat first in the ring, which was quickly answered by
Burke; the men then peeled for the battle.</p>

<p>“On stripping, the great disparity between the two men was apparent.
Burke presented an iron frame, in which all surperfluous flesh seemed
excluded. His broad and extended chest, his outward turned knees, that
take off from beauty to add so much to muscular power, his muscular and
well-knit lower limbs left no doubt on the minds of the spectators that no
common skill or bodily strength would be sufficient to overpower or vanquish
the possessor. O’Connell stripped to greater advantage than was
expected. His upper frame is large and muscular, but it wants compactness
and tension. His sinews hang loose, and his frame is far from being
well banded together. In his lower conformation this defect is still more
striking; this is his weak point, and must ever incapacitate him from
becoming a redoubtable competitor in the Prize Ring. ‘All ready’ being
proclaimed by the respective seconds (Abm. Vanderzee and Alexander
Hamilton officiating for O’Connell, and Hatfield and Summerdyke for
Deaf Burke), the opponents previously shaking hands, put themselves in
attitude for the onset.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;The men came up, each equally
confident. Some sparring took place which
only tended to show in a more striking point
the disparity of the pugilists. The quick eye
of Burke immediately discovered that he had
the game in his hands, and he accordingly
forebore any active exertion, threw his body
open, which O’Connell immediately caught at,
and implanted two heavy blows&mdash;&#8203;one immediately
beneath the ribs, and the second on the
loins of his adversary. Burke received this
infliction without the slightest variation of
muscle or feature&mdash;&#8203;and in return put forth a
feeler (left hand) which dropped O’Connell
at his full length. Some of Burke’s friends
cheered&mdash;&#8203;this was instantly stopped by the
umpires, who requested that, let the fight
terminate how it might, no ebullition of the
feelings of either party should be suffered to
take place. All, upon this appeal, were immediately
silent.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Both men were equally confident.
O’Connell smiled, as much as to say “I
stoop to conquer.” Burke made play; O’Connell
struck a well-meant left-handed compliment
to Burke’s knowledge-box, which
was prettily stopped. Burke returned with
right, in part husbanding his strength; the
blow told slightly on O’Connell’s bread-basket&mdash;&#8203;a
wrestle&mdash;&#8203;O’Connell down. First
blood was here claimed by each party. The
umpires decided that both sported the claret
simultaneously&mdash;&#8203;thus deciding all wagers on
this matter.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Burke appeared brooding mischief.
O’Connell struck a random blow and lost his
guard, when Burke immediately put in his
tremendous right-handed blow, which taking
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pageno">137</span>
effect under the ear of O’Connell, floored
him as if struck by lightning.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Time being called, O’Connell courageously
rose to the scratch, but had scarcely
left his second’s knee, when he fell as if
through weakness. The fight was here
claimed by the friends of Burke; the
umpires, however, decided “not lost,” and
the fifth round commenced.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;O’Connell tried a new mode, and went
boldly into his man. He succeeded in planting
a pretty severe body-blow on Burke,
closed for the wrestle, but was thrown&mdash;&#8203;he
fell slightly, however.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Burke piped a trifle. O’Connell made
a rush&mdash;&#8203;got well in for the close, but the
superior strength of Burke shook him off.
O’Connell seemed spent, was entirely off his
guard, and Burke could easily have concluded
the fight by any blow he chose to have put
in; but, seeing the disabled state of O’Connell,
Burke unclosed his fist, and with the
back of his open hand struck O’Connell in
the breast, which dropped him as a man
might be supposed to push down a child. A
low exclamation of approbation, impossible
to repress, ran through the spectators at the
manliness of this conduct.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;O’Connell seemed to be gaining
strength, and fought this round most manfully.
It was evident, nevertheless, that his
faulty method of delivering his blows could
never win him the day. Three severe
blows were delivered by Burke in succession,
on the head, chest, and loins of
O’Connell, who made a sort of headlong
rush, closed with Burke, bore him towards
the ropes, and was thrown heavily in the
wrestle.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Hatfield, the second of Burke, here
said, “He’s finished, polish him off.” O’Connell
came up staggering&mdash;&#8203;Burke made a feint,
and prepared to strike a finisher. From
humanity, however, he did not deliver his
blow&mdash;&#8203;O’Connell closed&mdash;&#8203;a short rally took
place, and O’Connell was thrown.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;O’Connell showed some game, but it
was evidently of an expiring effort. He
faced his man, made a blow, which fell short,
and was met by Burke with a terrible facer,
which set the claret flowing in a rapid stream
from O’Connell’s nostrils. All was over.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Time was repeatedly called. O’Connell
rose but could not stir a step towards his
man. Burke said, “I wish to fight honourable&mdash;&#8203;I
will not strike him&mdash;&#8203;does your man wish
to fight any more?” O’Connell’s second immediately
gave in the battle, and Burke was
declared the conqueror.</p>

<p>     A word or two respecting the rival combatants:
O’Connell never was or can be
capable of figuring with credit as a fighter.
He wants bottom, activity, and science&mdash;&#8203;three
things which are indispensable in the
formation of a boxer. From the third round
he had not the slightest chance of winning&mdash;&#8203;it
was a doubloon to a shin-plaster, and no
takers. The day was peculiarly propitious,
and the company of a very respectable description.
Those who conducted this affair
deserve all praise. Not the slightest disturbance
of any kind took place. It was what
the Prize Ring ever ought to be&mdash;&#8203;an exhibition
of manly and courageous contest.”</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>We need add nothing to this “round, unvarnished tale,” written by a
literary gentleman who had never before witnessed a prize-fight. In
Burke, his Irish opponent found, notwithstanding his foul treatment at
New Orleans, a brave and humane antagonist; and that, despite the contaminating
effects of bad example, the Deaf’un preserved in the New
World the high and generous qualities he exhibited in his own country.
Cant, cruelty, and cowardice have crushed out the courageous confidence
in the unarmed fist as the weapon in hand-to-hand encounters, and the
American populace trust for victory to the bowie-knife and the revolver,
when man opposes man to settle their personal differences “in a higher
phase of civilisation.” (?)</p>

<p>As the patrons of the Ring are, such will its professors be, holds good as
an axiom in pugilism as in every other science. A few unprejudiced and
enlightened Americans, seeing the horrors and savagery of Irish-American
rowdyism, entertained the milling missionary, and strove to propagate his
principles, but were in a minute and powerless minority among a multitude
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pageno">138</span>
of howling saints and savages&mdash;&#8203;for extremes meet in this as in all other
things. To these friends and sympathisers Burke bade an affectionate
farewell, after a handsome benefit, and arrived at Liverpool on the 25th
of June, 1838.</p>

<p>During the Deaf’un’s absence some pretentious “big ones” had been
coming into prominent notice. Bendigo, Ben Caunt, and Brassey had
become famous, and not a few of their several partisans thought either one
or the other more than a match for the Deaf’un. It was whispered, too,
and too truly, that his rupture had been aggravated by an accident, and that
his habits in America had not been such as would improve his constitution or
stamina. Indeed, some of those deepest in Ring mysteries declared his
reappearance in the Ring more than questionable. The gallant fellow himself
had no such misgivings, and lost no time in so telling his countrymen.</p>

<p class="center">“THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF ENGLAND.</p>

<p class="center">“<i>To the Editor of</i> ‘<span class="sc">Bell’s Life in London</span>.’</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;&#8203;When I was in Yankeeshire I heard a great deal about ‘would-be champions’
challenging any man in England. ‘While the cat’s away the mice will play;’ and thus the
little fry took advantage of my absence to bounce and crow like cocks in a gutter. I
hastened back to take the shine out of those braggadocios; and to put their pretensions to
the test, I beg to state that I am now ready to fight any man in England for from One
Hundred to Five Hundred Pounds; and as my old friend Jem Ward has retired from the
Ring, if he will add his Champion’s belt to the prize, and let the best man wear it, he will
give new energies to the Ring, and, I trust, afford an opportunity for deciding the long-contested
question, ‘Who is Champion of England?’ I bar neither country nor colour&mdash;&#8203;age
nor dimensions; and whether it be the Goliath Caunt, or his hardy antagonist Bendigo,
or any other man who ever wore a head, I am his customer, and ‘no mistake.’ My money
is ready at Jem Burn’s, the ‘Queen’s Head,’ Queen’s Head Court, Windmill Street, Haymarket,
at a moment’s notice; but I will not consent to a less deposit that £25 at starting.
If I find the race of old English boxers of the right kidney is extinct, I shall go back to
America, where an honest man need never want ‘a friend or a bottle.’</p>

</div><!--end letter-->

<p>As we have already recorded in our memoir of Bendigo, the Nottingham
hero lost no time in accepting this challenge, and stated he had placed
£100 in the hands of Peter Crawley to make the match. Unfortunately
for the Deaf’un’s reputation, he had, through his intimacy with Young
Dutch Sam, become entangled in a vicious companionship, as the humble
“pot-companion” and gladiatorial buffoon of a clique of dissolute young
noblemen and swells, the last expiring parodists of the school of which
“Corinthian Tom” and “Jerry Hawthorn” were the models. By these
and their companions he was carried off to France, on the pretext of
training and seconding Owen Swift in his second fight with Jack Adams,
and much obloquy was cast on him unjustly, under a supposition that he
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pageno">139</span>
had run away from his engagements. A “Paris Correspondent” transmitted
the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<span class="sc">Paris</span>, June  14.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un arrived in this city on Sunday, under
the <em>Mentorship</em> of Sancho Panza, from Seven Dials, a ‘buck’ of the first
water. He met Swift on the Boulevard des Italiens, and was so affected
at the interview with this interesting <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exile</span>, that the water came from his
eyes like the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jet d’eau</span> in the Temple Gardens. As the speediest mode of
acquiring an acquaintance with the French language, he lives entirely on
<span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fricandeau de dictionnaire</span>. He has already won the affections of a grisette
by his very natural imitation of the statue of Cupid. He afterwards tried
the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Venus de Medici</span>, but that was a decided failure. He has been favourably
received by the patrons of British Sports in the French capital, but
it is feared he cannot be presented at the Court of Louis Philippe, in consequence
of his having neglected to present himself at the Drawing-room
of our lovely young Queen. In a visit to the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin des Plantes</span>, he thought
he recognised a young brother, but on closer inspection he discovered it
was only the chimpanzee. He appears to be regarded with as much
curiosity in Paris as Soult was in London, and expected the old Marshal
would have given him ‘a Wellington reception,’ but hitherto the gallant
veteran has not recognised him as ‘a companion in arms.’ His presence
has already had an influence on the fashions, and ‘<span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pantalons à la Burke</span>’
have made their appearance in the Palais Royal, while ‘<span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gantelets à la
Deaf’un</span>’ are noted as a novelty in <cite>Le Courrier des Salons</cite>.”</p>

<p>We have already noticed in our memoir of Bendigo that the Deaf’un
did not return from his continental trip until, after training Owen Swift,
and seconding him on the 5th of September, 1838, he again sought the
shores of England, lest he should receive the “polite attentions” of the
French authorities for his share in that “scandal,” as the Paris correspondent
of “My Grandmother” styled it. The staunchness of poor
Burke’s “summer friends” was now tested. They had withdrawn the
£100 placed in Jem Burn’s hands, but, after some negotiation, the match
was made, Burke posting £100 to Bendigo’s £80, and on the 29th of
February, 1839, the rivals met. The full details of the Deaf’un’s defeat
may be read in <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 16&ndash;22.</p>

<p>The reflection is here unavoidably thrust upon us, that the so-called
“friends” of an athlete, if they by their own loose habits seduce him into
similar irregularities, are his worst enemies. What is sport to them is ruin
to him. Temperance, regularity of living, open air exercise, and severe
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pageno">140</span>
attention to the wellbeing of every bodily function that goes to build up
health&mdash;&#8203;the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">mens sana in corpore sano</span>&mdash;&#8203;can never be neglected without
ruinous consequences; and thus fell the brave and imprudent Deaf’un, the
victim of the follies of those the world miscalled “his betters.” A few
quatrains on his downfall shall find a place here.</p>

<p>That “next chance,” as Edgar Poe’s raven said, “never, never, never
more” came to the turn of the Deaf’un, so far as regarded a meeting with
Bendy, although he issued sundry invitations and offers. In March, 1840,
occurred the accident to Bendigo, narrated at page 25, which struck the
Nottingham hero from the list of “wranglers” for the Championship,
and hereupon Burke again came to the front with a challenge. This was
quickly responded to by Nick Ward, the younger brother of the renowned
Jem. The match was made for the modest sum of £50 a side, and the
day fixed for Tuesday, the 22nd September, 1840. The battle, which took
place at Lillingstone Level, Oxfordshire, will be found in detail in the
Life of Nick Ward, Chapter <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> of the present volume.</p>

<p>Poor Burke’s day was gone by; unconquered in heart, his impaired
physical powers failed him, and he fell before youth, activity, skill, and
length. As we have mentioned in our memoir of Nick Ward that the
stakeholder received notice of action for the stakes, it is but just to give
the following vindication of the Deaf’un’s conduct as reported in a contemporary
journal:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<span class="sc">The Deaf’un Himself Again!</span>&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un took a benefit at the
Bloomsbury Assembly Rooms on Tuesday evening, and, notwithstanding
his late defeat, found a goodly number of friends, and ‘a strong turn’ in
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pageno">142</span>
the financial department. The sets-to, although many of them between
commoners, were amusing and effective, and conducted with great spirit
and vigour. Among the most popular was that between Owen Swift and
Maley, in which the quickness and scientific deliveries of the former were
happily illustrated. At the conclusion the Deaf’un mounted the stage to
‘wind-up,’ but unfortunately, Caunt having forfeited his promise to appear,
he was only opposed to a new beginner called ‘The Cumberland Youth,’
whose inexperience left the star of the night nothing to do but flap him at
pleasure. The Deaf’un, after smoothing down his bristles with his dexter
digits, and clearing his throat by sundry ‘hems,’ delivered himself of the
following oration, which we took down as nearly as could be verbatim.
’Gemmen&mdash;&#8203;I have dis here to say. I’m werry sory as Caunt has not
come to sets-to wid me according to his promises, for he gave me his
words of honours as he would attend; but dats de way wid dese here mens&mdash;&#8203;when
dey gets to the top of de trees, dey do nothing to help a poor fellow
as is down; but dey had better minds what dey are abouts, or they’ll be as
bad as Jack Scroggins, and look for a <em>tanners</em> when they can’t find it.
Gemmen&mdash;&#8203;I mean to say as I do not thinks as I was fairly beat
by Bendigo, and I am prouds to say as I am not widout friends what tink
de same, and as are ready to back me for a cool hundreds against him, or
Nick Wards, or Jem Bailey. Bendigo is wery bounceable now, as he says
he has licked me; but I says he took an unfair advantage in regard of my
belt; but dats neither one ting nor toder; and if he has friends, if he’s a
man, he’ll give me anoder chance, and till he does, I shall always thinks as
he has won de belts widout any right to it. I went to Sheffields and Nottinghams
to make a match wid him, and now let him show equal pluck
and come to London to make a match wid me&mdash;&#8203;my pewters is always
ready (applause). Dat’s all I’ve got to say. Gemmen, I thank my friends
and patrons for coming here to-night (coughing); but I’ve got something
here (pointing to his throat, and the poor fellow appeared overflowing with
gratitude) which won’t let me say no mores.’&mdash;&#8203;It is not very creditable to
the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</span> of the Fancy to have abstained from setting-to for the unfortunate
fellow; for, although his ignorance may have led him to assume too
much, the motto of all professed pugilists should be ‘forget and forgive;’
and ‘if a man’s in distress, like a man to relieve him.’”</p>

<p>In the years 1841&ndash;2, the magistracy and police, stimulated into abnormal
activity by a sort of clerical crusade against the Ring “and all its works,”
set the powers of the law in motion against pugilists and their patrons, and
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pageno">143</span>
“all persons aiding and abetting in riotous and tumultuous assemblages
calculated to produce a breach of the peace,” by issuing warrants, holding
them to bail, and indicting them at the quarter sessions of the county
wherein the same took place. Among the zealots of this Puritanical campaign
against the amusements and relaxations of the people, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Joshua Cautley, curate of Broughton, in Bedfordshire, distinguished himself
with the fervour of Ralpho, the squire of Sir Hudibras; though he,
fortunately, escaped the cudgellings, rotten eggs, and stocks, which in
rougher times befell his prototype. In an evil hour the Deaf’un came in
contact with this clerical suppressor of “anti-knife” congregations, under
the serio-comic circumstances we are about to narrate.</p>

<p>On the 9th of February, 1841, at Holcut, in Bedfordshire, an orderly
assemblage surrounded a well-arranged inner-and-outer ring, within the
latter of which Ned Adams, of London, and Dick Cain, of Leicester, were
contending. At a critical period of the battle, the curate of Broughton,
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Joshua Cautley, who was not, as all the “rurals” surrounding the
ring well knew, either a magistrate in the commission of the peace, or in
any way legally authorised to interfere, appeared at the ring-side in an excess
of peace-preserving furor, and not only attempted to take Adams into
custody (without any warrant), but cut the ropes with a knife, and behaved
otherwise in an outrageous manner. He was afterwards aided by a police
constable (John M’Hugh), and by the arrival of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Edward Orlebar
Smith, a Justice of the Peace for Bedfordshire, previous to whose appearance
on the scene certain of the country people present had certainly
ejected Parson Cautley from the ring. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Justice of the Peace, as
it appears, then put his fellow clergyman and himself on the right side of
the law by reading&mdash;&#8203;at a distance, and amidst immense confusion and the
continuance of the battle&mdash;&#8203;the Riot Act. The result of all this was that
the zealous Parson Cautley procured, upon affidavit sworn by himself, the
constable, and the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Smith, the indictment of thirteen persons
(six of them being his own neighbours) at the ensuing Bedford Quarter
Sessions. The pugilists indicted were James Burke, Owen Swift, Edward
Adams, and Richard Cain, Thomas Brown (the respected landlord of the
“Swan,” at Newport Pagnell, who was there in charge of his post-horses
and four-in-hand), Messrs. Mark Cross, William Maley (a solicitor),
Joseph Goodwin, George Durham, Edward Dawkes, James Morris the
younger, Martin Hughes (who died during the proceedings), and Richard
Walter Chetwynd, Viscount Chetwynd, Baron Rathdowne. The indictment
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pageno">144</span>
charged, in its first count, “that they, the defendants aforesaid, on
the 9th day of February, 1841, in the parish of Holcut, in the county of
Bedford, did then and there, together with other evil-disposed persons,
whose names are unknown to the jurors aforesaid, unlawfully, riotously,
and tumultuously assault Edward Orlebar Smith, clerk, one of the Justices
of the Peace for the said County, and John M’Hugh, one of the constables
of the Peace for the said County, and, then and there, did, in contempt
of our said Lady the Queen and her laws, to the great terror,
alarm, and disturbance of all the liege subjects of our said Lady the Queen
thereabouts inhabiting and residing and being, passing and repassing, to
the great damage of the said Edward Orlebar Smith and John M’Hugh,
and against the peace of our said Lady the Queen her crown and dignity.”
The second count in this formidable document, repeating the names and
verbiage, included the same charges against the defendants for riot and
assault on the person of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Joshua Cautley. The third count varied
by specifying James Burke as the assailant of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Edward Orlebar
Smith (whom he never touched in any way). The 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th
counts merely varied in the names of the parties assaulted, by substituting
“Smith” for “M’Hugh,” and “Cautley” for “Smith,” as the persons on
whom “with force and arms,” the same defendants “did then and there
beat, wound, and ill-treat, and do other wrong, to the great damage of the
said E. O. Smith,” <abbr title="et cetera, et cetera">&amp;c., &amp;c.</abbr>, “and against the peace of our said Lady the
Queen her crown and dignity.”</p>

<p>Any one not used to the formal wording of legal documents may well
share the astonishment of the Deaf’un when this astounding rigmarole,
being furnished to his legal advisers (Mr. Vincent Dowling and Mr. Serjeant
Dowling), was read and explained to him. His truthful and indignant
denials of all the serious delinquencies laid to his charge in this farrago
of legal fictions were most amusing. Perhaps the way in which these
were thrown into rhyme, by what old Jacob Tonson, the bookseller, used
to call “a competent pen,” will convey some idea of the Deaf’un’s objections
and denial of the charges:&mdash;</p>

<p>On Monday, the 14th of March, the Deaf’un, who had been generously
bailed by a couple of Bedford tradesmen, surrendered to his bail, as also
did eleven others. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Cautley, Mr. Orlebar Smith, and “a
cloud of witnesses,” policemen, and others. Tom Spring, in friendly consideration
of the Deaf’un’s incapacity of hearing, stood by him as <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">amicus
curiæ</span>, and kindly interpreted the proceedings. It should be stated that in
his examination before Lord Charles F. Russell and the grand jurors, the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Joshua had stated that “Burke had endeavoured to force him out of
the ring, and had seized him by the leg to throw him over the ropes.” Of
this the Deaf’un (who certainly was never in the ring at all) was nervously
anxious to exculpate himself. What was his surprise then to learn that
“no evidence would be offered on that point,” and that “the general charge
implicated all present in the same guilt.” Eventually (Viscount Chetwynd
having removed the trial of his indictment into the Court of Queen’s
Bench, on the ground that he could not get an impartial trial in Bedfordshire)
the trials were postponed, and the whole of the defendants were
held to bail to appear at the summer assizes; to them a ruinous expense
and miserable suspense, and the great satisfaction of their Christian
prosecutors and the profit of sundry attorneys; and thus ended the first
“field-day” of “the battle of Bedford.” Other separate indictments,
however, were proceeded with, against Messrs. Brown, of the “Swan,”
Newport Pagnell, George Durham, Edward Dawkes, and Mark Cross, for
“refusing to assist the constable in the execution of his duty.” Mr.
Brown, after evidence by M’Hugh, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Joshua Cautley, and Mr.
Smith, that in reply to being so called upon, he replied (being seated on
the box of his coach) “that he had to mind his horses,” was found
guilty. The other defendants then, having pleaded “guilty,” were sentenced
each to pay a fine of forty shillings, and costs, and to enter into
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pageno">147</span>
recognisances themselves in £40, and two sureties in £20 each, “to be of
good behaviour for one year.” The fines were paid, the sureties given,
and the defendants liberated from that charge. In July the unlucky
defendants again surrendered, when their trial was again postponed to
await the result of the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">certiorari</span> by which the aristocratic defendants
(Viscount Chetwynd and Mr. Maley, the solicitor) had removed their cases
to the Court of Queen’s Bench. These having failed, in the ensuing
November, Burke and his fellow victims of the law’s delay were placed at
the bar. In the interim we find in the <cite>Bedford Mercury</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<span class="sc">Prize Fight and Lord Chetwynd.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Lord Charles Russell laid before
the Court a statement showing the position of the prosecution against Burke
and thirteen others, for a riot at a prize fight at Holcut, in this county, and
did so to know whether the prosecution should be proceeded in. Already
an expense of £50 had been incurred, and probably between £80 and £90,
exclusive of witnesses, would be further required. By a writ of <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">certiorari</span>
Lord Chetwynd had traversed the case to the Court of Queen’s Bench, to
obtain the privilege of not pleading on the trial in the usual way by holding
up his hand. The other parties accused had not been aware of the object
of the course taken by Lord Chetwynd, and were in the same position as
they were before traversing to the superior court. The county was at a
great expense, and the defendants must have been at double the expense.
His lordship also laid before the Court a correspondence between Lord
Chetwynd and that gentleman, expressing his regret at what had occurred.
Mr. Smith was not satisfied with the correspondence, and the opinion of the
Court was that the prosecution should be continued, having begun it.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“From this we infer that the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Smith is not satisfied with the
apology tendered by Lord Chetwynd, and that to satisfy his feelings, the
county and the defendants are to be involved in a still heavier outlay.
To those who were in no respect consenting to Lord Chetwynd’s determination,
this seems a measure of cruelty for which we were not prepared; but
it would seem that after having already entered into recognisances to
appear and take their trials, and having strictly and respectfully complied
with that undertaking, from whence they were relieved by no act of their
own, they are again called on to put in fresh bail in the Court of Queen’s
Bench at Westminster, some of them living in distant parts of the kingdom.
This may be necessary in form of law; but surely, even the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Smith
can have no wish to add to the hardships of the defendants, who were, and
are still ready to submit to take their trials at the proper season.”
</p>
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pageno">148</span>

<p>This wretched persecution thus dragged its weary length into the following
year, 1842, when negotiations for a compromise having been made
between the Crown solicitors and those of the defendants, Mr. Gurney, on
the part of “Burke, Adams, Cain, and others,” said he was instructed to
withdraw their plea of “not guilty,” and to accept a verdict for the Crown
against his clients.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrews thereon, on the part of the magistrates, thought the defendants
had pursued a very proper course, and the prosecution was withdrawn;
so that this expensive performance of “Much Ado about Nothing,”
ended by Messrs. Cautley and Smith “taking nothing by their motion,”
the defendants being put to a heavy expense, and an outlay of some hundreds
of pounds (raised by benefits and public subscriptions of the admirers of
British boxing, and the sympathisers with the unfortunate victims of Puritanical
persecution) to the profit of lawyers. At the opening of these
assizes Baron Gurney made the following significant remark, with which
we will conclude these instructive legal proceedings for the suppression of
pugilistic encounters: “His lordship, in discharging the grand jury, said,
that although the number of cases in the calendar was not greater than
was usual at the spring assizes, yet he regretted to see that the character of
many of the offences was of a most aggravated description, and that there
was no less than six charges of <em>maliciously cutting and wounding</em> in the
calendar. His lordship said that this offence of using deadly weapons in
personal quarrels appeared to be very much on the increase, that it
was a disgrace to the character of the country, and that it must be put
down.”</p>

<p>In May, 1842, the Deaf’un was matched with the Tipton Slasher
(William Perry), but at the fourth deposit, which was appointed to be
made at Owen Swift’s on July 7th, when “Time” was called, and Burke’s
“needful” ready, no one appeared on behalf of the Tipton, and Burke
was thereon declared entitled to the forfeit of the £15 down. Johnny
Broome, as the representative of Perry, afterwards made his appearance,
but Burke’s friends declared the business closed, and refused to reopen
the affair. And thus ended the Deaf’un’s last attempt to get paired with
either of “the big ’uns,” who at this period preferred their questionable
claims to the tarnished honours of the “Championship.”</p>

<p class="unindent">poor Jem now became the plaything, but never the parasite, of a knot of
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">149</span>
men about town, supplementing their questionable patronage by giving
lessons in boxing, and conducting the room at his early patron’s (Joe
Parish, the waterman and pugilist) who, for many years after his removal
from Strand Lane, kept the “Lion,” at the corner of Newcastle Street,
Strand. The Deaf’un&mdash;&#8203;and we met him often&mdash;&#8203;was always respectable in
appearance and respectful in manner, and out of his small means supported
an aged mother and a humble home.</p>

<p>In his nightly adventures in the vicinity of the Haymarket, Burke was
frequently brought in contact with a big outsider, Bob Castles, well known
at the “playhouses” (not the theatres), in the vicinity of Leicester Square,
at “Goodred’s Saloon,” Jack Rowbottom’s “Finish,” in James Street,
The Elysium, Mother Emerson’s “The Waterford Arms,” and the
numerous nighthouses that then infested and infected the purlieus
of Piccadilly, and disgraced and degraded the very name of a sporting
house. Bob was a great boaster, and on the strength of having stripped
twice in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> (once in August 20, 1827, when he beat Bill Bailey
at Portsmouth Races, and again on April 2, 1828, with Paddy Flynn, at
Colney Heath, when he got “the value of a bating”), he was a sort of
“professional” guide to roysterers out on the spree, and a bully for those
who might hire his services. Bob was, moreover, a great talker, and, to
use a Pierce-Eganism, “flash as the knocker of Newgate.” This worthy
never missed an opportunity of making the naturally good-natured Deaf’un
the butt of his chaff, and even of many rough practical jokes. On one of
these occasions the Deaf’un taking umbrage at what he supposed to
be an interference with some of his “’ticular frien’s,” quietly warned
“Mister Bobs” that if he didn’t mend his manners “he’d jest punch
Mister Bobs’ pimples.” One word begetting another, and the Deaf’un,
considering himself better at an <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">argumentum ad hominem</span> with the
fist than a verbal disputation, dared Castles to the field; the latter
ridiculed the idea, and several of those present agreeing that a good
licking mutually administered might do good to both of them, a
deposit was made to be increased to £50, and that the veterans should
have the opportunity of displaying their courage and settling their difference
of opinion, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundem artem</span>, with Nature’s original weapons. To
afford them an opportunity to prepare for their “trial by battle,” three
weeks were allowed for training, and in the interim the wrathful heroes
went under the necessary regimen and exercises, Burke at the “Five
Bells,” Putney, Castles at the pleasant Hill of Richmond. Monday, June
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pageno">150</span>
13th, 1843, was the eventful day. Castles, as the deposits went on, found
no difficulty in collecting his “coriander seed;” but the poor honest
Deaf’un did not find his friends, however prompt to promise when under
the influence of champagne, so ready when its effervescence had subsided
to relieve the mortified feelings of their <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span> by substantial support.
Indeed, he might have miscarried at the time, for, as he told us, he found
no end of difficulty “in raising his winds; all the good ones as used to do
the liberals being gones.” At this juncture Young Dutch Sam kindly
stepped in and posted the “possibles,” but at the expense of several
town visits by the Deaf’un, which consumed hours that would have been
more advantageously devoted to improving his bodily condition. In truth,
Burke had outlived his fistic fame; and, although the hero of some twenty
battles, it was considered that the steel had been taken out of him, and
that his renewed appearance in the milling arena would be a mere impotent
exhibition of departed powers. Despite of the difficulties he had to
encounter, and the low estimate of his capabilities entertained by many,
he sustained the character for hardihood, steadiness, and cunning tact that
served him so well in days gone by. As to Castles, his height (nearly six
feet) and superior activity were considered strong points in his favour.</p>

<p>At the last deposit it was agreed between Young Dutch Sam and Mr.
Edward Lacey, the host of the “Garrick’s Head” tap&mdash;&#8203;to whom the
fortunes of Bob Castles had been entrusted&mdash;&#8203;that a trip down the river
was the most prudent mode of bringing matters to a conclusion, and for this
purpose the “Nymph,” Woolwich steamer, was duly chartered, and
directed to be moored off Waterloo Bridge on the morning of battle at
eight o’clock. The “skipper” was punctual to his appointment, and soon
after that hour the men and their partisans were safely embarked. Of
the latter the muster was limited, but among them were a few “Corinthians,”
whose appearance belied the conclusion that they had “risen with
the lark,” although we opine they had not placed themselves in a position
to render rising necessary. At a quarter after eight the craft was under
weigh for London Bridge, whence, after a passing call, she proceeded to
Blackwall, and there having taken in a few of “the right sort,” pursued
her downward course. The Deaf’un was a little crusty on his supposed
exclusion from a due share of the profits of the boat, but in this he was
overruled. There was one point, however, upon which he was inexorable,
namely, that, “as he was outs on a parties of pleasures,” he would “go
the whole hogs,” and not stop short of Gravesend, where he expected to
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pageno">151</span>
find Young Dutch Sam and some friends. He had no objection, however,
having seen them, to “try backs, and fight on the roads homes, instead of
dropping downs to the Lower Hopes,” the vicissitudes attending on the
last trip to which locality was still fresh in his as well as our recollection.
Accordingly, to Gravesend the “Nymph” pursued her voyage.
Here Sam was found, but his state of health was such as to render his
embarkation indiscreet. Little time was lost in “putting about,” and
finally dropping anchor at Rainham Ferry, on the Essex shore, nearly
opposite Erith, the belligerents and their followers were quickly landed,
and the coast being clear, the ring was formed on a fine piece of turf
behind the bank, a snug public-house affording the men a convenient
resting-place till all was ready. Of betting on the voyage down we heard
but little, and this at “evens,” the Deaf’un sporting his “last solitary
shilling” on himself.</p>

<p>The Commissary having discharged his functions, aided by Tom Callas,
and provided seats for the limited assemblage of spectators, the combatants
were summoned to the scratch, and forth they came, nothing loth; Burke
attended by Cullen and Jerry Donovan, and Castles by Tom Reidie and
Fuller. On stripping, Burke looked as full in flesh and as prominent in
muscle as when personating Hercules in his celebrated representation of
the Grecian Statues. He stated he weighed 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, and stood 5<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> 8<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr>
Castles was not so heavy, barely weighing 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>; but he had the advantage
in height, being 5<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> 11in; his length taking from his width, he looked
thin, but he was evidently in good health. There was a speck in one of
his eyes, but he said it did not interfere with his vision, so that there was
no fear of his antagonist getting on his “blind side.” “Richard’s himselfs
agains,” said the great disciple of Shakspeare, and at twenty minutes to
two both men advanced, having previously tied their colours to the stakes
(blue bird’s eye for the Deaf’un, and white bird’s eye for Castles), and
tendering the hand of good fellowship, commenced</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Odds, 5 to 4 on the Deaf’un.
A few leary dodges, each feeling for an opening,
and the Deaf’un expanding his chest and
stretching his <em>pounders</em> from the shoulders,
as if to give them freedom and elasticity.
Castles tried his left, but was stopped; he
then kept feeling for his man, the Deaf’un
waiting, and cautious; nearer and nearer
till at last they got within distance, when
wild and slight counter-hits were exchanged
with the left, then a rush to in fighting; a
few scrambling hits, but no mischief done,
and the Deaf’un dropped on his knees. On
rising, Castles showed a slight discolouration
on the right cheek-bone.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Castles manfully to his work; the
Deaf’un quiet and waiting; Castles short
with his left, and the Deaf’un on the alert;
heavy counter-hitting with the left, and
Burke popped in his favourite right-handed
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pageno">152</span>
hit on the nut. More counter-hitting with
the left; and in the close the Deaf’un was
down, and got up blowing.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Bob, on coming up, showed symptoms
of having received nobbers on the forehead
left and right, and the Deaf’un’s eyes twinkled
as if they had been asked a question. Castles
prompt to the call of “time,” and Burke
steadily but slowly to him. The Deaf’un
tried at the mark with his left, but it was a
mere tap; Bob advanced, the Deaf’un retreating
till they reached the corner, when
Bob let fly his left, catching it severely in
return. A determined rally followed, and
heavy hits were exchanged left and right;
the Deaf’un catching Castles a severe right-handed
hit on the jaw. In the end, the
Deaf’un fell on his knees outside the ropes.
On getting on his “second’s” knees he
pointed to his right arm, as if it had been
shaken in the last round.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Castles advanced; but the Deaf’un
was in no hurry, and waited for him; Castles
delivered his left on the Deafun’s sneezer,
and got back; an exchange of heavy hits
with the left, and Burke again down on his
knees; he was evidently playing the cautious
game.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Burke’s frontispiece slightly disfigured,
and a mouse under his left eye; Castles getting
within distance let go his left, but the
Deaf’un hit with him, and heavy slogging
hits, left and right, followed; a break away,
and again to business; when, after an interchange
of hits, the Deaf’un was down, obviously
stung to some purpose, and Castles
displayed claret from his nose, and showed
marks of heavy nobbing.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Castles hit short with his left, but getting
nearer, heavy counter-hits were exchanged,
when Castles closed with the view
to throwing; Burke attempted to get down,
but Castles held him up by the neck by
main strength for some time with both arms
till he dropped.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Castles again a little out of distance;
the Deaf’un waiting, when counter-hits were
exchanged, and Castles closing, caught his
man on the hip and gave him a heavy fall,
to the dismay of the Deaf’un’s backers.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un came up slow, and suspicions
were afloat that “a screw was loose,”
in fact it was whispered that his rupture was
down, and almost any odds were offered
against him, one gentleman crying 100 to 1,
and no takers; Castles strong on his legs
and full of vigour. He was too cautious,
however, and did not go in with sufficient
determination; he hit short left and right;
counter-hits with the left, and a lively rally,
which ended in Burke going down, apparently
weak.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Burke came up blowing like a grampus,
and again looking at his right arm as
if something was the matter; he tried a
poke at the body with his left, but did not
get home; heavy counter-hits with the left,
and some spirited in-fighting; punishing
blows were exchanged, and in the close,
Burke pursued his getting-down system.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Castles came up with a tremendous
bump over his left eye, which his seconds
ascribed to a butt, and claimed, but the impression
was that as Burke always dropped
his head when he hit with his left, his head
had accidentally come in contact with
Castles’s forehead, but without any intention
to butt, and the claim was not allowed. No
sooner at the scratch, than Castles led off
heavily with the left; sharp counter-hitting
followed, and in the close, Burke down,
Castles on him.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Castles missed his left, and some
severe in-fighting followed; the hits were
quick and heavy; Castles tried for the fall,
but Burke hung on him, and pulled him
down.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Castles popped in a tremendous pop
with the left on the Deaf’un’s mug, and
repeated the dose; the Deaf’un, not to be
deterred, returned the compliment, and
rattling hits followed; in the close the
Deaf’un went down. Castles showed a gash
on the brow, and was otherwise seriously
damaged in the frontispiece, and the spirits
of the Deaf’un’s friends were reviving.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;A magnificent rally, in which the
exchange of hits left and right were really
rapid; in the close, Burke got down; both
were seriously contused, and their phisogs
anything but free from blemish.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Burke came up slow at the call of
time; Castles to him, and led off with his left,
but was stopped; good exchanges left and
right; the Deaf’un looked groggy, but stood
well up, and exchanged hits till he fell;
Castles also fell, and was evidently feeling
the effects of his quick and heavy fighting;
both were seriously punished.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Heavy exchanges left and right; and
in the close, Burke down weak.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Again did the men go to work with
determination, although Burke was slow to
the scratch; Burke delivered a heavy right-handed
fling on Castles’s left ear, which was
much swollen and discoloured, but on Castles
attempting to close, he went down.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Bob planted heavily with his left,
but the Deaf’un stood it like a wood pavement,
and dashed to a rally, in which heavy
jobbing hits were exchanged; Castles grappled
for the fall, but the Deaf’un, too leary,
got down.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Castles missed his left, and the
Deaf’un rushing in with his head down,
Castles caught it under his arm, and giving
him a Cornish hug, threw and fell heavily on
him.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un slow and weak, and five
to one offered on Castles, who although
seriously punished came up strong on his legs,
with nothing like flinching in his demeanour.
Castles missed his left, but the Deaf’un met
him with his left on the nozzle, and drew his
cork; a sharp rally, in which pretty taps
were exchanged; in the end, Burke dropped
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pageno">153</span>
on his knees, but in the act of going down,
he received a whack on the left brow from
Castles’s right, which opened a seam, and
brought the claret in a stream.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Good stopping, when the men got to
a rally, and hit followed hit left and right,
till Burke fell on his knees. Castles had the
bark stripped from his snuffler, and both displayed
such marks of punishment as would
have satisfied any ordinary appetite, and certainly
proved that neither was deficient in
thorough game.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Burke’s left eye, which had received
a second visitation, continued to bleed;
Castles no sooner on his legs than to business,
and delivered his left well on the
Deaf’un’s nose, drawing his cork; this he
repeated, when the Deaf’un rushed to a close,
but Castles slipped aside, and the Deaf’un
fell over on his head.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Heavy exchanges left and right, the
Deaf’un down.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un’s right eyebrow following
suit with his left, both cut, and his nose
assisting to form a trio; heavy counter-hitting
with the left, and pretty exchanges
with the right; Castles down, bleeding from
the nose.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;A terrific rally, in which the punishment
was pretty much on a par; they both
slogged away, till Burke dropped.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Another severe round; Burke was
not to be denied, and the hitting proved
that each was determined to leave his mark,
of which friendly attentions there were
abundant proofs, as both bled profusely, and
displayed a succession of severe contusions,
while Castles’ left eye was fast closing, and
the knuckles of his left hand were considerably
puffed.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Castles came up dripping claret from
sundry springs: Burke, slow, waited his
approach; Castles led off with his left, but
was stopped; tried it again, and got home,
when Burke rushed in with dire intent, but
missed his blow, and Castles as he passed
gave him a back-handed slap with his left;
Burke down on his knees.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Castles hit short, when Burke rushed
in under his arm, and Castles, trying to
grapple, fell over and beyond him.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Castles, after a little dodging, planted
his left; Burke countered, and caught him
another round hit on the ear with his right;
although Burke’s arm was said to be injured
this did not seem to come from a disabled
member, for it shook poor Castles’s dredging
box most woefully; in a scrambling attempt
at a close, Burke got down.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;Castles, bleeding copiously, but still
determined, led off with his left, but Burke
returned left and right; Castles, in getting
away, fell, and the cheers of Burke’s friends
gave him new life.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;It was now clear that Castles’ left
hand was fast going, and from its swollen
state it was plain that it was incapable of
much execution; and the Deaf’un, who
seemed rather to gain than to lose his
strength, was the favourite at 6 to 4. The
Deaf’un, in no hurry, waited for his antagonist’s
approach; Castles let go his left, and
the Deaf’un poked him in return, and after
some good hitting, the Deaf’un got down.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un still on the waiting suit;
Castles not so quick; he found that his
heavy slogging hits made no impression on
the Deaf’un’s iron head; still, after a pause,
he led off with his left, and after a spirited
rally, the Deaf’un was down.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un evidently tired, took
his time in coming to the scratch, and quietly
waited for the attack. Castles at last went
to work, and heavy hits were exchanged,
when in the close both were down, on
Castles being lifted up, although dreadfully
punished, he said “he felt strong,” and
showed no disposition to cry “enough;”
while Burke was equally dogged in his determination.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;A little artful dodging; Castles let
go his left, but Burke ducked, and got away;
Burke in turn rushed in, but Castles retreated;
he then rattled to the charge, but
the Deaf’un slipped down on one knee;
Castles pointed at him with his finger,
instead of hitting him as he might have
done, and exclaimed, “that’s Nick Ward’s
game, stand up and fight like a man;” Burke
grinned, shook his bump of combativeness,
and was carried to his corner.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un extremely deliberate in
his movements, and slow to the scratch.
Castles not so quick as heretofore; after
looking at each other and dodging, Castles
shot out with his damaged left, but was
stopped; a rally and counter-hits exchanged,
when Burke again got down on his knees;
Castles pointed at him derisively, but the
Deaf’un “took a sight” with both hands,
and flourished his digits; Castle walked to
his corner, mortified at Burke’s dropping,
while Burke was carried to his.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;Castles’ left hand getting worse, and
he did not seem inclined to lead off so
quickly as heretofore; the Deaf’un ogled the
damaged fin with great satisfaction, and,
after a short pause, led off with his left, and
planting his blow got down on his knees;
Castles looked “unutterable things,” and,
after regarding him for a moment, gave him
a contemptuous slap on the cheek, at which
the Deaf’un smiled, as much as to admit he
was playing “the artful dodger.”</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un a decided favourite, and
2 to 1 offered on him. He was clearly the
stronger man, while his left hand was still
sound and in working order; on getting up
he waited quietly for the attack, looking
slyly down at Castles’ fist; Castles offered
to commence, but the Deaf’un retreated; a
considerable pause, when Castles led off: the
Deaf’un countered heavily, and after a sharp
rally, in which some severe exchanges took
place, the Deaf’un again got down, still playing
the old soldier.
</p>
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pageno">154</span>

<p>     37 and last.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un pursued his
waiting game, and was clearly gaining
strength; Castles also paused and was in
no hurry to begin; the Deaf’un rubbed his
chest, and then his thatch with both hands,
and grinned, as much as to say, “I’m in no
hurry.” Castles tried a feint with his left,
but if would not do; the Deaf’un was wide
awake, and showed that he was determined
not to throw a chance away. Castles tried
his left at the body, but the blow was not
effectual, at last he let go at the Deaf’un’s
head, and a brisk rally followed, when the
Deaf’un finished the round by giving Castles,
for the first time, a heavy fall. This was the
closing act of the drama. Castles found his
opponent the stronger man, and, from the
state of his left hand, feeling that he had
not a chance, he prudently determined to
give in at once, declaring that fortune was
on the side of his opponent, and he had not
the power to turn the scale. The Deaf’un
immediately approached, they shook hands,
and all was over in <em>one hour and ten minutes</em>.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Both men were immediately conducted to the contiguous public-house,
where every attention was paid to them, and where their wounds were
dressed, and their contusions reduced as much as possible. Poor Castles
was heavily punished, his left eye in total eclipse; his face exhibited not a
square inch without a mark, and a deep incision over the right eye showed
the severity of the Deaf’un’s hitting. His left hand, too, had become
perfectly useless; in truth a more perfect specimen of a courageous
and undaunted submission to hard hitting we have never witnessed&mdash;&#8203;the
best evidence that if by nature timid, by force of mind he
resisted all approach to the charge of cowardice, a species of valour
even more creditable than that which mere instinct and the
gift of creation has planted in the carcases of many animals. Burke had
also what he called his “shares;” but with a hardier and more robust
frame than Castles, as well as a head that might vie in quality with the
rind of a cocoa-nut, his sufferings were not so severe. Yet we doubt
whether in any of his former encounters his receipts were of so severe a
character; he confessed he got much more than he expected, and
was disagreeably surprised at finding “Mister Bobs so dangerous a customers.”</p>

<p>Castles lost this battle principally from his eagerness in the latter part
of the fight, and a want of judgment in not hitting and getting away.
He was too fast, while the Deaf’un cunningly waited and popped him as he
came in, thus giving a sort of double impetus to his deliveries. Had
Castles rattled in with more determination when Burke was amiss, about
the eighth round, the issue might have been different. Burke felt his
position, and had recourse to all the strategems of an old soldier, husbanding
his strength, getting down, and never attempting to wrestle or
unnecessarily exhaust his powers; by this means he preserved his physical
energies, and made the best use of them at the proper time. Castles, on
the contrary, was always first to the call of “time,” and till the last few
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pageno">155</span>
rounds “made all the running,” thereby realising the fable of the hare
and the tortoise. In trying to throw the Deaf’un, too, he diminished his
powers; still, with all this, we are inclined to think, had his left hand not
given way, a result almost inevitable from the frequent repetition of heavy
hits on the Deaf’un’s granite nut, he would have come off victorious; as it
is, with all his faults, he proved himself superior in pluck and moral
courage to most of the modern men of his weight, and deserved the
generous consideration of those who prize such qualities. The Deaf’un
showed unflinching game throughout, and fighting up-hill as he did, with
his right arm seriously, though not fatally damaged, he proved that “all
was not lost that was in danger;” and that in confiding in his tact his
admirers were not trusting to “a broken reed.”</p>

<p>The battle money was given to Burke at Young Dutch Sam’s, the “Old
Drury Tavern,” Brydges Street.</p>

<p>The re-embarkation followed in good order, and all reached Waterloo
Bridge at seven o’clock&mdash;&#8203;the combatants proceeding under the care of
their friends to their respective quarters. As an appropriate <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pendant</span> to

<p>This was the last “flare-up” of the Deaf’un’s pugnacious spirit. Late
hours and long fasts, alternated with creaming sillery, lobster-salads,
devilled biscuits, ditto kidneys, and a deluge of meaner liquors, soon
reduced poor Burke to a shadow of his former self, and he died of consumption
on the 8th of January, 1845, in Francis Street, Waterloo Road.
His good qualities were his own, his vices the grafting of his so-called
“betters” in society.</p>

 This highly reprehensible system of carrying men up to the scratch was subsequently
entirely done away with, as also the system of allowing minute time, another mischievous
practice, which, by giving men more time, enabled them to recover sufficiently to stand and
deliver blows long after their strength and stamina were exhausted. These alterations took
place after the fatal fight between Owen Swift and Brighton Bill, and were attended with
most beneficial results. Half-minute time only was allowed by the New Rules, and if a man
did not <em>walk to the scratch</em> in eight seconds after time was called, he lost the fight.

<h4 class="h4head">WILLIAM PERRY (“THE TIPTON SLASHER”)<br />
1835&ndash;1857.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Although</span> this ungainly specimen of a boxing athlete first saw the
light, in the year 1819, in the town of “the Black Country” from which
his <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de guerre</span> was derived, he came to London and worked in its neighbourhood
at an early age; for, in the year 1835, he was well known in the
neighbourhood of Battersea Fields and Chelsea as a “lumping lad” who,
despite the drawback of “a <sub><span class="larger strong">K</span></sub> leg,” could hit, stop, and use his “fives”
with formidable effect. In November of that year, we read in a sporting
paper:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The admirers of milling in the military village of Chelsea, where
the ‘saloon of arms’ of Alec Reid is a centre of attraction, were all alive
on Tuesday, from the arrangement of a ‘field day’ to decide the best-man
question between two pugilistic heroes of the locality. These were Barney
Dogherty, a sprig from the Emerald Isle, and Bill Perry, a young navvy,
whose displays with his digits, if not quite scientific, are determined and
dangerous. Perry was backed by a sporting butcher, Dogherty by a
circle of his enthusiastic countrymen. In weight the Emeralder had the
advantage of nearly a stone. Each man was waited on by a member of
the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, and the regulations of the Ring carried out.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The fixture was Wimbledon Common, whither miscellaneous groups
were seen wending their way at an early hour; but the police scouts were
wide-awake, and on reaching the intended scene of action it was ‘no go,’
and the disappointed crew looked as blue as their enemies. A move
became inevitable, and new ground was taken opposite the ‘Ship’ at
Mortlake. Here the men set to, but after seven rounds, all in favour of
Perry, the lobsters were again on the scent, and another retreat was made
towards Barnes Common. Here also it would not do&mdash;&#8203;the pursuers were
on the heels of the ‘flying dustmen,’ and a helter-skelter sort of march
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pageno">158</span>
took place over Putney Bridge. Here a council of war was held, and it
was at last agreed to march for Lechmere Common, close to the sporting
grounds of the Baron de Berenger, in the King’s Road. Here all was
right&mdash;&#8203;a fresh ring was formed without interruption, and the sport was
resumed and concluded.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On squaring elbows there was a good deal of sparring, and Perry dodged
left and right. After some heavy exchanges and a rally, Barney was
down weak. The fight was prolonged for six rounds more, during which
Perry had it all his own way, punishing Barney terrifically; still the poor
fellow came up as game as a rhinoceros, and would not give in till his
seconds, seeing he had not a chance, cried ‘enough,’ and his friends were
all satisfied he had done his best to win.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Dogherty turned out to be too stale for active operations; added to
which he is slow and awkward in his style of setting to. Perry is a scientific
hard hitter, but with such a man as Alec Reed, in his day, he would not have
had a chance. Still, in the present state of the Fancy, he is not to be
sneezed at. It was expected a second fight would have taken place between
Middlesex Ben and the Winchester Pet, but the former was ‘shopped.’
Perry can be backed with anybody who may envy his honours, and the
money will be ready at the ‘Lowndes Arms,’ King’s Road, on Tuesday
evening, where Alec Reed gives sparring lectures for the benefit of the
rising generation.”</p>

<p>Such is the account of “The Slasher’s” <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’essai</span>, after which he
seems to have found no candidate for his favours for a twelvemonth, and to
have worked his way towards his native place. Here his fame as a fistic
practitioner was pretty generally acknowledged, and a party of Birmingham
boxers, having among their number Ben Spilsbury (not Charley, who
fought Johnny Broome), being in the town of Tipton exhibiting the art,
young Perry put on the mufflers with that professional. Though the Tipton
lad was not so clever as the Brum, he displayed such determination, and
got so well “on” to his man, that an observation that, “if in earnest,”
Mr. Ben would have to play second fiddle, led to an offer on the part of a
Brum to post a “tenner” upon the experiment. “A friend to sport,” at
the request of Perry, covered the two sovereigns deposited; and as the
Christmas holidays were approaching, December 27th, 1836, was named
as the day of battle. After taking some little liberties with the Tipton in
the opening rounds, for which he occasionally caught a fearful right-handed
visitation, and was rallied down, Spilsbury kept so completely <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</span>
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pageno">159</span>
<span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distance</span> as to deprive the contest of all interest, and finally, at the end of
the 19th round, “cut it,” leaving “The Slasher” in possession of the
field and the stakes.</p>

</div>

<p>After this defeat of Spilsbury, it would appear that the sobriquet of
“The Tipton Slasher” had become the accepted title of William Perry,
for in a local (Staffordshire) paper we find him so described, as being
matched for £25 a side against one Jem Scunner, who is described as the
“Gornel Champion,” a six-foot specimen, weighing 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> odd, and therefore
a fair opponent in height and weight for our hero. The report is
especially meagre, merely informing us that “the battle commenced on
Tuesday (Nov. 22, 1837), near Gornel, but was not decided until the
following day.” The betting at setting to was 6 and 7 to 4 on the Gornel
man. After a few rounds, however, the Gornelites claimed the fight for
their man on the ground of a “foul,” but the referee would not allow it,
and Scunner, by the advice of his friends, would not go on. A rush to
the ring was made, and the referee retired. It was asserted that Perry fell
without a blow. After some wrangling, the referee ordered that the fight
should be renewed on the next day, at Kingswood, near Wolverhampton.
There both men showed at the time appointed, and lost no time in getting
to work. During the first four or five rounds the Gornel man rushed at
the Tipton like a wild bull, but Perry waited for him, shifted cleverly on
his crooked leg, and delivered straight blows and upper-cuts with such
slashing effect that the Gornelites were utterly paralysed. From this
time Scunner betook himself to out-fighting; but here he took nothing by
the change, except prolonging the fight. At the end of one hour the
Gornel Champion, having been hit down or thrown in five or six successive
rounds, was finally floored in the 31st round, and deaf to the call of time.
Tass Parker, of West Bromwich, and Preston, of Birmingham, seconded
Perry; Surrender Lane and George Gallant, of Birmingham, waited on
Scunner. The match exciting much interest in the Potteries, Perry, with
Parker, became the “lions” of the neighbourhood; the Fountain Inn, at
Tipton, the Slasher’s headquarters, being crowded by the Fancy of the
Midlands at their benefit on the ensuing Monday.</p>

<p>The defeat of Jem Scunner, who had an immense, though undeserved,
local reputation, in a period when the dearth of good big ’uns was remarkable,
spread the fame of the prowess of the Slasher so widely that he was
fain to wield the shovel in laborious obscurity, instead of flourishing his
ponderous mauleys in the 24 foot. In the interval, “the Deaf’un” had
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pageno">160</span>
returned from Yankeeland, and&mdash;&#8203;despite his two successive defeats by
Bendigo (Feb. 12, 1839) and by Nick Ward (Sept. 22, 1840)&mdash;&#8203;owing to
Bendigo’s accident, and Caunt’s announced absence in America, boldly
claimed the Championship. Johnny Broome hereupon sought out the
Slasher, and calling to his aid some patrons of the Rising Sun, he proposed
a “trial by battle,” to settle the difference of opinion. Burke’s backers
came to the scratch with their rhino, for a battle to come off in August, 1842,
but at the fourth deposit Broome thought fit to absent himself upon the
night of “posting the possibles” at Owen Swift’s, and the Slasher’s money
down was confiscated to the extent of £15.</p>

<p>The Tipton, as we know, was a mere tool in this affair, as in other
instances, of the over-cunning Johnny Broome, who, like most self-sufficient
sharps, often “cut before the edge.” Johnny had other views of the
“dark horse” which he flattered himself he had in his own stable, and, as
he didn’t find the money, the poor Tipton suffered in reputation (as Johnny
intended he should do) by this forfeit. The Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, too
honourable himself to suspect this double-dealing, observes: “Though
Broome was certainly late, this insistance on forfeit seems very sharp
practice; the more so as the same gentleman who backs Perry actually
assisted Burke with his first deposit. The forfeit, however, has yet to be
taken by Burke’s backers, as he has nothing to do with it beyond their
approval, and we may yet find that the last and remaining deposits will be
posted, and ‘the ball go on.’ We have since received a letter from the
gentleman who put £4 of the first deposit down on behalf of Burke, when
the match was made, stating that he will not consent to the forfeit being
received, and expressing his desire that the match may proceed, as his only
wish is to encourage the manly sports of the Ring.”</p>

<p>But Johnny was determined to be off with the match, as he had not
found Brassey, of Bradford, so “tenderly led by the nose as asses are,”
and he had now in view a grand <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de poing</span>, to play off against the
unquestionable “blaze of triumph” achieved by Ben Caunt in the circus
and theatre line, by the introduction of what might be called the “illegitimate”
drama in place of, and to the eclipse of, the exhibition of “legitimate”
British boxing. In this fairly-planned vindication of the art from
mere bulky pretenders, Johnny was certainly to be praised; but as his
choice of a champion was “Hobson’s,” and limited to such an inferior tactician
as the game, rough-and-ready Tipton Slasher&mdash;&#8203;to oppose immense
weight, superior length and activity, backed by a creditable reserve of
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pageno">161</span>
courage and self-possession, and moderate skill in sparring&mdash;&#8203;the enterprise
was certainly ill-judged. Of its progress and issue we shall now have to
treat.</p>

<p>In the year 1842, a sensation was created by the return of Ben Caunt
to England, bringing with him a seven-foot specimen of humanity, of the
name of Charles Freeman. There can be little doubt, from subsequent
events, that Ben brought over his gigantic <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span> purely as a showman’s
speculation; and that Freeman, with his immense length, strength, and
bulk, had as little pretensions or inclination to boxing as any non-combative
member of the Peace Society could desire. Ben, however, seeing
how “big things” carried it in Yankeeland&mdash;&#8203;the country of “big things,”
of which he, himself, was certainly one&mdash;&#8203;imported the “American Atlas”
as his sparring opponent; and if he might infer future success from their
first few nights at the Queen’s Theatre, in Liverpool, when not a seat was
to be had in a few minutes from the opening of the doors, the Lancashire
people, at any rate, were willing to patronise the show.</p>

<p>Freeman, during several months, not only exhibited at the Queen’s
Theatre, Lyceum, Olympic, Adelphi, Victoria, and other theatres, halls
and assembly rooms, where a great feature of the entertainments was a
caricature of boxing by the giant and Big Ben, but the non-sporting papers
were flooded with ridiculous paragraphs, several of them offensively setting
forth the wonderful powers and prowess of the American gladiator, and in
some instances asserting the “scare” produced among the English prize-fighters
by the advent of the New World Goliath. We need hardly say
that Freeman himself was entirely innocent of this silly braggadocio,
which emanated from the Barnum managers of these performances, and
the speculators who at this time degraded the character of the decadent
Ring, and prostituted its true aim&mdash;&#8203;the encouragement of courage and
skill&mdash;&#8203;to their own profit and plunder. Johnny Broome, then in the full
tide of his prosperity, called a meeting at his house, the “Rising Sun,”
Air Street, Piccadilly, where, after the reading of some of these “puff
paragraphs” about “Championships of England and the World” (Ben
Caunt modestly claiming the first, and liberally presenting his prodigious
pal with the other), it was proposed to bring these pretensions to a practical
test by a challenge for £100 a side from “a novice,” to be hereafter named
by Broome. On the following week, at the adjourned meeting, Tom Spring
presented himself, on the part of Caunt, and stated the latter to be ready to
make a deposit for Freeman. Spring further said that Freeman had not
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pageno">162</span>
come to this country with any intention to fight; his pursuits were quite
different; he, therefore, had challenged no man (this was so; but many of
his placards contained a challenge to any and every man); nevertheless,
he had determined not to refuse this challenge, and, therefore, his money
was ready. Harry Broome, on the part of his brother Johnny, who was
from home, covered the deposit, and the Thursday evening following was
named for drawing up articles, at the “Castle,” for a further deposit, and
for naming “the novice.” Freeman and Caunt were both present, and the
crowd immense. The giant and his mentor, Ben Caunt, arrived late, owing
to an accident on the rail near Weedon. Broome proposed to defer naming
“the novice;” but this being insisted on, or a forfeit claimed, “William
Perry, of Tipton,” was nominated as the “great unknown,” and the following
articles “signed, sealed, and delivered”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p>“Articles of agreement entered into this 29th of September, 1842, at the
Castle Tavern, Holborn, between Charles Freeman and William Perry
of Tipton. The said Charles Freeman agrees to fight the said William
Perry, a fair stand-up fight, in a four-and-twenty foot roped ring, half
minute time, according to the New Rules, for £100 a side, on Tuesday, the
6th of December, half-way between Tipton and London. In pursuance of
this agreement, £20 a side are now deposited in the hands of the stakeholder;
a second deposit of £10 a side to be made on Thursday, the 6th of
October, at Johnny Broome’s; a third deposit of £10 a side on Thursday,
the 13th of October, at Johnny Walker’s; a fourth deposit of £10 a side
on Thursday, the 20th of October, at Jem Burn’s; a fifth deposit of £10 a
side on Thursday, the 27th of October, at Tom Spring’s; a sixth deposit of
£10 a side on Thursday, the 3rd of November, at Johnny Broome’s; a
seventh deposit of £10 a side on Thursday, the 10th of November, at Tom
Spring’s; an eighth deposit of £10 a side on the 17th of November, also at
Tom Spring’s; and the ninth and last deposit of £10 a side on Thursday,
the 1st of December, at Johnny Broome’s. The said deposits to be made
between the hours of 8 and 10 o’clock, p.m., or the party failing to forfeit
the money down; a toss for choice of ground to take place on the night of
the last deposit. The men to be in the ring between the hours of twelve
and one o’clock, or the man absent to forfeit the whole of the stakes. Two
umpires and a referee to be chosen on the ground, the decision of the latter
in the event of dispute to be conclusive. In case of magisterial interference
the referee, if chosen, to name the next time and place of meeting, or if the
referee be not chosen then the stakeholder to name the next time and place
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pageno">163</span>
if possible on the same day; but the money not to be given up until fairly
won or lost by a fight; the winner to pay for the ropes and stakes. Should
any money be given for the privilege of the fight taking place in any particular
locality, such money, if agreed to be accepted, to be equally divided
between the men.</p>

<p>Offers were made to take two to one on the Yankee, but nothing more
than six to four could be obtained. The match excited extraordinary
interest, and set all the Americans in town on the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</span>. They viewed
the success of Freeman as a result already almost attained.</p>

<p>After a round of “appearances,” “benefits,” “soirées,” “entertainments,”
<abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> to which the well-advertised fact of being “matched” lent
additional attractions, both men went into training, Freeman at Frank
Key’s, the “Duke of York,” Gannick Corner, near Barnet, and the
Slasher in the first place at our friend Jemmy Parsons’s, at Hampton,
and subsequently at Ould Tom Owen’s, at Northfleet, Kent. A
contemporary paper thus announces the coming event on the previous
Saturday:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Freeman has been assiduously attended by his friend Ben Caunt, and
has been ranging up hill and down dale like the celebrated giant Gog, in his
‘seven-league boots,’ with staff in hand and followed by ‘a tail,’ which, from
the length of his fork, generally keeps a respectful distance in his rear.
Although his nob has been roofed with a shallow tile, to diminish the
appearance of his steeple-like proportions, he still has the appearance of a
walking monument, to the no small alarm of the squirrels in Squire Byng’s
park, into whose dormitories he occasionally casts a squint of recognition.
By his good humour and playfulness of disposition he has won all hearts,
and has been a welcome guest on whatever premises he has cast anchor in
his walks, which have seldom been less than twenty or thirty miles a day.
He has been extremely attentive to his training, and has been much
reduced in flesh, while his muscular developments stand forth with additional
symmetry. On his arrival in this country he carried some twenty-three
stone ‘good meat,’ but we doubt whether on Tuesday he will much
exceed eighteen stone. His drawers and fighting shoes have been built
with a due regard to ease and elegance, and the latter have been seasonably
aired by being lent to a cat and kittens as temporary nurseries.
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pageno">164</span>
He already sports his blue bird’s-eye fogle, and, without vaunt or unseemly
bounce, seems to think his chances of success are planted on a good
foundation.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Slasher has been under the care of Johnny Broome, whose brother
is constantly with him, and was removed on Tuesday, for some reason not
explained, from Hampton to Northfleet. We have not seen him, but he
is described as in fine condition, and in high spirits. He will weigh, we
hear, between thirteen and fourteen stone, stands six feet high, and is a
well-proportioned, muscular fellow (always deducting the ‘baker-knee,’
which destroys the perpendicular of his pedestal). His flag of cream colour
ground, with the union-jack in the centre, bearing the words ‘Old England,’
and the rose, the thistle, and the shamrock in the corner, the whole inclosed
in a blue border, has been unfurled at Johnny Broome’s, and has found
numerous supporters on the usual terms, ‘a sovereign or nothing.’ The
betting within the last week has varied; in some places the Slasher has
been taken for choice, in others Freeman has been the favourite at 5 to 4,
at which price a good deal of business has been done. The final deposit
was made at Johnny Broome’s, in Air Street, Piccadilly, on Thursday evening,
in the presence of a goodly muster. Neither of the men was present.
Betting was slack, 5 to 4 only being offered on Freeman; but after some
breathing a ‘supposed green,’ offered 30 to 10 on the Giant, at which
Johnny Broome snapped, as well as 20 to 10 immediately after from the
same innocent, who said he had £50 to lay out and was satisfied with a
small profit. This, however, did not advance Freeman much in the betting,
for, after a good deal of ‘screwing,’ higher odds than 6 to 4, and this
reluctantly, could not be obtained. In consequence of a private agreement
between the backers of both men, the appointed toss for choice of ground
did not take place.”</p>

<p>There had long been a complaint in the Fancy circles of the dearth
of “great men;” if “great” be synonymous with “big,” then this was a
“great fight.” How far it deserved that epithet the reader will shortly be
able to decide. The Slasher had never been credited with scientific qualifications,
and “the American Giant” was remarkable solely for his prodigious
bulk and weight-lifting pretensions, never having fought a prize
battle before. The match, we are inclined to think, arose rather from a
desire to put the pretensions of “the Yankee <em>critter</em>” to the test than from
any belief that a man could be found capable of successfully competing
with such “a mountain of humanity;” the more especially as Ben Caunt,
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pageno">165</span>
the Champion of England, had signified that he and Freeman were sworn
friends, and were, therefore, unlikely to come in hostile collision. Johnny
Broome was consulted as to whether he could find a man willing to try his
hand with the Giant, and he at once answered in the affirmative, experience
having afforded him opportunities of estimating the game and muscular
qualities of the Slasher, who was perfectly willing to make the
experiment. It was under these circumstances the challenge was given
and accepted. This was the position in which matters stood when the
match was made, and in due course the men went into training, each taking
every pains to improve his stamina and physical qualities. We may here
remark that, in the opinion of competent judges, the mere fact of Freeman
being so much taller and heavier than his opponent was not regarded as an
argument in favour of his real superiority. In truth, we have seen, and
over and over again been led to believe, that a man standing six feet high,
and weighing between twelve and thirteen stone, with muscular power and
activity in proportion, is the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau ideal</span> of manly perfection; and that anything
beyond this is mere surplusage, seldom, if ever, of any real advantage,
as has been remarked of most of the giants who have been exhibited
as objects of curiosity. We must admit, however, that for his size, we
never saw a man so symmetrical in all respects as Freeman; there was
nothing unwieldy or awkward in his appearance. In point of muscular
development and strength, too, we are persuaded there was not his equal,
and in point of activity and lightness, and springiness of action, he was not
less to be admired; in fact, his early career was in the equestrian school,
where, among other feats, he rode two horses at once, at the same time
balancing a man with his arms above his head as he galloped round the
circus, added to which he was renowned for the number of somersaults he
could throw in succession. In lifting weights, too, on more occasions than
one, he has raised fifteen cwt. from the ground. With all these appliances,
however, there yet might be a want of animal courage and natural powers
of enduring punishment and fatigue; and in the absence of any criterion
upon which an opinion on these latter points could be formed, considerable
doubts were entertained of the probable issue of his battle with the
Slasher, who was known to possess fearless intrepidity, great bodily
strength, some science, and sufficient height and weight to entitle himself
to be ranked among the most dangerous of our modern millers. Hence
the betting, which seldom exceeded 5 to 4 in favour of Freeman, did not
prove him to have inspired any extraordinary confidence in the minds of
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pageno">166</span>
his friends, of whom, from his really unassuming conduct, civil deportment,
and good temper, he had many.</p>

<p>We may here state that the wisdom of not ascribing too much merit to
superior bulk derived confirmation from scientific calculations made by
Mr. Hutchinson, a surgeon of eminence, who made some curious experiments
by means of hydraulic and other instruments to ascertain the constitutional
powers of human beings, founded on comparisons of the strength
of their lungs, by respiration and inspiration, the state of their pulse, capacity
of chest, height, weight, &amp;c. Mr. Hutchinson submitted both Freeman
and Perry to his tests, and the result of his observation was, that although
Freeman’s admeasurement was extraordinary in every respect, yet, comparatively,
when the dimensions of both men were taken into account, the
balance of bodily power, strength, and endurance was in favour of Perry,
who Mr. Hutchinson considered more calculated to sustain fatigue and
punishment than his gigantic antagonist. Mr. Hutchinson, of course,
admitted that the inference which he thus drew may be defeated by accidental
or other causes; but looking to the mere animal qualities of the
men, such was his conclusion. That his hypothesis was fairly tried cannot
be asserted, for, as will be seen, both men left off, so far as we were capable
of judging from the darkness which prevailed, pretty much on a par,
whether as respects punishment or fatigue.</p>

<p>It will be borne in mind that at the making of the last deposit, the toss
for choice of ground was dispensed with, Spring, on the part of Freeman,
and Broome, on the part of Perry, having determined on the probable
locality. It was felt desirable to preserve the secret as long as possible,
and it was not till Monday that the direction was generally known, when a
trip by the Eastern Counties Railway to the borders of Hertfordshire and
Essex was announced, with an intimation that a simultaneous departure
by the half-past nine o’clock train to Sawbridgeworth (about seven and
twenty miles from London) would suit all purposes, and prevent any unnecessary
bustle at the immediate scene of action. Notwithstanding the
secrecy which had been observed, however, some few “go-carts” with their
motley inmates were seen going down the road the night before, and thus
a hint was given, of which the police took advantage; and hence, being on
the alert, the attendance of a magistrate was obtained, and much trouble
and inconvenience, as the sequel will show, were experienced. In the
interim both men arrived in town at their respective head-quarters,
Freeman at Tom Spring’s, and Perry at Johnny Broome’s, so as to
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pageno">167</span>
be ready for their morning start, and both houses were crowded to
excess.</p>

<p>With the dawn all were in motion, and by eight o’clock the London
terminus of the chosen railway was besieged by visitors. Many of these
brought drags, which were placed upon the trucks, while others trusted to
the “chapter of accidents,” which proved to have a very wide range, for the
means of conveyance. Among the first arrivals were the Tipton Slasher
and his friends, who thus took time by the forelock, so as to be near the
point of rendezvous in due season. This division agreed to alight at
Harlow station, as the train did not pull up at Sawbridgeworth, which was,
however, but two miles further, within convenient toddling distance, and
thither all proceeded. On reaching the fixture a damper was thrown on
the prospects of the travellers. The superintendent of police was found at
his post. He had received orders from London to prevent hostilities, and to
this was added the fact that Mr. Phillips, a Hertfordshire magistrate, was
in readiness to “keep the peace.” In this unpleasant dilemma all waited
till the arrival of the half-past nine o’clock train, in which came Freeman,
Tom Spring, Caunt, and a vast accession of the Fancy. Fortunately there
was a carriage and four horses waiting the arrival of Freeman, and after a
short deliberation it was resolved to move on to Hatfield Heath, about four
miles further, in the county of Essex, and the “office” being given, away
all went in that direction&mdash;&#8203;the great proportion on their ten toes, for conveyances
were out of the question&mdash;&#8203;and the roads being heavy the pilgrimage
was far from agreeable, especially to “the London particulars,” who were
unprepared for such a journey. For this unexpected tax upon their
patience there was no remedy, and on they went till the desired goal was
reached. On the road there were some few mishaps, but still all were
cheered on by hope. The Commissary lost no time in examining the
intended field of battle, which he found swampy, and far from desirable;
but there was no help for it, and he was about to form a ring when a fresh
alarm was given. The Sawbridgeworth police superintendent and Mr.
Phillips, the magistrate, once more presented their ill-omened countenances,
and plainly declared their determination to prevent the fight taking
place either in Essex or Hertfordshire This was a poser. A council of
war was held&mdash;&#8203;suggestions of all sorts were offered, and a great deal of
time was lost. Cambridgeshire, the adjoining county, was deemed too
distant to be reached in time, and more especially by the pedestrians; and at
last it was determined to “try back,” and return towards London; Broxbourne,
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pageno">168</span>
on the borders of Middlesex and Essex, being agreed on as the
point of re-assemblage.</p>

<p>This point settled, a general move took place towards the nearest stations&mdash;&#8203;the
toddlers to Sawbridgeworth, and the charioteers to Bishop Stortford,
there to repack their nags and drags, while the beak and his co-partner,
considering that a move had been made to get out of their bailiwick, also
moved off. On reaching Bishop Stortford a fresh resolution was formed.
“While the cat’s away the mice will play;” so, as the conservators of
propriety were no longer present, it was urged that the ring might be formed
in the place originally intended, half a mile from the Sawbridgeworth station,
not far from the same field in which Turner beat Scroggins, in June,
1817, and scarcely more distant from the scene of Oliver’s conquest over
Shelton, in 1820. No sooner said than done; and, in the absence of those
who had promised to avoid the county of Hertford, at half-past two o’clock
all agreed to drop down to the place from whence they came, with the
exception of the Commissary, Freeman, and his friends, who took the main
road in a carriage kindly yielded to them by the Right <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> the Bishop of
Bond Street, who also hospitably furnished their larders with a very welcome
supply of roast fowls and other “combustibles,” of which their
“inward men” stood beseechingly in need. In the interim the Slasher
threw himself on a bed at Bishop Stortford, and all who had wisdom took
some hasty refreshment. On again reaching Sawbridgeworth we were
informed that the lists were formed, and a competent guide being found,
all set out along the towing-path of the canal to a very eligible site, about
half a mile off, on an elevated piece of ground admirably calculated for the
purpose. The evening was now fast approaching, for it was nearly four
o’clock, and it was hoped there would be still daylight sufficient to decide
which was the better man. The privilege tickets were distributed, and
in a short time everything was arranged for the commencement of
hostilities.</p>

<p>All being in readiness, Freeman entered the ring in high spirits, attended
by Caunt and King Dick, and was received with loud cheers. Rumours
were now afloat that the Slasher did not mean to come, and sovereigns
even were offered to be laid that there would be no fight. In the interim
horsemen were sent off to Sawbridgeworth station to urge the approach of
the missing man, who it was known had been left there in charge of
Broome. Matters thus remained in doubt for some time, and great impatience
began to be manifested, when it was announced, to the great joy of
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pageno">169</span>
the spectators, that the Slasher was coming&mdash;&#8203;and come at last he did,
amidst the encouraging shouts of his friends. He lost no time in entering
the ring, and was immediately met with a friendly shake of the mauley by
Freeman. The Slasher was attended by Ben Terry and a provincial friend
named Tom Parker. No time was now lost in “trimming” the men for
battle, and their superfluous “feathers” were quickly removed. Both
appeared in high spirits and eager for business. Umpires and a referee
having been chosen, the ring was cleared out, and the “privileged” dropped
contentedly on the damp earth, with such preservatives to their sitting
places as circumstances would permit; but it must be acknowledged that
these were far from satisfactory, owing to the difficulties to which the
Commissary had been exposed in the various transfers of his <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">materiel</span>.</p>

<p>On being stripped and placed in juxtaposition, the towering height of
Freeman presented a most formidable aspect, while the muscular development
of every limb, and the broad expanse of his chest and shoulders, gave
him the appearance of herculean strength. His weight, without his clothes,
we understood was but little above seventeen stone, for it was remarked
that during the last week of his training he rather diminished than increased
in bulk. Still, he was in high spirits, and moved about with elastic and
graceful step. In the following July he would be 23 years of age. The Slasher
also wore a cheerful smile on his mug, which betrayed the fact that he had
already lost some of his head rails. From his hips up his bust displayed
great muscular power, but being in-kneed, there was less of symmetry in
his figure than in Freeman’s. On throwing himself into position, however,
this was scarcely perceptible, and he may be described as a model of burly
strength. He appeared to be, and said he was, in excellent condition, and,
judging from his cheerful index, there was no want of self-confidence. His
height six feet, his age twenty-three, and his weight 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>; but notwithstanding
the fearful odds against him, he evidently regarded the coming
struggle with gallant indifference. Of betting there was but little&mdash;&#8203;5
to 3 was offered but not taken, and the only bet we heard laid was one of
6 to 4 on Freeman.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Precisely at seven minutes
after four o’clock the men were conducted
to the scratch, their fogles having been
first tied to the corner stake, and having
shaken hand with great good humour, the
seconds retired to their corners. The towering
height and gigantic proportions of
Freeman led all to suppose that he would
endeavour to fight down his opponent; but,
as will be seen, this anticipation was not
fulfilled. The Slasher stood on the defensive
and Freeman broke ground, hitting
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pageno">170</span>
out with his left; from this the Slasher
retreated, when Freeman followed him
quickly, popped in his left and right slightly,
and the Slasher was down. Freeman laughing,
and no mischief done.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher again to the scratch,
when Freeman led off left and right; the
latter blow got well home, and dropped the
Slasher. <em>First knock-down</em> blow for Freeman;
but no damage done, as the Slasher
received it when retreating.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher made play, and tried his
left on Freeman’s body, but was stopped.
Freeman rushed to him, the Slasher retiring
and hitting short and wild. Freeman popped
in his left and right, caught the Slasher in
his arms, and threw him with ease.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher, on the defensive system,
dodged a little, delivered his left on the ribs,
in getting away he fell, and thus escaped
Freeman’s return.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Freeman hit out left and right, but
the Slasher ducked his head and fell on his
knees.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher on the dodging system,
stepped back; Freeman after him to the
corner, where there was a wild rally, in
which hits right and left were exchanged.
The Slasher got within Freeman’s long
arms, gave him a tidy smack with his right
on the left eye, and got down. (<em>First blood</em>
from Freeman’s brow, and the Tipton lads
uproarious.)</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher, the first to fight, hit out
left and right, but was stopped. Freeman
slashed away left and right but without precision,
and after some trifling deliveries
the Slasher got down.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher popped in his left on
Freeman’s ribs, and got away; Freeman
after him, when the Slasher closed. Freeman
lifted him clean off the ground, but was
unable to get his arm loose to fib, and after
a short struggle the Slasher slipped from his
grasp and got down.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher again led off with his left
at the body, and in getting away fell from
accident or design. [Cries of “foul” and
“foul” was claimed on the part of Freeman;
but the referee did not feel himself
justified in stopping the fight, and “time”
was called.]</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher again tried the artful
dodge, rushed in to hit with the left at the
body; but Freeman seized him in his powerful
feelers, held him up for a short time, and
finding he could do nothing at in-fighting
fell on him, but not so as to do him any mischief.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher as lively as a grig popped
in his left on Freeman’s arm and got away;
Freeman followed, gave him one, two, left
and right The Slasher broke from him,
and delivered his right on his shoulder; then
getting away, fell to avoid.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher once more led off with
his left, but was short. Freeman after him
delivered left and right; the Slasher down.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Freeman popped in his left, The
Slasher retreated and fell.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Freeman again planted his left slightly.
The Slasher adhered to his retiring system.
Freeman followed him to the ropes, and
after a scrambling exchange of hits the
Slasher got down. Freeman pointing at
him derisively with his finger and laughing.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Freeman hit left and right, and the
Slasher rushed in and caught him round the
body, to try for the fall; Freeman held
him up completely off the ground by the
neck, then chopped first with the left and
then with the right; the Slasher hit up left
and right, and caught Freeman on the
mouth with his right; and after a short
struggle was thrown, Freeman on him.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher again tried his left at
the body, but was short, the blow falling
slightly on Freeman’s arm. Exchange of
blows. Freeman with the left on the nob,
and Slasher on the shoulder with the right,
which sounded, but was of no effect.
Slasher, in retreating, fell.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Slasher came up on the defensive,
but Freeman hit him down with his left.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Slasher again popped his left at the
body, but was hit down with a counter-hit
from Freeman’s left. Freeman fell on him,
and foul was claimed by Slasher’s party,
but not acknowledged, as it was obvious
the fall was accidental.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Slasher hit Freeman on the shoulder
with his right, and in return caught it left
and right as he retreated. Slasher returned
to the charge with his right, and fell.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;A wild exchange of blows, but not
effective, and the Slasher slipped down in
retreating.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;[Twenty-three minutes had now
elapsed, no real damage done on either
side, and both as fresh as when they commenced.]
The Slasher popped in his left
on the body, and stepped back; Freeman
after him, hit left and right, and the Slasher
fell.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Freeman delivered left and right;
the Slasher was short in his return, and
again received two pops left and right, and
fell.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Freeman delivered left and right, and
Slasher down.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Freeman led off with his left. The
Slasher popped in his left on the mark and
tried to drop, but Freeman caught him
round the neck and held him up some time,
and then let him fall, tumbling over him.
(Another claim of foul not allowed.)</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Freeman popped in his right on
Slasher’s left eye; the Slasher countered on
his shoulder, when Freeman caught him
with his left, and the Slasher was down.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Freeman again planted his left; and,
on Slasher rushing in, caught him in his
arms, held him for a second or two, and fell
on him.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Freeman popped in his left, and
dropped his man with his right.
</p>
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pageno">171</span>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher hit short with his left,
and renewed the dodging system, playing
round his man. Freeman tried to nail him,
but he got away, hit out with his left at the
body, and fell without a return. [Another
claim of foul for Freeman, not admitted.]</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;Slasher hit at the body with his left
and broke away, Freeman after him, all for
mischief, caught him on the hop, and hit
him down with his right.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher delivered his right on
Freeman’s shoulder, broke away, and tried
it with the left on the body, but was stopped.
Freeman let go left and right, but the
Slasher ducked his nob, escaped, and fell.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher again in with his left on
the ribs and away; Freeman after him,
caught him on the pimple, and he fell.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher hit short left and right,
and was hit down with Freeman’s left.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher pursued his left-handed
game at the body, but, in getting away, was
hit down with a touch from Freeman’s left.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher missed left and right,
caught it left and right, and was down.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;[It now became so dark that it was
difficult to see what was doing in the ring,
and the spectators came closer to the ropes.
The partisans of the Slasher were extremely
uproarious, and one of them especially was
constantly interfering with the umpires,
called “time” when it was not time, and
was guilty of other most offensive and unfair
conduct.] The Slasher, as usual, led off
with his left at the body, but without effect,
and in return was hit down.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher hit short with his left,
and was hit down by a counter from Freeman’s
left as he was getting away.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;Slasher planted his favourite body
blow with the left, but without producing
any visible effect; Freeman did not seem to
feel it, and he was again down.</p>

<p>     38.&mdash;&#8203;Trifling exchanges with the left, and
the Slasher down.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher rushed in to make another
effort for the throw, but Freeman
again seized him in his powerful grasp,
fibbed, and fell with him, but not on him.</p>

<p>     40, 41, 42, 43, 44.&mdash;&#8203;Slasher down in every
round, but apparently no mischief done,
and as far as the glimpse of light left would
permit, we could discover no distinct mark of
punishment on either man.</p>

<p>     45.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher delivered his left at the
body and fell, as if from the force of his own
blow. Freeman fell over him, but evidently
with a desire to avoid falling on him.
[Another appeal was made to the referee
on the ground of the Slasher falling without
a blow, but the referee declared it was impossible
to form a correct opinion, and expressed
a strong wish that the fight should
either be drawn or adjourned, but to this
neither party would accede.]</p>

<p>     46, 47, and 48.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher down in each
round, and Freeman manfully avoiding
falling on him.</p>

<p>     49.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher in with his left on the
body, but as he attempted to retreat Freeman
caught him in his arms, held him for
some time, occasionally chopping, and at
last fell forward on him, but too much over
to produce any consequence.</p>

<p>     50.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher showed some fatigue, but
came up full of confidence. He delivered his
left at the body, but did not get well home;
Freeman caught him left and right, and he
went down to avoid further mementoes.</p>

<p>     To describe the remaining rounds would
be an idle attempt, in fact it became so dark
that the men were only visible from the
light colour of their skins and drawers.
The Slasher pursued his dodging, getting
away, and falling system, occasionally
making his left and right hits at the body
and shoulder, and sometimes appearing to
recoil from the effects of his own blows, but
without producing any turn in his favour.
Freeman hitting left and right, and now
and then seizing his man, lifting him up,
and flinging him down, but almost invariably
avoiding falling on him; in one instance
actually making an arch over his carcase,
his head and legs on the ground, amidst the
acclamations of the throng. In the last
few rounds there was an evident attempt to
draw Freeman into the Slasher’s corner,
round which a desperate set of ruffians had
collected, who, by the most offensive vociferations,
endeavoured to intimidate and
alarm him. He, however, kept his temper,
and came up every round cool and collected,
grumbling only at the Slasher not standing
up to fight. In the 69th round the Slasher
exclaimed, “I’ve got you now, old fellow!”
but the words were scarcely out of his
mouth when Freeman hit him down with
his left. The darkness, combined with a
fog, now became so intense that it was impossible
to see what was doing from one
side of the ring to the other. The referee
declared his utter inability to form any
judgment of the character of the fight, and,
unable to get both umpires to agree on the
expediency of putting an end to the battle,
he jumped into the ring, and, getting
between the men, declared he would
not permit them to prolong the contest. At
this moment both men were fresh and
vigorous, and each seemed disinclined to
leave his chance of victory in doubt, Slasher
especially, who said he considered he was
robbed of the fight, while Freeman laughed,
and said, if they were permitted to proceed,
the result would perhaps prove he was
mistaken. The referee was, however,
peremptory, and both men were taken from
the ring after having fought <em>seventy rounds</em>
in <em>one hour and twenty-four minutes</em>. They
walked away as fresh as when they began,
with a mutual desire that they might renew
the combat the next day at twelve o’clock,
at such place as the referee might appoint,
to which the latter assented, as there did
not appear to be anything in their appearance
to justify a further delay in the gratification
of their desires.
</p>
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pageno">172</span>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;It is much to be regretted
that this curious encounter was not brought
to a more satisfactory conclusion, inasmuch
as the merits of the men still remain undecided;
and so evenly had their pretensions
been balanced in the minds of their respective
friends that each party declares, had
time and circumstances permitted, their
favourite must have been crowned with
victory. How far these conclusions may be
well or ill founded we will not pretend to
say; but certainly we feel justified in giving
to both men an equal proportion of praise,
so far at least as their game qualities are
concerned. It is true, we may be disposed
to take exception to the “getting down”
system which was adopted by the Slasher,
but then it must be borne in mind he fought
at fearful odds both as regards weight and
length, and could never hope successfully
to compete with such an antagonist unless
by a degree of caution and cunning, which
with a man of his own inches would have
been unjustifiable and amounted to cowardice.
There is no doubt that occasionally his
dropping after delivering his blows had too
much the appearance of being at variance
with our notion of “a fair stand-up fight;”
but then the ground was slippery, and he
asserts that when he did fall it was from the
recoil of his own blows or from his being
unable to keep his feet in endeavouring to
avoid the tremendous return which he had
sufficient reason to expect. That this was
provoking to Freeman we can well imagine;
but, under all the circumstances, we do not
think it detracts from the game qualities of
the Slasher, who certainly came up from
first to last undismayed, and with a manly
determination to win if he could. Of his
scientific qualifications we cannot say much.
If he possessed any they were reserved for
a future occasion. He never attempted to
stop the blows which were showered on his
canister, and throughout confined himself
to attempts to disable Freeman by body
blows from his left or round hits with his
right. The former occasionally reached
their destination with sounding effect, but
we are inclined to believe they fell more
frequently on Freeman’s arm, which was
dropped to catch them, than upon his more
vulnerable corpus. That some of them
might have got home we are inclined to
believe, but it was clear they did not produce
any serious consequence, for on examining
the Giant’s body subsequently we were
surprised to find so few symptoms of forcible
collision on his ribs, while we discovered
sundry bruises on his fore and upper arm,
which showed these had been exposed to heavy
visitations, and no doubt stopped numerous
kind intentions which, had they reached
their destination, would have been far from
agreeable. With the right the Slasher was
unsuccessful, as it generally fell on Freeman’s
left shoulder, and with the exception
of the cut on the left eye, which gained first
blood in the sixth round, this weapon did
not produce much damage, for the only
other punishment visible was a slight scratch
and swelling on the under lip, which was
produced by the upper cut in the fifteenth
round. In his attempts to throw, the
Slasher had not the most remote chance of
success, for when the attempt was made
Freeman lifted him completely off the
ground and threw him as he pleased, occasionally
going down with him, from overbalancing
himself. Throughout the fight it
struck us that the Slasher showed no
symptoms of distress, except after the struggle
in which he was suspended between
heaven and earth for some time in Freeman’s
grasp, and was then thrown, Freeman
falling on him. With respect to Freeman,
although a novice in the milling arena, it
must be admitted that throughout he showed
great coolness and presence of mind. He
never lost his temper, and was only indignant
that the Slasher would not stand up to
receive his sledge-hammer compliments. It
struck us, however, that with immense
power he wanted judgment in its application.
His left and right hits were straight
and well directed, but he failed in countering
with his left, for had he let fly at the same
moment that the Slasher tried his left at the
body, the consequences would no doubt
have been serious. He too frequently
suffered the Slasher to lead off and get away,
so that in following, his blows did not tell
with half the effect. Of this there was
sufficient evidence in the little impression
he made, there being no material damage
discernible on the Slasher’s countenance
beyond a slight cut on his left brow, and a
few contusions which afterwards produced
discolouration&mdash;&#8203;a black eye included. We
learn also that he received sundry raps on
the head and neck, out of sight, which required
the aid of leeches to allay inflammation.
His left hand, too, was a good deal
puffed. Freeman’s left thumb was also
injured, and from the force of one blow was
actually put out of joint; but the dislocation
was reduced, and little harm arose from
this. There is no doubt that many felt
astonished, after witnessing so many apparently
heavy deliveries followed by instant
prostration, that more decisive consequences
were not produced. It must be borne in
mind, however, that Freeman hit against a
yielding object, which of course offered
little resistance, and fell from the slightest
concussion. Had the Slasher hit with him,
or stood firmly on his legs, the effect would
have been different; and many of his hits
were rather shoves or pokes, instead of
coming well from the shoulder. The tumbling
system of the Slasher cannot be pursued
with impunity, and if it be clearly
shown that he falls without a blow, there
will be less hesitation in condemning him to
defeat, as he must now perfectly understand
the distinction between accident and design.</p>

<p>The sports thus most unsatisfactorily concluded, and the excitement
which prevailed having subsided, those of the throng who remained to the
last&mdash;&#8203;for a great number had already taken their departure&mdash;&#8203;began to speculate
on the best mode of getting home. So intense was the darkness that
it was almost impossible to distinguish your best friend, although close at
your elbow; and the calls for Bill, Tom, and Harry resounded in all directions,
with unsatisfactory responses of “Here; where are you?” and so
forth. Then came inquiries as to the best mode of reaching the station.
Some by guess, who thought they had marked the road they came, ventured
to set out on their journey, and were soon heard floundering in the ditches
or swamps into which they had wandered, and roaring lustily for relief.
Others employed the yokels as guides, and thus they went, in connected
chains, pursuing their devious paths. The Bishop of Bond Street, who had
magnanimously resigned his carriage to Freeman, was foremost among the
unfortunates, and went floundering on through mud and mire, but cheerfully
submitting to all manner of casualties, till he reached the Sawbridgeworth
station, where he was joined by hundreds of others, some of whom
had got into the canal, others into dreary swamps, and all more or less
miserable, but still happy in having escaped the perils to which they had
been exposed. Complaints were loud and numerous; and verily some of
our friends presented piteous specimens of human misery, with pretty certain
prospects of future suffering from colds and other ills to which flesh
is heir. A great number got off by the six o’clock train, but many had to
remain for that which followed, and did not reach their destination till a
late hour. There were but few carriages on the battle-field, and these
were with difficulty piloted to the main road, and by that route either to
the Harlow station or to the Metropolis. The Slasher with difficulty
reached Sawbridgeworth, where he obtained requisite refreshment; and
Freeman, equally fortunate, got to the Harlow station, and in a room of
one of the attendants found “a good Samaritan,” who attended to all his
wants. He was in good spirits, and but little the worse for wear. Caunt
and Spring paid him every attention. The numerous assemblage here,
half famished, had to send half a mile for the means of satisfying their
appetites, and bread, cheese, and beer were in anxious requisition; to
these a lucky contribution of a Yorkshire ham and sundry chickens, from
the hamper of a swell drag, proved a most acceptable addition for a party
of “the select.”</p>

<p>Before the departure of the train, the Slasher, accompanied by Johnny
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pageno">174</span>
Broome, arrived at the station, and the proposed renewal of the battle on
the ensuing day, at twelve o’clock, was discussed. Broome foresaw the
difficulty in which he would be placed to afford due information of the
whereabouts to some of the Slasher’s backers who had gone to London,
and who were more desirous than ever of witnessing the termination of
the contest. At his request, to which Spring did not object, it was settled
that a meeting should take place the next day at four o’clock, at the house
of the referee, to arrange this important point. The Slasher was unusually
bounceable, and asked Spring if he was disposed to add a hundred to the
stakes. A reply in the affirmative was instantly given, but the challenge
evaporated, and nothing more was done. The arrival of the up-train put
an end to discussion. All were soon embarked, and away they were
whisked to Shoreditch. Freeman arrived at the “Castle” about half-past
nine, where an immense crowd greeted his return; and the Slasher, in the
same way, could scarcely obtain ingress to the domicile of Johnny Broome
of which he is, just now, the “Rising Sun.”</p>

<p>The next day Spring attended, at the time appointed, at the place of
rendezvous, but Broome did not make his appearance till an hour after.
In the interim, with a view to give each man sufficient time to resuscitate
his energies, the referee appointed the following Thursday, between twelve
and one o’clock, for the renewal of the combat; the “whereabouts” to be
communicated to the backers of each in time to enable them to reach their
destination without inconvenience. On the next morning both men went
back to their training quarters to prepare for the coming struggle. An
earlier day could not have been named without interfering with the
arrangements for the mill between Maley and M’Grath, which was fixed
for the ensuing Tuesday between London and Manchester.</p>

<p>On Wednesday evening Freeman left London in company with Caunt,
Spring, and his trainer, and put up at “The Bull” at Royston, his movements
being kept a profound secret. Broome, for some reason, would not
take his man to Royston, but preferred travelling, with a few friends only,
by an early Eastern Counties train to Bishop Stortford, and thence
posting to Littlebury, Essex, the appointed place for meeting, though it was
privately arranged that Cambridgeshire should be the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus in quo</span> the affair
was to be finished off. That quietness, and therefore secrecy, was pretty
well observed, we may note that on Wednesday night there were only eight
strangers in Royston, and five only in Littlebury, including Dick Curtis.
The Commissary, and his assistant, Broome, having given the “office” for
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pageno">175</span>
Bishop Stortford, a goodly number of the London division came down by
later trains, and the demand for drags, post-horses, or indeed anything on
wheels or four legs, became astonishing. Broome, Slasher, and party arrived
at Littlebury in a carriage with four posters in more than good time.</p>

<p>Meantime, Freeman and his friends remained quietly at Royston, and
it was not until Thursday morning that the Commissary received a despatch,
directing him to have the ring formed, before twelve o’clock, at Triplow
Heath, Cambridgeshire, on the spot where Bungaree and Sambo Sutton
last fought&mdash;&#8203;eight miles from Littlebury and three from Royston&mdash;&#8203;where,
it was added, Freeman would be present at that hour. Word of these
arrangements was to be sent to Broome. All this was strictly attended to,
and the ring was accordingly formed without interruption. Thus all
looked well; but just before twelve o’clock, up rode Mr. Metcalf, a
neighbouring magistrate, who by “some chance” had got “a letter,” and
who, quitting his “toast and ale,” thought it wise to interfere. He at once
said the fight must not take place on that spot, and a courier was sent forward
to apprise Freeman of the ominous interruption. Freeman had come
in sight of the ring at the moment, and a general halt took place, a small
cavalcade having been formed by a few of the right sort, who had posted by
way of Ware and Buntingford to Royston, and a respectable troop of mounted
yeomen. A consultation immediately took place, and Haydon Grange, within
two miles of the spot, in the neighbouring county of Essex, over which
Mr. Metcalf was said to have no jurisdiction, was selected. Thither the
materiel was quickly transferred by the Commissary and his assistants, and
by one o’clock all was again “in apple-pie order” on the top of a hill, and
on a spot particularly eligible for the purpose. Care was taken to provide
for the due direction of the Littlebury divison, and a gentleman provided
with Spring’s stop-watch kindly remained on Triplow Heath to note the
time of the Slasher’s arrival, to prevent any mistake as to the road he was
to take. This gentleman remained till after one o’clock, but no Slasher
appeared, although all those who had come by the same train trotted
briskly forward to the new location. Other scouts were left, but it was
nearly two o’clock before any tidings were heard of the absentee. The
ring being perfect, all were impatiently deploring the loss of time, during
which the fight might have been commenced, continued, and perhaps concluded.
During this unfortunate lapse offers were again made to take 2 to
1 there would be “no fight,” and some who had passed Broome on the road
reported that he had declared he did not intend to be in the ring till two
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pageno">176</span>
o’clock. Spring claimed forfeit, on the plea that the Slasher was not at
the place first appointed between twelve and one, according to articles; but
the referee refused to admit this claim, on the ground that the ropes and
stakes had been removed, and Freeman had not thrown his castor within
them. Had it been otherwise he would have had no hesitation in agreeing
that the claim would have been well founded. At last the agreeable intelligence
was received that Broome had arrived, and he entered the ring out
of breath, asserting that he had been detained for the want of post-horses, but
that he was at Triplow Heath at seven minutes before one&mdash;&#8203;a statement
which the gentleman who remained on the Heath to meet him positively
denied. He then said that he had only been told the place of fighting on
the morning before. Still the Slasher did not appear; and two o’clock
having arrived, Spring said he would only give five minutes more, and
should then consider Freeman was entitled to the money if the Slasher
did not arrive. Within the time specified Slasher was brought slowly to
the field of battle, having, according to Broome’s account, taken from
seven minutes to one to five minutes after two to come very little more
than two miles. Cheerfulness succeeded wrangling, and all looked well
for the gratification of the throng, who had come far and near to witness
the battle. Umpires were chosen, privilege tickets distributed, the ring
effectually cleared out, and Freeman threw his tile into the arena&mdash;&#8203;an
example which all anticipated the Slasher was about to follow&mdash;&#8203;when to the
dismay of everybody, in marched Captain Robinson, the superintendent
of police, who had ridden a steeplechase across the country, attended
by an orderly. This authority emphatically announced that he had warrants
for the apprehension of both men, and would not permit the peace
to be broken, adding it was not wise to attempt such amusements
in a county in which the character of the new police for vigilance was
at stake; but worse than all, to secure obedience to his behest, he called upon
Tom Spring and Tom Oliver, in the name of her most gracious Majesty, to
assist him in the discharge of his duty! This was indeed a settler; and to
watch the physiognomies of the two Toms on finding themselves thus
suddenly metamorphosed into constables would have given food for speculation
to the most astute student of Lavater. “Blow my dickey!” exclaimed
the Commissary, “so I’m to act as a special, am I?” “This
bangs Bannagher!” said Spring, looking as black with his right eye as if
he had knocked it against Caunt’s fist. Parley, however, was out of the
question, for Captain Robinson said his own reputation as well as his appointment
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pageno">177</span>
were at stake. A belief existing that Captain Robinson would be
content with preserving the peace of his own county, Essex, a resolution
was formed to try Cambridgeshire once more. “Bock agin, Sandy,” was
the cry; and away went the pioneers of the Ring through the lower part
of Royston, on the road towards Bedfordshire, where fresh ground was
sought. But a new beak was started from his lair on the road, in the form
of a Royston banker, who peremptorily said it should be “no go.” Some
disposition arose to question this gentleman’s authority in Cambridgeshire;
but all argument was at an end on the arrival of Captain Robinson with
his assistants. He plainly told the assemblage that it was in vain for them
to attempt getting the fight off in Hertfordshire, Essex, Cambridgeshire,
or Bedfordshire, for he was empowered to act in all, and must stick by them
till night if they remained. This was conclusive. “To the right about,”
was the word, and away all returned to Royston. There was some talk of
stopping all night, to fight the first thing in the morning, to which the
Slasher said he was agreeable; but a gentle whisper having been given
that if the belligerents stopped longer in that neighbourhood the warrants
might be enforced against them, a general retreat was ordered, and away
the Cockney division scampered&mdash;&#8203;Broome, with the Slasher, back to
Chesterford, from whence they had had their last relay of horses&mdash;&#8203;and
Spring, Freeman, and friends, by Buntingford to London. All were too
late for the trains, and thus many remained on the road all night, while
others did not reach “the village” till a late hour. Again were hundreds
collected in front of Spring and Broome’s houses to know the result,
among whom conflicting accounts were afloat till the authentic courier
arrived and diffused fresh dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>The chances, changes, and fortunes of this incongruous match were thus
sung in some contemporary verses, of sufficient merit to warrant their
preservation.</p>

<p>The referee having been called on to name the next time and place, the
parties interested met at his house the next day (Friday). The Slasher
was present, and expressed an anxious desire to have the fight over; he
declared he had no wish to evade the meeting, and was quite ready to
fight the following day (Saturday). To this Spring replied that as the Commissary
had not yet returned to London with the ropes and stakes, and as
his whereabouts might not be known in time, the proposal would not be
accepted. The Tipton objected to a long delay, and as Bungaree the
Australian and M’Ginty were to fight on the following Tuesday, it was
suggested that both couples should be “asked out” at the same place and
time. It was then found that the backers of Bungaree and his opponent
had selected a locality where it would be most imprudent for such noticeable
men as the Giant and Slasher to show themselves without certainty of
interruption. The Bungaree division, however, proposed to alter their
plans and effect an amalgamation, by jointly hiring two steamboats for the
conveyance of the men and their friends to the field of battle&mdash;&#8203;that the
vessels should leave London Bridge on the Tuesday morning at eight
o’clock, and proceeding down the river, pick up the “big’uns” at places
appointed; and that, with the view of securing the absence of undesirable
voyagers, two sets of tickets of contrasted colours should be issued by
Spring and Broome only, no person to be admitted on board except those
presenting the one for the downward the other the homeward voyage.</p>

<p>On the next day, Saturday, Freeman took a benefit, previously announced,
at the Westminster Road Baths, the immense area of the
“Mechanics’ Bath” being crowded to excess. That these affairs, of which
there was too much at this period, were profitable speculations may be
gathered from the fact that exclusive of free admission and tickets sold
elsewhere, £178 was taken at the doors, although the performers were the
humbler outsiders of the Ring, with the exception of Freeman (who showed,
but did not set to, in view of the impending contest) and Caunt, whom Tom
Spring kindly assisted by putting on the gloves with him. Although Big
Ben showed some improvement, his style, as compared with the accomplished
ex-champion of a long bygone day, could not fail to awaken unpleasant
comparisons in the minds of such men as Mr. John Jackson, old Tom
Cribb, and Thomas Belcher, all of whom were recognised at this gathering
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pageno">180</span>
Freeman, who stripped, had not a bruise upon his body, and except a little
swelling of the lip and an injury of the right thumb, bore no marks of the
recent encounter.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, December 20th, 1842, at 8 a.m., we embarked on board the
“Father Thames” steamer at the Old Swan Pier, London Bridge, Freeman
having been put on board from a row-boat half an hour previously,
while the vessel lay in midstream, and privately ensconced in the after-cabin,
his immense stature being rightly considered as placing him in
great peril of arrest if exposed to the public gaze. At Blackwall the
Slasher came on board, looking rough and hardy in the sou’wester and blue
frieze of a river pilot. The other combatant couple, M’Ginty the Scotchman,
and Bungaree the Australian, had quietly embarked at London
Bridge. The company on board, about four hundred in number, was truly
representative of the Ring patrons of the day. A Scotch marquis, two or
three scions of the peerage, a sprinkling of military men, a veteran “salt,”
sundry hunting and university men, doctors, barristers, with some sporting
clubbists from “the sweet shady side of Pall Mall” and the dingy smoking
snuggery of the now resplendent “Limmer’s,” formed the “upper-crust.”
The Church, of course, was not represented, unless we may enumerate the
Right <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> the Bishop of Bond Street in that category. That facetious
worthy was indeed prominent, and, with the forethought gained by long
experience, had brought on board a capacious hamper, accompanied by a
handsome basket of white willow, which, to the delight of the Corinthians,
who formed “the excursionists” thus “personally conducted,” disclosed at
an after period a wealth of game-pie, pigeon-pie, chickens, ham, tongue,
salad, and the various comestibles for which Fortnum and Mason are
renowned. That the white willow basket was a worthy auxiliary of the
big hamper “goes without saying.” “Schnapps,” in several square-shouldered
and short-necked bottles and flasks, cognac, sherry, and a battalion
of silver and gold-necked champagne, came forth at intervals in such
succession as made us think that the Bishop had really the supernatural
gift boasted by Glendower, “I can call spirits from the vasty deep,” and
that “they do come when I do call them.” But we are anticipating. The
“old familiar faces” of Ned Painter, from Norwich, Tom Spring, Peter
Crawley, Oliver, and Burn were on deck, together with Adams, Johnny
Walker, Langham, Orme, Parker, Johnny Broome and his brother Harry,
Tom Maley, Jemmy Shaw, <abbr title="et cetera, et cetera">&amp;c., &amp;c.</abbr>; while the “sporting publican” division
was represented by Owen Swift, Jem Cross, Jack Gardiner, Jemmy
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pageno">181</span>
Moore, “Stunning” Joe Banks, and a host of “hosts.” On her downward
course the “Father Thames” was followed by several craft, and by the
time she arrived at the Lower Hope Point, about six miles below Gravesend,
there was quite a “mosquito fleet” in sight, not including a “tail” of Gravesend
wherries which were permitted to hang on to her stern tow-rope.</p>

<p>When off Cliffe Marshes, the welcome sounds of “Ease her!” “Stop
her!” “Easy astarn!” sounded from the bridge. All on deck were in a
bustle of delight. The facetious Joe Banks, backed up by jolly Jem Burn,
having, with impressive gravity, informed a group of listeners, the destination
of the craft being as yet a secret, “that the swells below had arranged
with the captain for a trip to the coast of France, as they were determined
to have no more stoppages from beaks nor blues,” the horrid rumour
ran from stem to stern; and not a few were sorely exercised in their minds
as to how a limited knowledge of the French language, and a slender
exchequer, would serve them in a trip to the Continent, much more bring
them back again, should they miss the boat. Great, then, was the laughter
at those who were beginning to believe in “the sell” when the paddles
were backed, the chain-cable run out, and the smartest of the boatmen
hooked their craft on to ropes hanging from the sponsons of the “Father
Thames.” The ground was well chosen, under the lee of a high ridge of
the river bank, in a level intersected by broad ditches, and approachable
only by crossing a deep drain, bridged by a couple of stout scaffold planks,
at each end of which was a cluster of ring-constables, who secured comparative
safety to the single file of pilgrims, many of whom carried
folding-seats from the steamer, forms, trestles, bundles of straw, baskets,
and other conveniences, to say nothing of two enterprising Israelitish speculators,
who, with dubious steps, staggered over the wooden bridge, amid
the cheers and laughter of the admiring crowd, carrying a beer-barrel
slung on a slight, springy pole. This bridge of Al Sirat passed, and “the
land of promise” reached, the cheerful groups assembled round the outer
rope, while the privilege-ticket holders, press-men, and officials, seated
themselves on the stools aforesaid, or, with the best waterproof protection
procurable, assumed recumbent positions on the damp and springy morass.
The outer circle was soon after materially increased by a crowd of East
Enders, conveyed by sundry steam-tugs, which, at a very low tariff, conveyed
the multitude to the Kentish <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>.</p>

<p>And now the doughty champions hove in sight from a hovel where they
had been ensconced. The American Ajax had for his armour-bearer Ben
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">182</span>
Caunt, and for his page King Dick, who certainly, in this instance, carried
in his little noddle the larger portion of the scientific knowledge of the trio.
The Slasher loomed large, enveloped in a long white frieze coat, his
head surmounted by an Indian fur cap, with a ferocious wild-cat mask as
a vizor, which he wore upon his forehead over his own hard, grinning
physiognomy. Ben Terry and Harry Broome were his henchmen. On
stripping it was evident that Freeman had increased in bulk by a stone
and a half&mdash;&#8203;18 stone 12 lbs. being the result told by the weighing-chair
that morning. His confidence, too, seemed to have increased in a corresponding
degree. The Slasher, on stripping, looked thinner, and certainly
paler than when he last peeled in Cambridgeshire; but he had lost none
of that careless, “dare-devil” expression for which his countenance is
remarkable. A Scotch sportsman, and backer of M’Ginty, having accepted
the onerous and difficult position of referee, the first battle was brought to
the arbitrament of attack and defence.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;At thirteen minutes after twelve
precisely the men were conducted to the
scratch, shook hands, and threw themselves
into position, the towering height and great
bulk of Freeman presenting the same fearful
odds we have before described. The
Slasher dodged round his man, waiting for
an opening, but he found the Giant ready to
hit with him, and he had already felt the
weight of his feelers with sufficient force to
have the prudence of keeping at a distance.
The Slasher tried his left and right, but was
out of distance. The Giant followed him in
his <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pirouettes</span>, and at last, getting closer, hit
out left and right; the former passed over
the Slasher’s head, but the latter caught him
slightly on the nut, and the Slasher went
down.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher again cautious and <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la
distance</span>. Freeman followed his dodging
manœuvres, and at last rushed in to hit, but
the Slasher in getting away fell without
being struck, and got up laughing.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher got near to his man and
let out with his left at the nob, but did not
get home. Trifling exchanges with the left,
the Slasher retreating, Freeman at him left
and right, just reaching him, when the
Slasher tumbled down. No mischief done.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;After renewed dodging the Slasher
made himself up for mischief, feinted once
or twice, and then hit out with his left.
This brought the men to a rally, in which
favours were exchanged, and the Slasher
catching it on the nozzle showed first blood.
After some wild fighting, in which hits
were exchanged, the Slasher was down.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Slasher cautious and getting away
from the Giant; he at last steadied himself,
and counter-hits with the left were exchanged.
The Giant followed up his man to
the corner, but missed both left and right,
and Slasher got down.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Counter-hits with the left, but no
sting in them. The Giant hit out well with
his right, but the Slasher dodged and got
away. The Slasher was short with his left
and right, and again got away. He returned
to the charge, and caught Freeman slightly
on the body with his left. Freeman returned
the compliment on the temple, but it was
more of a shove than a blow. Slasher hit
short with his left, ducked, and got away
laughing. The Giant steadied himself,
waited for the attack, stopped the Slasher’s
left, and caught him a stinger on the left ear
with his right. The Slasher scrambled
down in a sort of rally.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher planted his right on the
Giant’s shoulder, and got away; the Giant
after him, and after exchanging left and
right out of distance, the Slasher got down.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Pretty exchanges left and right, and
flesh marks left. The Slasher tried at the
body with his left, stooped, and got away.
The Giant pursued him, hitting wildly left
and right. He at last caught the Tipton in his
arms and chopped him on his head several
times with his right, but without administering
any serious punishment. The Slasher
slipped down to avoid further hitting.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher tried his left, was short,
and got away. The Giant followed him as
he dodged round the ring, but his blows did
not reach their destination. After a wild
scrambling rally the Slasher got down.
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">183</span>
There was a want of precision in Freeman’s
deliveries which forbade the hope of execution.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher dropped a heavy smack
on the Giant’s ivories with his left, which,
coming in contact with his teeth, inflicted a
wound on his own finger, that bled profusely.
He tried it again, but was short, as was the
Giant in his attempt to return, and the
Slasher fell on his knees.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;The Giant’s mouth showed the effect
of the blow in the last round, his lips were
swollen a little, and a tinge of blood was
perceptible. The Slasher led off left and
right; the former on the ribs, and the latter
on the shoulder, and rushing in after a
struggle, went down on his knees.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher came up laughing, the
Giant looking serious; counter-hits with
the left. The Slasher dodged, and retreated
towards the ropes; the Giant followed him
impetuously, and missed his one two. The
Slasher dropped, looked up, and laughed.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher hit open handed, and
retreated; he then tried to drop his left on
the Giant’s dial, but his hand went over his
shoulder; he then retreated, but finding the
Giant rushing in for mischief, he dropped.
[Cries of “foul,” but the umpires did not
interfere.]</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher got home with his left,
and dropped on the Giant’s jaw. The Giant
returned the compliment on the cheek and
ear, right and left, when the Slasher went
down. It scarcely could be called a knock-down
blow.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher led off, and popped his
left on the Giant’s mouth. The Giant after
him, and caught him heavily with his right
on the ear, which became seriously swollen.
A rally, in which there were some heavy
hits exchanged, and in the close the Slasher
got down.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher, as usual, commenced
hitting out left and right, but did no execution,
his blows being wide of their mark.
Freeman to him left and right, but the
deliveries were not effective. The Slasher
down.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Freeman popped a heavy smack with
his right on the Slasher’s neck. The Slasher,
stung, rushed in wildly. The Giant steadied
himself, hit out well with his left, and
the Slasher dropped.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher made play left and right,
was short, and went down. His second
was observed rubbing his neck, and there
was a little of the <em>doldrum</em> appearance in
his phis.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher hit short and only reached
Freeman’s shoulder with his right. He then
fought on the retreat to the corner, where
he got down.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher showed symptoms of
blowing. He led off in his old wild way,
evidently afraid of the return, and on the
Giant lunging out right and left, he went
down anyhow.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Slasher short with his left, and
caught it heavily from the Giant’s right on
the ear; trifling exchanges, and the Slasher
down.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher again short in his deliveries.
The Giant nailed him left and right,
but not with much severity, then seized him
in his arms and flung him down, walking
contemptuously to his corner.</p>

<p>     23, 24, 25, and 26.&mdash;&#8203;Scrambling work, and
Slasher down in every round.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;The injury to the Slasher’s left hand
appeared to increase, but in this and the two
following rounds no mischief was done, and
he invariably dropped grinning.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;A wild blundering round, in which
there was no precision on either side&mdash;&#8203;the
Slasher slipped down, but was up again and
renewed the round. After a scrambling
rally, the Slasher again got down, and
slipped completely under the Giant’s fork,
at whom he looked up and grinned.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher hit short left and right,
and threw himself down with a whop to
avoid. Freeman laughed and shook his
head, seeming to consider that it was intended
to induce him to strike foul.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher succeeded in planting a
right-handed chopper on the Giant’s pimple,
and got away. The Giant dashed after him,
hitting left and right, and then endeavoured
to seize him, but the Slasher slipped away
and fell.</p>

<p>     31, 32, 33, and 34.&mdash;&#8203;The fighting wild and
indecisive; in the last round, the Giant hit
the Slasher down; but it struck us as rather
a push than a blow.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;The Giant in left and right&mdash;&#8203;the
Slasher retreated&mdash;&#8203;the Giant after him, but
it was no go&mdash;&#8203;he let fly right and left, and
then went down. The ground now became
extremely slippery for both men.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;Freeman led off, but was short and
wild, and did not reach his man. Slasher
popped in his right on the Giant’s shoulder,
and in getting away went down.</p>

<p>     37 and last.&mdash;&#8203;Freeman ready, when the
Slasher rushed to close quarters, struck him
on the shoulder with his right, but, on the
Giant attempting to return, he went down
without a blow.</p>

<p>     A call was made by the seconds of Freeman
on the umpires, who disagreed, and on
appealing to the referee he pronounced
“foul;” and, no doubt, had a similar
appeal been made to him before, he would
have given a like decision.</p>

<p>     The Giant was immediately proclaimed
the winner, and was taken out of the ring
after fighting thirty-nine minutes.</p>

<p>     The Slasher came up again “fresh as
paint,” and evidently but little injured by
the contest. His left ear alone showed
serious marks of punishment; it was much
swollen and filled with coagulated blood.
The finger of his left hand was likewise cut;
but the contusions on his index were few
and of trifling consequence. He seemed
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pageno">184</span>
anxious to renew the contest, and denied
that he had fallen purposely. The judgment
had been pronounced, however, and there
was no recalling it.</p>

<p>     Johnny Broome was evidently mortified,
and offered to put down a score for the
Slasher to fight Ben Caunt, “then and
there.” Spring said such a proposition
savoured too much of passion and folly, but
said Caunt was prepared to fight the Slasher
or any man in England for from £100 to
£500, and the money was always ready at
his house.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;This was altogether an unsatisfactory
contest. The match was unequal,
and the difference in the size of the
men, Freeman having already shown no lack
of personal bravery, left no room for speculation
on the issue. Everybody foresaw that
the Giant must be triumphant, notwithstanding
he fought badly. In fact he did
not hit at points, and missed most of his
well-intentioned but ill-directed blows from
the shifty character of his opponent, as well
as from his own wild and uncertain mode of
delivery. He hits round with his right, as
the Slasher’s ear testified, and his left-handed
deliveries are more like pokes than
punishing hits. That he is a game man we
have no doubt, but he is unwieldy, and
possesses too much of “the milk of human
kindness” ever to become a “star” in the
Ring, even if his equal could be found. We
are inclined to think, however, that this
will have been his last appearance in the
<abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, and should recommend him to choose
some more suitable occupation&mdash;&#8203;although as
a sparrer, from his great size, he will always
be an object of curiosity. The Slasher is a
mere rough, who must be beaten by a well-scienced
man. That he would have shown
to more advantage with a man of his own
pretensions and size we have no doubt; but
with Freeman he felt he could not hope to
win, and therefore became reckless and careless&mdash;&#8203;seeking
only how to escape those visitations
which, had he made a “fair stand-up
fight,” must have ended in more serious
punishment. As it was, both escaped with
comparatively trifling injuries, and remained
to witness the subsequent fight. The contusions
on the Slasher’s ear were reduced by
a surgeon who was on board the steamer,
and after a little ablution he was himself
again, repeating that his going down without
a blow was the effect of accident, and
not of design&mdash;&#8203;an assertion the truth of
which few who saw the performance were
disposed to admit.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>The ring being cleared, and M’Ginty, the Scotchman, having defeated
Bungaree (John Gorrick), the Australian, after a game battle of one hour
and forty-seven minutes, the voyagers possessed of “return tickets” re-embarked
on “Father Thames;” <ins title="oi pollos">οι πολλος</ins> betaking themselves to their
tugs, row-boats, and ten toes, as necessity might compel. Although it was
dark ere the boat passed Blackwall, all were safely landed by seven p.m. at
“Old Swan,” highly gratified with the good order preserved by the ring-constables,
and the perfect arrangements of the managers for this great
day’s “outing.”</p>

<p>As a compliment and a help to Dick Curtis, who, on the Tuesday,
assiduously seconded both the Giant and Bungaree, his benefit was fixed
for the following Thursday, at the Westminster Baths, which were crowded
to excess by all classes, from the Corinthian to the costermonger. The
crowd assembled was scarcely less numerous than at the Giant’s benefit,
and the spirit in favour of boxing certainly more apparent. We were gratified
to recognise Mr. Jackson, Tom Cribb, Tom Belcher, Tom Spring, Jem
Burn, and most of the old originals. Freeman, the Slasher, and Bungaree
showed, but M’Ginty was <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">non inventus</span>. Freeman and the Slasher
scarcely displayed a scratch; but Bungaree showed a few marks of <em>chasing</em>
and hammering on the mug, and his left hand was in a sling, the sinews
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">185</span>
of the knuckle having been divided. The setting-to was excellent and
abundant, and included a long list of talented exhibitors. Among others,
Johnny Broome and Johnny Hannan displayed great vigour and determination,
and, after a matchless exhibition of talent, it would be difficult to
say which “bore the bell.” Their exertions were rewarded by thunders of
applause. Freeman and Caunt also elicited the warmest approbation, the
Giant sparring with a freedom and ease that surprised many who were disinclined
to believe in his improvement. The appearance of Tom Spring
with the veteran Tom Belcher&mdash;&#8203;who made his first appearance after a
retirement of fourteen years from the sparring-schools&mdash;&#8203;produced an enthusiastic
sensation, and the set-to between these men afforded the greatest
satisfaction. Belcher, by the beauty of his position, and quickness and
neatness of his stops and hits, reminded us of what were indeed the palmy
days of the Ring. Spring had the advantage in length and bulk of frame;
still, the display was, upon the whole, a finished specimen of the science of
self-defence. King Dick and Owen Swift, the retired champions of the
light weights, wound up the sports, and were most favourably received.</p>

<p>Johnny Broome then mounted the stage, and announced that the Slasher
would take a benefit in the same popular arena on Monday, January 2, at
which Freeman and Caunt had kindly promised again to appear; and, by
way of opening the New Tear, the Slasher would then be prepared to make
a match with Caunt, at 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, for £100 a side. [This proposition had
been previously made to Caunt, but he had declined.]</p>

<p>Tom Spring immediately mounted the stage, and said Johnny Broome
well knew his challenge would not be accepted, as it was impossible for
Caunt to reduce himself to the weight proposed. Caunt was ready to fight
Slasher or any man in England, from £100 to £500, “catch weight;” but
he (Tom Spring) knew too well the consequence of men reducing themselves
below the natural standard to sanction such a proceeding. For
himself, he could only say that he never fought 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, and never barred
weight, country, or colour, for he was satisfied 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> was weight enough for
anything living who meant fighting. He had stated Caunt’s terms, and if
Slasher did not choose to accept them, there was no harm done.</p>

<p>Broome said he would not have made the proposition had not the Slasher
told him that Caunt himself made the offer.</p>

<p>Thus ended this sensational burlesque on boxing. On the ensuing
Tuesday the “Castle” was crowded to excess, on the occasion of the
giving up of the stakes to the undoubted winner. Freeman, the Slasher,
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pageno">186</span>
Caunt, Johnny Broome, Bungaree, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum multis aliis</span>, were present. The
Stakeholder, in rendering his due to the victor, observed that he should
refrain from offering any comments on the character of the fight, but at the
same time give Freeman every credit for his unassuming conduct since his
arrival in this country, as well as for his strict observance in the ring of
those principles of fair play which formed the groundwork of the rules of
British boxing. He had never offered a challenge, but being challenged he
could not with honour decline the invitation, but at the same time he
entered the arena without the most remote hostility towards his opponent.
He had come to this country on a friendly speculation in conjunction with
Caunt, and he (the Stakeholder) believed the match had been made on the
part of the Slasher rather to try the value of the weight of metal which
Freeman carried when placed in competition with the old English breed,
than from any anticipation that so small a craft could compete successfully
with a vessel of such magnitude. The issue had shown that “the Giant”
was too much for “the pigmy,” but as the experiment had been fairly
tried, there was no ground for censure on either side. After some further
remarks on the necessity of union among professional boxers themselves, a
strict adherence to honesty and fair play, and a due sense of the necessity
of propriety in their general demeanour, he handed the “flimsies” to
Freeman.</p>

<p>Freeman immediately rose, and dusting the cobwebs from the ceiling
with his “thatch,” expressed his deep sense of the kind and hospitable
manner in which he had been received in this country. He confessed he
touched English ground with different anticipations, but he was glad of the
opportunity of acknowledging that in England neither country nor colour
made any difference, and that all were alike sure of fair play. He came
in company with Caunt rather to see England than for any other purpose,
and being a little in the “glove fancy,” he thought he might bring it to
account to pay expenses. He never entertained the idea of fighting, but
being challenged, in justice to the United States, of which he was a native,
he felt that he could not do less than stand by his flag when its character
for courage was at stake. He should have great pride when he returned to
Yankeeland in expressing his grateful feelings for the favours he had
received, which were those rather to be expected by a brother than a stranger.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_19" id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span>

</p>
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pageno">187</span>

<p>An appeal was then made for the losing man, and a few pounds were
realised, for which the Slasher returned thanks by giving his pimple an
extra pull forwards.</p>

<p>“The British and American Flags,” with an ardent hope that they
might never be unfurled but as the tokens of peace and union, was drunk
with enthusiasm, and this was followed by the healths of Tom Cribb, Tom
Spring, and Ben Caunt, the two past and present champions of England;
to which was added the health of Johnny Broome, who denied that the imputations
cast upon him of a disinclination to bring his man to “the scratch”
had any foundation. He said he was already £115 out of pocket by the
match, but that he believed the gentleman who had proposed the match
would not suffer him to be the loser.</p>

<p>The year 1842 ended, and 1843 opened for the Slasher with a round of
“benefits” in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Dublin, &amp;c.,
organised and engineered by the clever Johnny Broome, who showed his
“golden belt” and intimated the immediate readiness of the Slasher to
meet Caunt on “fair” terms, which, however, were, when they came to
particulars, far from being “fair” in Big Ben’s estimation. A match with
Wm. Renwick, of Liverpool, to fight for £50 on the 22nd of August, 1843,
near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, ended in a severe disappointment, Renwick
being arrested on the previous Saturday at his training quarters, when the
whole of the stakes were down.</p>

<p>Perry lost no time in advertising his readiness for another customer,
barring neither weight, country, nor colour, and Tass Parker, of West
Bromwich, answered his cartel. Tass had just carried his fame to the
summit by his defeat of Brassey of Bradford, after a game and scientific
battle of 158 rounds, occupying two hours and fifty minutes, in August,
1841, and subsequently receiving £70 forfeit from Bendigo in June, 1842;
the Nottingham champion being arrested at his brother’s instance, which
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pageno">188</span>
the suspicious did not fail to attribute to Bendy “not fancying the job,”
which was not the truth. Broome, who certainly was “nuts” on this
match, went straight ahead, and Tass’s backers were equally fond, so that
on Dec. 17th, the fight being fixed for Tuesday, Dec. 19th, 1843, we find
the coming battle thus announced in <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On Wednesday evening the ‘Rising Sun,’ in Air Street, was crowded
to an overflow by patrons of the milling school, anxious to witness the
completion of the stakes for the match between these men, which was duly
accomplished according to articles. It was mutually agreed by the friends
of both to ‘sport a toe on the water,’ according to modern usage, and the
‘Nymph’ Woolwich steamer has been chartered for the occasion. She
will leave her moorings off Hungerford Market on Tuesday morning precisely
at eight o’clock, drop down to London Bridge, and from thence ruffle
the stream to Blackwall Pier, from whence she will make her final plunge
towards the Nore, and we heartily wish her a pleasant and prosperous
voyage. Tickets are on sale at Owen Swift’s, Johnny Broome’s, and Tom
Spring’s, and we recommend an early application, as the number will necessarily
be limited. Tass Parker has arrived in town, looking so ‘full of
bloom’ that he has been backed at 6 to 4, and even 2 to 1. He certainly
is quite up to the mark, and books winning as a point already gained. The
Tipton Slasher has been finishing his training at Stockbridge, under the
watchful eye of Levi Eckersley, who pronounces him right well, and fit for
the battle-field. We had heard that the Slasher had hurt his right arm in
setting-to with Harry Broome, at Bristol; but of this we have no personal
knowledge, and learn that the blemish has been completely removed. Were
it otherwise, we should scarcely anticipate that Johnny Broome, who says
he has had to find almost all the money, would have gone on with the
match, and he certainly speaks with great confidence. Parker has been
visible at Owen Swift’s every evening since Wednesday, and the Tipton
Slasher will be at Johnny Broome’s, Air Street, Piccadilly, to-morrow
evening. That Parker is a most accomplished fighter none will doubt, but
against this comes the rough and ready tact of the Slasher, who combines
courage with superior weight. All we can hope is, that we shall have a
fair and manly contest, and that the best man may win.”</p>

<p>How little these expectations were realised, and these good wishes
availed in the event, may be read in the tale we shall now briefly deliver;
for we consider that a detailed account of the shifty and contemptible
farce performed by Parker, which occupied more than two columns of
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pageno">189</span>
small print in <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> of December 24, 1843, would be mere waste of
space in a work like the present. This is more especially the case when
we find that the second and adjourned fight (which we shall give) was as
wearisomely similar in character and incidents to the first.</p>

<p>Suffice it, then, to say, that the voyage per steamer was safely carried
out, and that the attendance of amateurs and professionals was immense,
notwithstanding the severity of the weather and the dreary and inhospitable
character of the Dartford Marshes, whereon the ring was pitched.
Peter Crawley having consented to preside as referee, the performance began.
In the opening rounds Parker displayed his superior skill, both in getting
on to his man and getting away; but the Tipton had certainly greatly
improved under the skilful mentorship of the Broomes, and was no longer
the mere hardy rough which many yet considered him. He every now
and then waited for, timed, and neatly stopped his clever and crafty assailant,
inflicting severe punishment with his right upon Parker, who, finding
he could not get near enough to deliver without exposing himself to heavy
returns, soon began to fight shy. Indeed, round after round, after getting
in a blow, Parker resorted to the reprehensible dropping system, not only
to avoid hitting, but also to provoke and irritate his less skilful adversary
and thus tempt him to deliver a foul blow, or, at the worst, to bring the
fight to a “tie,” “draw,” or “wrangle.” In this way sixty-seven rounds
were fought, with no prospect of an approach to the decision of the battle.
At this period&mdash;&#8203;one hour and thirty-four minutes having been consumed&mdash;&#8203;the
Kentish constabulary made their appearance, and stopped the tedious
exhibition. The company, of necessity, re-embarked, and the disappointed
excursionists returned to the Metropolis.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the men and their backers, at Peter Crawley’s (the
referee’s), to arrange when and how their interrupted encounter should be
concluded, Johnny Broome, on the part of the Tipton, asked a postponement
for three months, and produced the following medical certificate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="flushright">
“194, Blackfriars Road. Dec. 25, 1843.</p>

<p>“This certifies that we reduced a fracture of the fore-arm of William Perry on or about
the 7th of November, and a fracture of the lower jaw on the evening of the 19th of December.
These serious injuries will require a period of at least three months before he can be in a
situation to fight again.</p>

<p class="flushright">“CHARLES AND JOHN BRADY, Surgeons.”</p>
</div><!--end certificate-->

<p>Parker, after some protestation against so long a delay, was met by
Broome consenting to name that day ten weeks for the renewal of hostilities.
Parker insisting on eight weeks, Broome consented to “split the
difference,” and, finally, that day nine weeks was agreed upon.
</p>
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pageno">190</span>

<p>The adjourned battle was fixed for Tuesday, the 27th of February, 1844.
Peter Crawley, who had been referee on the first occasion, declaring he
had no further interest in the affair, left it to the parties themselves to
settle their future proceedings. This was done by Jem Parker (Tass’s
brother), on the part of his Birmingham backers, and Johnny Broome, on
behalf of the Slasher. It was decided to engage a special train on the
Brighton line (an experiment which had proved successful on some recent
occasions). The tickets, at 10s. 6d. each, were secured under the guise of
“an excursion;” the departure and return being arranged with the manager,
so as not to interfere with the order and regularity of the traffic at the
London Bridge terminus.</p>

<p>In consequence of the damage received by both men in their previous
encounter, they were early sent into training, Tass Parker at Finchley,
the Slasher near Tring, and, in point of condition, no two men could have
been brought into better trim.</p>

<p>The time appointed for departure was nine o’clock, and before that hour
the terminus-platform was crowded by persons of all classes, among whom
we distinguished many members of the “upper ten thousand,” some of
whom had travelled long distances to be witness of what they hoped would
be a fair and manly mill. All were soon seated, and at a few minutes to
ten the iron-horse puffed and panted his way out of the station, and
after a single draw-up of a few minutes at Croydon, for the passing of a
down train, disembarked its living freight at Horley (about twenty-five
miles from London) at a little before eleven.</p>

<p>The excursionists, immediately on alighting, repaired to the “King’s Arms”
inn, and about half a mile thence, across Horley Common, the Commissary
obtained the use of a field, high and dry, and screened by a dense belt
of evergreen trees from the view of travellers by road or by the Brighton
line. The weather was delightful; but although there had been a sharp
frost during the night, the genial influence of the sun had produced an
unwelcome change in the roads and paths leading to the field of action,
and as all had to find their way to the “fixture” upon their ten toes,
the quagmire through which they had to wade, however agreeable it might
be in softness to their corns, was anything but favourable to the polish on
their trotter-cases, or pleasant to those who happened not to have the good
fortune to be well shod. These little difficulties having been got over, the
greatest good-humour prevailed, and all waited anxiously for the appearance
of the men.
</p>
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pageno">191</span>

<p>With a view to prevent the inconvenience of the slippery state of the
sward, a quantity of sawdust was obtained, which was liberally spread at
the corners chosen by the men for their resting places. For the accommodation
of the members of the inner ring there was an ample supply of
stools, benches, and trusses of straw; while a few waggons, after the fashion
of times gone by, afforded comfortable standing-places for those who preferred
the outer circle. The new plan of one person disposing of the tickets
of privilege was on this occasion adopted by Tom Spring, who undertook
subsequently to distribute the proceeds amongst those men who assisted in
preserving order. The plan proved most effective, and it is but justice to
state that all those who paid for the privilege of the inner ring were most
pleasantly located, and were enabled to sit comfortably without the usual
incursion of the “Vandals,” a result productive of the highest satisfaction.
That the partisans of the men occasionally indulged in chaff we will not
deny; but this, however unseemly, did not lead to any encroachment upon
general good order, and in this respect the expressions of approval were
general. Spring, Caunt, Crawley, Jem Burn, the Greeks (old and young),
Barney Aaron, Young Reid, Bill Jones, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum multis aliis</span>, assisted in this
desirable plan, and kept the disorderlies in control.</p>

<p>Shortly before one o’clock, everything being in readiness, the men were
brought to the field, Tass Parker attended by Fuller and Tom Reidie, and
the Slasher by Bob Castles and a Nottingham amateur. The former sported
a flag of blue, with a white spot, and the latter a stone colour, with a pink
spot. On entering the ring, they shook hands with apparent good humour,
and each retired to his corner to prepare. Then came the important question,
the selection of umpires and a referee. With respect to the former
no difficulty was felt, and an amateur for the Slasher, and Jack Hannan
for Parker, were named. The choice of a referee, however, was not so
easily adjusted, and nearly an hour was wasted in discussing the merits of
various persons named by both parties, each on his own especial behalf
objecting to those offered by his opponent. On the part of Parker it seemed
to be determined to have only one of four persons, and to five or six named
by the Slasher, some of whom were persons of the highest respectability, a
decided objection was made. In this way time progressively, but unprofitably,
advanced, and the greatest impatience was displayed. At length
Johnny Broome, on behalf of the Slasher, said he was willing that each
should select a referee, and that those two persons should decide by toss
which was to act, but this met with as firm an opposition as anything by
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pageno">192</span>
which it had been preceded. Johnny Broome then offered to adopt any
gentleman who might be selected from the surrounding crowd, unknown to
either party, but to this there was again a negative response, and still more
time was lost, while the patience of the throng was put to the severest test
from their inactivity and the chilling blast to which they were exposed.
All this time the men remained wrapped in blankets at their respective
corners. The Slasher now rose from his bottle-holder’s knee, and approaching
Parker, offered to fight without a referee, the fight to be protracted
until one or other gave in, but still the obstinacy of Parker’s friends was
not to be overcome. Finally, after the expiration of an hour at least, the
stakeholder, who was present, stepped into the arena, urged on by the
repeated expressions of discontent from the surrounding multitude, and
having recapitulated the various propositions which had been made, declared
that, unless Tass Parker and his friends thought proper to agree either to
toss for choice of referee or to fight without one, he should feel it his duty
to give up the stakes to that man who was willing to abide by one or other
of these propositions. The backer of Tass Parker, finding that he had no
alternative, at last agreed that the men should fight without a referee; a
resolution for which the subsequent conduct of his principal throughout the
fight afforded a sufficient reason, for had any fair and honest referee been in
office, there is no doubt that he must have lost the fight over and over again.
The interference of the stakeholder was hailed with universal approbation,
and the men forthwith proceeded to peel for action, while the “All out!”
of the Commissary and the ring-keepers sent the stragglers to their
posts.</p>

<p>The umpires having taken their seat close together, provided with a
time-telling chronometer, and all being removed from the immediate
vicinity of the ring&mdash;&#8203;with the exception of one individual to take charge of
the water, and other refreshments of each combatant&mdash;&#8203;Johnny Broome for
the Slasher, and Parker’s namesake for his <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protége</span> (a most wholesome
arrangement under the New Rules) business commenced.</p>

<p>Nothing but the force of habit could have made us write the words “The
Fight” at the head of the extraordinary and disgraceful parody on a stand-up
battle which we are now about to describe. It is, however, only
proper to premise that the Slasher must be entirely exonerated from any
personal share in this discreditable libel on the already falling <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, and
therefore “to put the saddle on the right horse,” we proceed to our
account of
</p>
<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pageno">193</span>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;The men came up with their
hands in good position, and after manœuvring
for a short time Parker let fly his left, which
was cleverly stopped. This led to a rally, in
which very trifling hits were exchanged left
and right, but as they were out of distance
no harm was done, with the exception of a
slight discolouration on the Slasher’s right
cheek. Parker, in getting away from the
Slasher’s rush, fell on one knee.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Parker again advanced bold as brass,
looking all over confident, while the Slasher
was not less prepared for action. After a
few dodges, advancing and retreating,
Parker popped in his left on the Slasher’s
cheek. The Slasher fought wildly left and
right, missing some of his hits, but planting
his right heavily on the ribs under Parker’s
left arm. Wild exchanges, when, as Parker
was slipping on his knees, the Slasher caught
his head under his arm, held it as if in a vice,
and hung on him till he fell tumbling on him.
The exchanges were trifling in their consequences,
and a little flush on the skin was
the only indication of punishment.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Parker came up obviously undismayed
by the result of the last struggle, and
apparently resolved to do his best. He tried
his left, which the Slasher neatly threw
aside with his right. The Slasher then advanced,
hitting left and right wildly, and
Parker stepping back to avoid execution.
Trifling exchanges with the left. Parker
again away, and watching for an opening to
advance; dodging left and right, but no
hitting. Parker stole a march, popped his
left in slightly on the Slasher’s mouth, and
broke away, the Slasher wildly after him,
hitting left and right, but Parker slipped
down on his knees and evaded receiving,
thus commencing his old system. On the
Slasher being picked up, blood was visible
from his domino case, and this event was
declared in favour of Parker.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Parker again prepared to lead off,
advancing and retreating, finding the Slasher
ready to hit or stop. At last he hit out with
his left, which the Slasher stopped, and
then rushing in left and right he administered
a trifling upper cut with the latter.
Parker retired to his corner, the Slasher after
him. Parker, in ducking to avoid, slipped on
his knees, but was up again in an instant and
popped in his left. The Slasher hit out left
and right without precision, and after a
wild, scrambling rally, without mischief,
Parker slipped down.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Slasher first up to the scratch, waiting
for the attack. Parker dodged with his left
once or twice, but not within distance. At
length he got closer to his man, popped in
his left on the Slasher’s jaw, who countered
slightly with the left, rushing after Parker,
who retreated to the corner, where he slipped
down to avoid, the Slasher dropping on his
knees beside him.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Both ready, but Parker afraid to approach
his man. The Slasher hit out left
and right, but was out of distance, and
Parker broke away. Parker again dodging
for an opening, and on getting close up to
the work, left-handed counters were exchanged,
but the impressions were trifling.
A wild rally, in which the Slasher got a slap
on the mug, and Parker a heavy hit on the
ribs from the Slasher’s right. A scrambling
exchange of hits left and right, when Parker
slipped down. The hitting was wild, and
anything but effective.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher’s mug somewhat flushed,
but anything but serious in its aspect. Parker
feinted with his left and popped in a pretty
crack with his right on the Slasher’s jaw,
and then broke away. Dodging, but no hitting.
The Slasher hit out left and right, but
was short; Parker retreated to his corner;
wild but ineffective exchanges left and right,
and Parker dropped on his knees.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Both at the scratch at the call of time.
Parker tried his left, but was stopped; advancing
and retreating. Parker endeavoured
to steal a march, but was unable to get home,
and the Slasher retired laughing. Parker
again advanced, while the Slasher retreated;
neither would go near enough to get to work.
At last they got to a wild rally, missing
their hits, and Parker retreating. Having
reached Parker’s corner, the Slasher weaved
left and right, but did not plant his intended
compliments. Parker slipped down, the
Slasher upon him. Parker’s right was puffed
from the effect of one of his flying nobbers.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Offers, but no blows. The Slasher
tried his right at Parker’s nob, but was beautifully
stopped, and Parker broke away.
Parker advanced ready to hit with his left,
when the Slasher rushed wildly to him,
weaving left and right, catching Parker on
the left ear with the latter. In the scramble
which followed Parker slipped down, the
Slasher upon him.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Parker’s ear flushed, and his nose
following suit in a slight degree. Parker advanced,
but retreated the next moment, and
the Slasher went to him. On getting to his
corner there were slight exchanges with the
left; the Slasher hit over Parker’s head with
his right, and Parker dropped.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Parker slow to the scratch, and on
the Slasher advancing he retreated to the
ropes. A wild exchange of hits with the left,
when Parker again slipped down on his
knees.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;No mischief done as yet, although
Parker’s flesh under the arm indicated the
visitations to which it had been subject.
Attempts left and right, in which both missed
their blows. Parker broke away, slipped on
one knee, but jumped up again. Wild exchanges,
Slasher trying his left and right.
Parker, ducking to avoid the Slasher, retreated,
but again rushed to the charge, weaving
<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pageno">194</span>
left and right, ultimately slipping on his
knees, amidst the cries of “cur.”</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;No sooner at the scratch than the
Slasher advanced; Parker immediately retreated
to the ropes, the Slasher after him;
the Slasher hit out right and left, but Tass
ducked under his arm, and escaped the intended
compliments. Parker dropped on
one knee, but again sprang up and caught
the Slasher on the cheek with his left.
Slasher missed his left and right, and Parker
fell.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Parker fought on the retreat: a wild
scrambling rally to the corner, and the
Slasher slipped down.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Parker advanced and retreated, the
Slasher after him, to his corner. Wild
attempts at hitting left and right on the
part of the Slasher, but he was out of distance,
and missed. The Slasher then bored
Parker down on the ropes, himself falling
over outside the ring.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Still no indications of serious mischief.
The Slasher desirous of going to work,
Parker retreating. The Slasher weaving left
and right; an exchange of hits with the
latter, and the Slasher again popped in his
right on Parker’s ear, from whence blood
was visible. The Slasher closed, forced
Parker down on his knees, and fell on him.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Parker on the retreat to his corner,
the Slasher after him. Exchanges with the
left and right, Parker getting prettily home
with the former. A wild rally, both missing
their blows, when Parker dropped.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Slasher the first to the scratch, and full
of fight; Parker retreated to his corner, the
Slasher after him. Slasher hit out left and
right, but without precision. Parker, on his
guard, went down without attempting to
hit.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher, as usual, the first to
obey the call of time. Parker tried his left,
but was cleverly stopped. The Slasher then
rattled to him; Parker evidently ready to
drop, when the Slasher slipped and fell.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Parker hugging his corner, when the
Slasher rattled to him, but missed; wild hits
left and right. Parker popped in his left
and broke away. Slasher again to the
charge, followed his man, caught him a
heavy whack with his right on the jaw, from
the effects of which Parker staggered and
fell. The first knock-down blow for the
Slasher.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Tass’s left stopped, and the Slasher
rushed in wildly left and right. In the exchanges
the Slasher had it on the mouth,
but again planted his right on his shifty
opponent’s pimple, when he got down.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher the favourite, and offers
to back him at evens. The Slasher first on
his pins. Parker retreated, the Tipton
after him, hitting wildly left and right, when
Parker dropped, but jumped up, hit out with
his left, caught the Slasher slightly, and
again fell, amid exclamations of disgust.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Parker slow from his corner, the
Slasher to him, when, after wild exchanges
left and right, with no execution, Tass
went down.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Parker came up evidently a dastard in
spirit, and upon the Slasher rushing to him
he slipped down, amidst the cries of “cur!”
and “coward!” Blood was now flowing
freely from the knuckle of Parker’s left
hand, which had in some of the previous
rounds come in contact with the Slasher’s
tooth. From this to the thirtieth round
Parker pursued the same cowardly game of
making a show as if he intended to fight,
but the moment the Slasher went to him to
hit left and right purposely dropping, and
thereby avoiding the mischief which might be
effected. The Slasher was greatly incensed,
turned round as if appealing to the spectators,
who shouted “cur!” and “coward!”
with stentorian voices. The Slasher’s umpire
repeatedly cried “foul,” and nothing
could have been more decidedly opposed to
every rule of fair play; but Hannan,
Parker’s umpire, did not respond. He was
silent, but it was not difficult to discover
which way his feelings inclined. In the
thirtieth round Parker, after retreating to
his corner, endeavoured to get down to avoid
one of the Slasher’s wild rushes. The
Slasher endeavoured to hold him up, but in
vain; down he went, and the Slasher
dropped on him with his knees. Parker’s
backer immediately claimed “foul”
amidst the derision of all around him. It
would be an insult to the understandings of
our readers if we were to pursue our description
of the 102 imaginary rounds which
followed, during which Parker went down
fifty times at least, the Slasher most forbearingly
avoiding all temptations to strike
or even to fall on him so as to afford pretence
for a claim of “foul.” More than once Tass
threw up his feet so as almost to kick at his
man as he rolled or scrambled over him, after
missing his one, two. It was in vain that the
Slasher essayed to nail him left and right. He
ducked and tumbled whenever there was the
slightest chance of sustaining a hit, inducing
universal marks of disgust at his cowardice,
and the words “cur” and “coward” resounding
from all quarters.</p>

<p>     In the fifty-seventh round the Slasher was
lucky enough to afford him another excuse
for a fall, by giving him a home slap from
the left on the mouth, and laying him prostrate,
while he pointed at him with derision.
The real motive for refusing to agree to the
appointment of an impartial referee now
admitted of no doubt. It had been foreseen
that such a man would have long before
this settled the point at issue by declaring
the battle won over and over again by the
Slasher. But even the absence of such a
character did not serve the intended purpose.
Hannan, who acted as umpire, declared his
situation to be of a most unenviable description.
He looked appealingly to all around
him, and, satisfied that the conduct of
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pageno">195</span>
Parker was at variance with every principle
of honour and fair play, he repeatedly sent
to warn him that if he persisted in the same
atrocious cowardice he must agree with the
repeated claims of his co-umpire, who in
vain called for his honest and impartial
judgment. The poor fellow actually
trembled with vexation at the shouts of
derision which were directed towards his
man, and at length, in the 126th round, on
Parker going down without the most remote
shadow of a blow, unless the wind of the
Slasher’s fist could deserve that character,
he involuntarily exclaimed, in conjunction
with his co-partner, and in accordance with
the universal exclamations from every
quarter of the ring, “foul!” This conduct
on the part of Hannan elicited loud approbation,
but in a moment he was surrounded
by a knot of the most outrageous partisans of
Parker, who threatened instant annihilation
if he dared to repeat his just opinion.
It was in vain we looked for the honest
co-operation of the real members of
the Ring to drive these ruffians from the
arena&mdash;&#8203;they ruled the roost with unblushing
impudence, and treated those who cried
shame on their conduct with insolence and
contempt. At last a second appeal was
made to Hannan, but he was dumb, and
nothing but a renewal of the fight would
satisfy his assailants, and renewed the disgraceful
scene was, but with a perfect anticipation
of what must be the ultimate result.
Many gentlemen, old and sincere
patrons of fair boxing matches, retired from
the discreditable exhibition. The backer
of Tass Parker asserted that he was so
weak as to be incapable of keeping his
legs, while every person who had the
power of exercising the commonest judgment
saw that when he thought proper
he could stand as firmly on his pins
as when he commenced. He had not,
in fact, received a blow which could
have, in the slightest degree, impaired his
vigour, and were his heart in the right place,
he was just as capable of continuing operations
as at the commencement of the fight.
Hannan having resumed his seat, but pale
as ashes, and shaking like an aspen leaf, the
farce was renewed, and for seven rounds
more Parker got up but to fall in the same
dastardly manner which had marked his
career. In the 133rd round he made a show
of fighting, and exchanges left and right
took place. Parker then retreated towards
the ropes, the Slasher after him. When the
Slasher was about to commence his wild and
indecisive deliveries left and right, Parker,
finding he could not get away, for the last
time dropped without a blow, and the shouts
of “cur” and “coward” were renewed with
additional indignation. This was too much
for Hannan, and incapable longer of stultifying
himself and the Ring, of which he
had been, and is, a gallant member, he at
once agreed with the umpire on the other
side that Parker had fallen without a blow,
and had thereby lost the fight. Thus ended
this libel on the “manly sports of the Ring.”
The roughs were taken by surprise, and were
incapable of stemming the torrent of general
indignation; but the weak and powerless
Parker, in order to justify the false opinion
expressed by his backer, jumped up with the
vigour of a lion, and rushing to the corner
where Johnny Broome stood, having possessed
himself of the colours which had been
tied round the stakes, tore his own colours
from his hand, thereby proving that weakness
was the least excuse which could be
offered for his poltroonery. Everybody except
the partisans of Parker was rejoiced at
the termination of this most contemptible
display, and heartily concurred in the propriety
of Hannan’s conduct.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>The battle, if it may be so called, admits of but few remarks. The
Slasher fought with a wildness and want of precision which enabled Parker
to protract the struggle almost indefinitely; for had he been lucky enough
to give him one or two stingers, his heart, which was not bigger than a
pea, would have forced him at once to shut up; but by his contemptible
shifting and dropping he escaped the visitation, and thus owed the confirmation
of his defeat to his own pusillanimity. It is stated that the injury
to Parker’s right hand early in the fight had disabled that limb, and that
he acted under an impression that as there was no referee he had a right
to protract the battle by any device, till one or other was incapable of
obeying the call of time&mdash;&#8203;that is to say, that every principle which renders
boxing praiseworthy should be abandoned, and its worse enemies gratified.
In other words, that he might exercise a treacherous strike and drop from
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">196</span>
the return. Such an argument would not be recognised by the veriest tyro
in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> The Slasher, also, complained of his right arm being injured,
from having come in contact with Parker’s nob early in the contest, but he
certainly brought it into use notwithstanding this injury.</p>

<p>All being over, the crowd returned to the train, stopping at the “King’s
Arms” to partake of such refreshment as that hostelrie afforded, which,
from long privation, became most acceptable. Parker went through the
farce of going to bed, but soon afterwards joined his co-travellers in the
train, and all were quickly wafted to the London Bridge terminus once
more, from whence they took their departure to their respective quarters.
The Slasher scarcely bore a mark of punishment, and on arriving at Johnny
Broome’s was hailed with general acclamations. Some of Parker’s friends
expressing doubts of his qualities, he announced that he was ready to
make a fresh match for £200 a side with his opponent.</p>

<p>On the following Wednesday the stakeholder, notwithstanding a notice
of action from Parker’s backers, gave up the stakes (£200) to Johnny
Broome, under a guarantee, and of course all bets went with the battle-money.
We shall pass over the cloud of correspondence, challenges, and
counter-challenges which ensued, to come to the renewed match, which,
after innumerable delays, was finally made in the early months of 1846.</p>

<p>On the 4th of August, 1846, Parker for the third and last time entered
the ring with “the Tipton,” assuring his somewhat sceptical friends that
he had “screwed his courage to the sticking place” and determined to do
or die. As the Slasher was now viewed by many as the “coming champion”
the final contest between him and his scientific but soft-hearted opponent
will be read with interest.</p>

<p>Lindrick Common, Nottinghamshire, eight miles from Sheffield, was the
scene of action, the ropes and stakes being furnished by the Manchester
Commissary. The attendance of the “upper crust” was by no means
numerous, but there was a tidy sprinkling of Yorkshire sportsmen of the
north-country Fancy, and a perfect crowd of swarthy miners and pitmen
from the neighbouring districts as far as Chesterfield and Derby. An
excellent ring was formed, and, as the writer can testify, a degree of order
observed which might well shame the “roughs” nearer home. At half-past
eleven o’clock the men entered the ring, Reid, of Sheffield, and Nobby
Clarke waiting on the Slasher, Jem Parker and Cottrell, of Birmingham,
seconding Tass. The betting was tolerably brisk at five to four on Parker,
whose friends seemed to be in the ascendant, and certainly better “breeched”
<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pageno">197</span>
than those from “the Potteries.” After nearly an hour’s delay, owing to
objections to several parties named as referee&mdash;&#8203;the representative of <cite>Bell’s
Life</cite> positively declining&mdash;&#8203;Squire Edison accepted the office amidst
acclamations, and the men faced each other for</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;The attitude of Parker, his
left well up in a line with his left foot, and
his right fore-arm slightly bent, and below
the level of his left elbow, was graceful and
attractive; he stood firm, yet springy, poised
lightly on his forward foot, and was equally
prepared for advance or retreat. His condition
appeared first-rate, and his weight,
11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, seemed well distributed for activity
and powerful effort; his countenance
was smiling and confident, and his age (33
years) sat lightly upon him. His massive
and ungainly antagonist offered a striking
contrast; brown, burly, and, as Paddy
would say, “big for his size,” he grinned
grotesquely at his slighter rival, nor was the
oddity of his mirthful mug by any means
lessened by the fact of his front railings
having been displaced in bygone battles.
He, too, was hard, and had evidently been
brought, by severe training, into as good
condition as we have ever seen him on former
occasions. From the waist to the shoulders
he was a model for a gladiator, but we doubt
if the artist or the sculptor would feel inclined
to copy his capital or his pedestals,
inasmuch as the first is, despite a comic expression
of good-humour, as odd a conglomeration
of features as Gillray or Cruikshank
would desire to pencil; while the latter more
resemble the letter K than the parallel supports
which society has agreed to term symmetrical.
His weight was 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>; his
age twenty-seven, having been born in 1819,
although the displacement of his grinders
gave him a more antique aspect. Little time
was lost in sparring, for the Slasher, his left
presented and his right kept close to the
mark, walked in upon his man, grinning mischief.
Tass let go his left, but was stopped
rather neatly; he broke ground and retreated,
but the Slasher, working round,
forced him into his corner, where several
sharp and rapid exchanges took place, Parker
twice popping in his left, but ineffectively,
and the Slasher countering, in one instance
with a heavy hit on Tass’s chest. After a
little manœuvring, the Tipton, resolved to
force the fighting, stepped gradually in, Tass
retreating, and endeavouring to plant his
favourite job; it was no go; taught by previous
experience, the Tipton would not make
play until his opponent let loose, and then,
with more tact than we have hitherto seen
him display, he countered with his left, and
bringing up his right, caught Tass a sounder
on the ribs. Toss leaped back, but renewed
the hitting merrily, getting down at close
quarters to avoid a return of the Tipton’s
right.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Tass, serious, looked as if measuring
his work; the Tipton grinning. Fast fighting
for big’uns seemed the order of the day.
Tass got in on the Slasher’s mouth, who
followed him fiercely, screwing himself up
for mischief. Tass fought beautifully, but
there seemed little sting in his deliveries;
there was some excellent mutual stopping,
which elicited applause, especially for the
Slasher, of whom it was least expected.
Tass again got in one on the Tipton’s chest,
who returned it with his right, and Tass
went to earth, half with his own consent.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher came up on the grin, and
walked into his opponent without delay.
Parker again fought well, though both were
over fast. Merry work, but little harm
done, till Tass sent his right, straight as an
arrow, on the Tipton’s left jaw, and down
went his house, Parker also falling from his
own blow. An uproarious chevy; first knock-down
for Parker.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Parker came up cautious, with an ugly
cut over the right eyebrow. First blood for
the Slasher. A short round; the Tipton
again drove Tass before him to his corner,
where he got down to avoid.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;As before, the Slasher seemed to have
made up his mind there should be no idling;
no sooner at the scratch than he was at
work. Tass popped at him, but was short,
and the Tipton missed his counter-hit. The
Slasher laughed, and tried it again, but was
stopped. A little rally at the ropes, and
Parker, after an exchange or two, dropped on
his knees.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Tass manœuvring, Tipton fighting, but
not getting home. Tipton’s seconds advised
him to wait for Tass’s play; he did so, and
was rewarded by success. He met Parker,
as he jumped in, with the left, and bringing
up his right gave him a ribber that laid him
on the earth, half doubled up.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Slasher too fast, his opponent too slow.
A short specimen of “You run away, and
see if I don’t come after you.” At length
Tass popped in a blow on Slasher’s shoulder,
who closed. A brief struggle followed; the
Tipton got the crook with his crooked leg,
and threw Tass, falling with his broad base
on his antagonist’s victualling store. It was
a burster (two to one on the Slasher).</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;A short bout of hitting, stopping, and
feinting. Tipton let fly, Tass slipped away
and got down cunning.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Slasher’s left neatly stopped, and
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pageno">198</span>
Parker’s return parried. Parker flared up
for a moment, and got in one, two, but produced
no impression on his man, who went
in laughing. Tass tried to evade him, but
the Slasher closed; both down after a
struggle, during which Tass’s hand was seen
across the Tipton man’s face, and a cry of
“foul” was raised. Some confusion;
Slasher appealed to the referee, charging
Parker with the unmanly act of biting him
in a previous round, when he was in the act
of throwing him, and in this round of an
attempt to injure his eye. The referee
ordered the men to proceed.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Tass came up with a large black
patch on his sinister eyebrow, and his most
prominent feature somewhat damaged.
Tipton eagerly after him, but Tass was too
shifty to be immediately had; he gave the
Slasher two pops; the latter, however, was
with him, and ultimately hit him down.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Tass held his arms almost at full
extent, and manœuvred round his man; the
Slasher, more cautious, faced him steadily.
At length the men got nearer, exchanged
blows, and Tass fell to finish the round.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;So soon as up the Tipton went in, but
Tass declined the compliment, and avoiding
his one, two, which were wasted on thin air,
got down anyhow.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Half a minute’s posturing. Tass
plunged in with his left, but was short; tried
his right, but was stopped. The Slasher got
close, Tass was unable to hit him off, and he
delivered a half-arm pounder with his right.
Tass fell because this time he could not help it.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Tass played with his man; he seemed
more than half tired of his job. The Tipton
leary, and not to be drawn by feints. Slasher
went in, and down tumbled Tass, amidst
shouts of disapprobation.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Parker came up slowly; good stops
on both sides; Tipton, quitting the defensive,
rattled in; Tass rallied sharply, but in the
end received an ugly upper-cut on the dial,
and fell.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Tass somewhat disfigured, while the
Tipton’s ugly mug seemed altogether unaltered.
After some slight exchanges Tass
dropped.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Parker’s tactics seemed at fault; he
sparred a few seconds, but on the Slasher
stepping in, found his way to the ground
rather equivocally.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Tass flared up momentarily. He
tried it on with both hands in succession.
Tipton cleverly foiled him; indeed, Tass did
not get near enough to his man to do work.
Tipton returned. The old game was played&mdash;&#8203;Tass
selected his mother earth.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Tass’s left again short; he was too
fond of long bowls. A close, and Tass got
down as well as he could.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Parker made play, and getting a little
nearer, dropped his bunch of fives on the
Tipton’s mouth; tried it again, but fell
short, and got a left-handed nobber in return
that floored him neatly.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Both Tass’s hands seemed to have
lost their cunning. His heart was not big
enough to carry him in, nor, when there by
accident, to allow him to stand a rally. He
fought badly and out of distance, and at
length scrambled down to avoid the resolute
charge of the Slasher, who gave him a nasty
one on the side of the nut as he was on his
journey to earth.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Perry drove his man all across the
ring. Some pretty exchanges. Parker got
home on Tipton’s dial, who missed the return.
A short, irregular rally. Tass again
got in once or twice, but they seemed mere
taps. At length the Slasher, who had been
screwing himself up, sent out his left
straight as an arrow at his opponent’s head.
The concussion was like the kick of a coach-horse,
took effect at the base of Parker’s
left nostril, and he fell as if shot. “It’s all
over,” was the cry; and the Tipton remained
for some time in the middle of the ring to
favour the company with a few polka steps,
for which his swing leg was peculiarly
adapted.</p>

<p>     23 and last.&mdash;&#8203;Tass, to the astonishment of
all, came up at the call of time, but it was
evident the last hit had been a settler and
had sent his faculties all abroad. Although
he assumed an attitude, he stared perplexedly
at his opponent, and swerved from
the perpendicular as he broke ground. The
Tipton surveyed him a moment before he
stepped forward, but no sooner did Tass
perceive his approach, than, either from
bewilderment or a faint heart, he fell forward
on both knees, and thence on his hands.
The Slasher turned appealingly to the umpires
and referee, without having even
offered to strike. The case was clear; and
amid the shouts of the multitude the Slasher
was greeted as the conqueror. Time, twenty-seven
minutes.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher fought better
than we have seen him on any previous
occasion; his confidence and condition&mdash;&#8203;of
which latter absurd rumours were afloat&mdash;&#8203;were
on a par with his coolness and courage.
To the former he added tact in waiting for
his opponent’s delivery of a blow, and a
skill in counter-hitting for which we did not
give him credit; this, added to his physical
superiority in weight and thews, left his
lighter and more active opponent almost
without a chance, and the contest was reduced
to a mere question of time, the ultimate
result being scarcely within the scope
of doubt. Of the defeated man we can
only say that although he fought three or
four rounds in a spirited&mdash;&#8203;nay, an almost
desperate manner, his conduct in the vast
majority so much savoured of Falstaff’s
“better part of valour,” that his claim to
the character of a game man still remains
unproven, while his attribute of skill, so
loudly vaunted by his infatuated admirers,
has suffered considerably by this exhibition;
this, however, may partly be owing to the
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pageno">199</span>
improvement in his antagonist’s tactics
which, by frustrating his earlier efforts, so
disheartened him that he never showed to
less advantage. The question of superiority
can no longer be mooted; Tass’s quickness
and skill have lost their striking advantage,
while the Slasher’s strength and pluck, on
this occasion seconded by a respectable
amount of science, have by no means fallen
off. Tass’s friends attribute his defeat to
his having had two ribs broken in the seventh
round, from the Slasher falling heavily on
him, and he certainly remained under the
surgeon’s hands, who confirmed the aforesaid
fracture.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>After the above battle, the Tipton Slasher issued a challenge to Caunt
to fight for £100 a side; this Caunt declined to do, and staked £500 in
the hands of the editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, declaring, at the same time, his
willingness to fight the Slasher for £500, but for no smaller sum.
Much angry correspondence passed between them, which is utterly unworthy
of preservation; and in the latter part of 1846 Johnny Broome presented
a belt to the Slasher, whereon Caunt lowered his terms to £200, with a
stipulation that if that condition was not accepted within a month, his
retirement from the Ring was absolute. This, however, was not suitable
to Broome and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, though the Slasher was ready and willing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_20" id="fnanchor_20"></a><a href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span>
</p>

<p>We may hear note, retrospectively, that in December, 1844, yet another
“big ’un” had made his <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">debut</span> in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, who, in a future chapter, will
figure among the numerous candidates for the much-wrangled Championship.
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pageno">200</span>
This was Tom Paddock, who, in the month of December, beat
Elijah Parsons, at Sutton Coldfield. Following this, he twice defeated
Nobby Clarke, a chicken-hearted but scientific 12-stone man, in January,
1846, and in April, 1847. Paddock’s next venture was with the renowned
Bendigo, with whom he lost the battle by a foul blow, June 5, 1850.</p>

<p>In September, 1849, the Tipton, having forfeited to Con Parker, on
account of ill-health, was challenged thereafter by Tom Paddock, soon
after the latter had lost what many thought to be a winning fight with
Bendigo. In this affair, by some shuffling on the part of Perry’s money-finders,
a curious “draw” was manipulated, neither of the parties being
ready to go on at the fourth deposit, on August 22nd, 1850, taking back
their stakes by mutual consent. The Slasher, finding other and more
reliable friends, renewed the articles, and on December 17th, 1850, the
rivals at last came together, face to face, in the ring. The Tipton trained
for this encounter under Levi Eckersley, near Liverpool, while Paddock
had his advice and exercise with Bob Fuller and Jem Turner, than whom
two better trainers did not exist.</p>

<p>On the Monday previous, the Slasher arrived at Tom Spring’s, and
Paddock set up his rest at Jem Burn’s, where they were surrounded by
admiring coteries. The betting was 6 to 4 on the Slasher, whose superior
weight and experience gave him that advantage in the odds.</p>

<p>All requisite arrangements for the meeting had been undertaken by
Spring and Burn, and after sundry cogitations they decided on an excursion-train
on the South Western Railway. Half-past nine on Tuesday
morning was the time named for departure, and long before that hour
arrived, the platform at Waterloo displayed a goodly muster of folks “wot
love a mill,” including many old stagers, “swells,” and patrons of all
degrees. The professors were also numerous in their attendance, and
included twenty men who had been selected to preserve order. We could not
but remark, however, the absence of that quaint fun and humour which,
in the days of Josh Hudson, Jack Scroggins, Young Dutch Sam, and
Frosty-faced Fogo, flung an air of good-humoured frolic on such assemblages,
affording scenes for the pencil of George Cruikshank, and food for
the pen-and-ink sketches of the Ring-historians of the day. To the question
“Whither are we bound?” no response was given. The captain
started with sealed orders, and had a sort of roving commission as to the
place at which he should cast anchor. Suffice it to say, the pace was first-rate
and there was but one stoppage till Bishopstoke was reached. The
<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pageno">201</span>
men were in separate carriages, and there was a wide contrast in their
bearing, Paddock being all mercurial and double jolly, and the Slasher as
solid and steady as Cardinal Wiseman on a fast-day.</p>

<p>It was intended to turn off on the Salisbury line and bring up at Dean,
on the borders of Wilts. The Hampshire police, however, were on the
alert, with an assurance that the Wiltshire folks were equally wide-awake,
and determined to spoil sport. Information to this extent was quickly
conveyed to the managers, and, after a short consultation, “bock agen”
was the order of the day. Various places were mentioned as likely to
afford a quiet and welcome reception, and the first attempt was made
between Andover and Winchfield, but no sooner was the ring pitched than
the Hampshire blues once more hove in sight, and the jaded travellers
had again to enter the carriages. Thus was time wasted, and the hour of
three arrived before the caravan again got under way. It was then agreed
to go to Woking Common, and many bets were offered that the contest
would not come off that day. A strong desire, however, was expressed that
it should be settled, and about half-past three a stoppage was made between
a couple of high embankments, which, on being scaled, exposed to view a
remote corner of Woking Common. The land of promise thus reached,
the office was given, for the last time, to disembark. A site for a ring
was quickly discovered, and although not a very desirable spot, still, it was
the only one to be had, and no time was lost in forming the magic square.
A limited outer ring was also formed, and tickets, at 5s. each, distributed
to those who sought the privilege of a close proximity to the scene of
action, the produce being afterwards equally divided among the ringkeepers.
It was now four o’clock, and the day fast waning; in fact, it
was difficult to distinguish the faces of persons from one side of the ring
to the other; but a clear moon hung out its lamp, and promised a continuance
of light. All being in readiness, Paddock flung his castor into the
ring, following it himself amidst loud cheers. He was attended by Jack
Hannan and Bob Fuller. The Slasher, who was not long after him, was
waited on by Nobby Clarke and Jem Molyneux. Paddock looked fresh,
laughing, and apparently confident; while the Slasher was cool, quiet, and
smiling. After a great deal of difficulty as to the selection of a referee,
both parties agreed upon Ned Donnelly. Jem Burn addressed this functionary
on the part of Paddock, and said all he wanted was a fair and
manly fight, and that there should be no captious objections to any accidental
occurrence. He wished the merits of the men might be fairly
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pageno">202</span>
tested, and only desired that the best man might win. The men now prepared
for action, and at thirty minutes past four, the rising moon looking
modest from the east, and the last rays of the setting sun painting the
western horizon, the gladiators appeared at the scratch, and commenced</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;The men having chosen their
corners, fortune enabled the Slasher to place
his back to the rising moon, so that his toothless
mug was in shade. His herculean frame
was, however, sufficiently visible, and his
easy confidence and quiet deportment increased
the confidence of his friends, and led
all who scanned his proportions to consider
him perfectly competent to hit down a hippopotamus;
or, like the Greek boxer of old,
floor a cantankerous bull, even without the
assistance of the cestus. Paddock, although
when opposed to Bendigo he appeared of the
burly breed, loomed small in contrast with
the Slasher. The disparity in their size was
obvious, and as he jumped about seeking an
opening, a veteran ring-goer exclaimed, “It’s
any odds against the young’un, he’s got his
master before him now.” In fact, the very
style of holding up his hands, and the yokel-like
feints (completely out of distance) with
which he commenced, showed he was puzzled
how to begin the job he had so confidently
undertaken; presently he determined to
chance it, and jumped in. Fortune favours
the bold, and he gave the Slasher a clout on
the jaw-bone with his left, the Tipton hitting
in return on his shoulder or breast, and driving
him back. The Slasher stepped in; Paddock
retreated before him to his corner, hitting
up again, but the Tipton stopped him.
A smart exchange took place, and Paddock
slipped down to get out of mischief.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock began by trying his left twice,
and barely reaching the Slasher, who dealt
him a body blow with the right. Some heavy
hits in weaving style, and a half-round body
blow or two followed, the sound rather than
the effect of the hitting being perceptible.
The Tipton closed with Paddock, who
struggled for a moment, and was then
thrown on his back, the Tipton lending him
thirteen stone additional to hasten his fall.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Two to one on the Tipton. The
Slasher missed Paddock two or three times,
owing to his active, jumping away; still he
steadily pursued him. Paddock tried both
hands, but had the worst of the exchanges;
still there was no harm done. Paddock
made a lunge with the right, but Tipton met
him a smasher, and hit him down, almost
falling over him. First knock-down for the
Slasher.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;It was now stated that Paddock
had dislocated his shoulder; it was no doubt
injured, but not out of joint. He tried his
left in a flurried manner, but the Tipton
feinted with the left, drove him back, and
Paddock fell to avoid.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;The Tipton went to work quickly, but
steadily; he caught Paddock on the body
with the right, and on the left cheek heavily
with the left, as he was jumping round, and
down went Paddock among the bottles in
his own corner.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Tipton gave Paddock no rest or time
for reflection, but pelted away. Paddock
skipped about, and escaped against the ropes;
from his corner, hit up, catching the Tipton
on the side of the neck slightly, and dropped
on one knee. The Tipton might have
given him a finisher, but did not avail himself
of the chance, threw up his hands
and walked away.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock hit Tipton sharply with the
left on the forehead as he came in. Tipton
missed his right, but caught Paddock
a nasty “polthogue” on the nob as he
was going back. Paddock fell on the ropes
but was not down. The Tipton dropped
his hands and came away from him, disdaining
to hit him in that position. “Bravo,
Tipton!”</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;As before; Tipton making the play
and forcing his man, who could not make
head against the attack, and jumped about
like “a parched pea.” Paddock fell at
Tipton’s feet, who, the friends of Paddock
declared, tried to tread on him, and
appealed accordingly. It was a “forlorn
hope,” and the referee said “he saw
nothing foul.”</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock jumped up as usual, just
reaching Tipton’s chin, for which he was
punished with a sounding ribber. Tipton
stepped in, and down dropped Master
Paddock.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Exchanges, but no effects visible,
except a little blood from Paddock’s cheek.
First blood for Tipton. The Tipton hit
out right and left, and caught the Redditch
man on the nob and body, who staggered
half-way across the ring, and fell.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Tipton once again on Paddock’s
body. Paddock fell in the bustle without
a hit.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock shifting and retreating. A
slight exchange, and Paddock fell to avoid.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Tipton forced Paddock into his
corner, but before he could do any mischief
Paddock fell. A claim of “foul,”
but not acknowledged.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Tipton just touched Paddock with his
left, who kept slipping back. Tipton followed
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pageno">203</span>
him, and he dropped. Another appeal
that Paddock fell without a blow, but
the Tipton party waived the objection.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock hit the Tipton, then slipped
half down, jumped up again, and resumed
the fight. Tipton went to work, and hit him
down in the short rally.</p>

<p>     16, 17, 18, and 19.&mdash;&#8203;As like each other as
peas. Slasher made at Paddock, who wouldn’t
stand his charge, and fell to avoid. Appeals.
“We don’t want to win by a foul,” said the
Tiptonians.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock’s right arm hung as if disabled,
but he brought it into play when
action commenced. The Tipton drove him
to the ropes, and hit him down.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, in jumping away, caught
his right heel against the centre stake, and
stumbled down, but jumped up again. Seeing
Tipton close on to him, however, he
dropped on to his knees.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;As the moon got higher, the light improved.
The Tipton, in bustling Paddock,
got a body hit, which he retorted with a
heavy right-hander on Paddock’s smelling
organ, and down he went quite bothered.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock came up with his face painted
carmine colour, and was no sooner at the
scratch than he was down. Another appeal.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Wild exchanges. Paddock on the shift.
The Tipton gave Paddock a topper on the
head, high up, when he fell, and Tipton over
him.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;A slight rally in Paddock’s corner.
Paddock rushed at Tipton, who made an
awkward step back. Paddock pushed rather
than struck at him with the left, and forced
the Tipton over. (Cheers for Paddock.)</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;It was all U.P. Tipton went in with
both hands, and Paddock fell without a blow.
Appeal repeated.</p>

<p>     27 and last.&mdash;&#8203;The odds were the Great
Glass-case of ’51 against a cucumber-frame.
The Tipton gave Master Paddock a pelt on
the head, and began punching at him among
his bottles and traps at the corner stake.
Paddock dropped, and the Tipton, fearing to
give a chance away, was about to return to
his own corner, as he had several times done
when up jumped the Redditch man, and
rushing at the Slasher, lent him such a dig
just at the back of the left ear, with his right,
that down tumbled Tipton, half with astonishment,
half with the blow, and, as Paddy
would say, “the third half of him fell just
because it was not used to stand upright.”
A more palpable “foul” was never seen. The
spectators jumped from their seats, and all
sorts of people got into the ring. The Tipton
walked towards the referee for his decision,
and that functionary pronounced it
“foul;” and so ended the great little fight
for the Championship, in forty-two minutes,
the dial showing twelve minutes after five.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;A Scotch proverb declares&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p class="unindent">and this exhibition was certainly a complete
“pig-shearing” excursion. The Slasher was
not only in splendid condition, but his
method of fighting, long arms, and great experience,
made it no match. True, he was
not to blame that it was so bad a fight, for
as one man can take a horse to water, but
twenty can’t make him drink, so let a man
be ever so willing to make a merry mill of
it, he can’t do so, if his opponent won’t have
it. As to Paddock, he was so manifestly
over-matched, and over-rated, that he had
not the shadow of a chance; and the rush
that proved perilous to Bendigo&mdash;&#8203;old, stale,
under 12 stone, and a practiser of retreating
tactics&mdash;&#8203;was not only useless against the
bulky, firm-standing Slasher, but was certain
destruction to the assailant, from the Tipton’s
tact at countering, his superior strength,
and immense weight. In fact, it was “a
horse to a hen” on all points.</p>

<p>The return to the carriages was as speedy as circumstances and awkward
clayey drains and ditches would permit, but all were safely seated, the
agreeable whistle of departure sounded, and the whole party delivered at
the Nine Elms terminus by six o’clock; the Slasher, merry as a grig,
and loudly cheered, while Paddock complained of severe injury to his
shoulder, which, if serious, was certainly aggravated by his last effort to
do unlawful execution. The Tipton was received at the “Castle” with a
flourish of “See the conquering hero comes!” while Paddock quietly
returned to the “Queen’s Head,” where he received surgical attendance;
and it was officially reported that he “had injured the bone of his shoulder,
and that a sling must be worn as a safeguard against the consequences of
moving the joint.”
</p>
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pageno">204</span>

<p>Once more the Slasher laid claim to the Championship, and requested
that Bendigo would, “according to agreement (?)” hand over the belt which
he had so long held, or, if he declined doing so, the Tipton “would be
proud to give him the chance of retaining it, by meeting him for any sum
he might like to name.” The Tipton further announced his readiness “to
make a match with any man in the world from £200 to £500 a side.”</p>

<p>A fortnight after the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">annonce</span>, a letter appeared from Bendigo, stating
that he would fight for £500 a side, but so far as the belt was concerned,
it had been presented to him as a gift or testimonial, and was his own
property. This vaunt was quickly replied to by the Tipton, who at
once sent £50 to the Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, “to make a match on Bendy’s
own terms,” whereupon the latter backed out, and never after appeared as
a candidate for fistic honours.</p>

<p>Finding that high prices would not command the market, the Tipton
issued another challenge to fight any man for £100 or £200, but for several
months this lay unaccepted. At length, at the latter end of May, 1851,
his former patron and backer, Johnny Broome, appeared in print, accepting
the Slasher’s gage on the part of “an unknown;” Johnny’s favourite mode
of exciting public curiosity in matchmaking. Spring,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_21" id="fnanchor_21"></a><a href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span>
on this occasion,
acted as Perry’s best friend, and declared his readiness to “go on”
upon the name of “the unknown” being declared. What was the surprise
of the “knowing ones” when Johnny declared his brother Harry to be the
“veiled prophet,” on whose future championship he would wager £200,
while Harry, who was present, stepped smilingly forward and modestly
declared his candidature. The Tipton “grinned horribly a ghastly smile,”
and could hardly be persuaded as he “saw Young Harry with his
beaver up,” gallantly and coolly affirming his readiness to second
his brother’s words by deeds. The Tipton, as Michaelmas day (September
29) was named as “no quarter-day,” at once went into training at Hoylake,
in Cheshire, under the care of Jem Wharton and Jem Ward. How
they met, and how the Slasher lost the fight, without a scratch, by his own
clumsy precipitancy, must be read in the Life and Career of Harry
Broome, in a future chapter of this volume.</p>

<p>Broome, on the giving up of the stakes, professing his readiness to maintain
his title against all comers, accepted the offer of the Tipton to settle
the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexata quæstio</span> by another meeting, and articles were drawn up, and
<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pageno">205</span>
deposits to the amount of £25 made good, when Harry forfeited, on the
plea that he had a match on (it came to nothing) with Aaron Jones, and
had also accepted an engagement with Paddock. Curiously enough, the
Slasher, who now dubbed himself “Champion,” afterwards signed articles
with both these men, who both forfeited to him; Aaron Jones to the tune
of £70, in July, 1856, and Paddock (whom he had formerly beaten), to
the amount of £80, in October following.</p>

<p>Perry, who had been twenty-one years before the public, now became a
publican and vendor of eatables and drinkables in a canvas caravansery at
races, fairs, and all sorts of rural gatherings in the Black Country.</p>

<p>All this time the star of a 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> champion had been rapidly rising
on the pugilistic world. Tom Sayers, having polished off the middle-weights,
had been playing havoc among the “big ’un’s;” in 1856 defeating
Harry Poulson (who had once beaten Paddock), and, in 1857, Aaron
Jones fell beneath his conquering arm.</p>

<p>Six years had elapsed when “The Old Tipton,” as he was now popularly
designated, was dared to the field by this new David. Right cheerfully
did the old “Philistine man of might”&mdash;&#8203;for the Tipton never lacked
personal courage&mdash;&#8203;respond to the “little ’un’s” crow. How the oft-repeated
error of “trusting the issue of battle to waning age,” was again
exemplified on the 16th of June, 1857, at the Isle of Grain, when the once
formidable Slasher was conquered in the contest for £400 and the Champion’s
belt by the marvellous little miller, Tom Sayers, may be read by
those who are curious in minute details, in the life of that phenomenal
pugilist, in Chapter <abbr title="Eleven">XI.</abbr> of this volume. This was the closing scene of the
Tipton’s long and chequered career. He retired, defeated but not dishonoured,
to his native county and early associates. In his latter days
the Tipton is said to have never refused “a drink for the good of the
house,” said house being his own special “tap.” Death finally overtook
him, rather suddenly, at his home, near Wolverhampton, on January 18,
1881, in his sixty-first year.</p>

 From this period Freeman returned to his theatrical and professional circus exhibitions,
in which his gigantic size attracted the popular wonderment. He was a careless, good-natured
fellow; and it was stated by the medical officers of Winchester Hospital, where the
emaciated giant died of consumption on the 18th of October, 1845, that he had within him
the fatal seeds of pulmonary disease from his first period of manhood. His end was of
necessity accelerated by repeated colds, caught in the light attire of fleshings and spangles,
in which he exhibited in draughty canvas erections, and crowded theatres and booths. This
last remark is drawn from us by a senseless paragraph, in which a Hampshire penny-a-liner
endeavoured to “improve the occasion” by suggesting that the early death of the good-natured,
soft-headed acrobat was due to the dreadful injuries “he must necessarily have received
in his terrible combat with the formidable bruiser known as the Tipton Slasher&mdash;&#8203;injuries
which from the tremendous stature of the combatants, must have been beyond ordinary
calculation.” To this it may fairly be replied that the few fatal results on record from
battles between big men is actually phenomenal&mdash;&#8203;Andrew M’Kay (June, 1830) and Simon
Byrne (May, 1833) being the only two on record; the others resulting from contests between
middle or light weights, and several of these regrettable fatalities being proved by subsequent
surgical examination to have resulted from accident, excitement, or apoplexy, induced
by violent exertion.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_20"><span class="muchsmaller">[20]</span></a>
 Not to complicate this confusion of “claimants” for the belt, we may here state that
while Caunt, Bendigo, the Deaf’un, and the Tipton were playing duettos, trios, and quartettes,
as leading performers in the discordant overture to the farce of “Who’s the Champion?”
there was no lack of accompanying instrumentalists, each blowing his own trumpet
of defiance, and thumping the big drum of “benefit” bounce. At the end of 1845, Caunt
introduced a new candidate in the person of a formidable black, standing a trifle over six
feet, and weighing hard upon 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, who, rather curiously, dubbed himself William
Perry! This mysterious “darkey” displayed such remarkable talent with the gloves, and
was, in many respects, a man of such superior address and conversation, that he might
well have been expected to turn out more than a second Molyneux. As, however, the proof
of all pudding, whether black or white, is in the eating, an opponent was sought for the
American importation. Bill Burton, of Leicester, a much smaller man, standing five feet
nine, and weighing 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, was selected. Burton’s credentials were good; he had
defeated Angelo, of Windsor, in May, 1845&mdash;&#8203;a game contest of seventy-four rounds&mdash;&#8203;and
had been previously victor in many unrecorded affairs. The meeting took place on the 20th
January, 1846. The Black more than justified the anticipations of his backers. He
defeated Burton with the greatest ease in fifteen rounds, the Leicester man’s friends
humanely throwing up the sponge at the end of twenty-four minutes of a hopeless, one-sided
contest. This was the first and last appearance of the so-called William Perry in the
English <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> He proved to be connected with a gang of forgers of American bank-notes,
and having been previously imprisoned more than once, he was now transported to the Antipodes,
being provided with passage to Australia at Government expense, where, it would
appear, he became a ticket-of-leave man, as he is recorded as having defeated Hough, the
“Champion of Australia,” at Cumming’s Point, Sydney, in December, 1849. In the last-named
year (1849) another “big ’un” came out, but quietly went in again. This was Con
(Cornelius) Parker, standing six feet, and weighing 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>; his first victory was over
Jem Bailey (Irish), in the Essex Marshes, February 13th, 1849. He then received forfeit
from the Tipton in the same year; but, on November 26th, also in 1849, he had his “championship”
pretensions ignominiously snuffed out at Frimley, in Surrey, by Tass Parker, who
somewhat retrieved the disgrace of his double defeat by the Tipton, by triumphantly thrashing
Mister Con, who ended the battle by a “foul.” Con then emigrated to America, where
he died rather suddenly, on the 2nd December, 1854, at Buffalo, U.S. Soon after Tass took
the money for this victory, his friends injudiciously claimed for him the title of “Champion,”
but Tass wisely declined, in a letter, such a prominent position.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="h4head">NICHOLAS (NICK) WARD.<br />
1835&ndash;1841.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> claim of Nick Ward to a chapter in a History of the Ring is,
though certainly slender, of a twofold character. In the first place, as
another and more recently fallen warrior was described as “the nephew
of his uncle,” so Nick Ward may be signalised as “the brother of Jem;”
the second, and more cogent, reason is the high flight of his ambition, and
the consequent eminence of his adversaries, he having beaten Deaf
Burke, and, by a fluke, won a fight for the Championship with the modern
“Big Ben.” These things premised, we proceed to a brief sketch of his
quasi-pugilistic performances.</p>

<p>Nick Ward was born on an ominous day, the 1st of April, in the year
1811, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s-in-the-East, London; and on February 24th, 1835,
having previously acquired a reputation in the sparring-schools of the
Metropolis, he stripped at Moulsey Hurst, to face John Lockyer, of Cranbrook,
a yokel bruiser of about 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, whose only scored victory was a
win with one Bridger, of Maidstone, in February, 1833. Jack Lockyer
(named “Harry,” in <cite>Fistiana</cite>, under <span class="sc">Ward</span>) was a mere chopping-block
in the skilful hands of Nick, his longer-reached and more artistic antagonist;
and being “satisfied” at the end of 18 rounds, gave no criterion
by which to judge of Young Nick’s game or endurance. It was pretty
evident, however, that his brother and friends were not much taken with
this initiative display of his qualities, for the next match looked out for
Master Nick was with a 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> man, Jem Wharton (afterwards celebrated as
“Young Molyneaux,” and “the Morocco Prince”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_22" id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span>
) for £15 a side. The
deposits were made good, and the day, May 12th, 1835, fixed Nick Ward’s
<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pageno">207</span>
backer having won the toss for choice of place (within thirty miles of
London) named the well-known Moulsey Hurst as the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">champ clos</span> of
combat.</p>

<p>On the appointed Tuesday, the patrons of the fistic art were on the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui
vive</span> to witness the tourney between “the brother of the Champion” and
the aspiring “Young Molyneaux”&mdash;&#8203;a worthy, albeit a miniature, counterpart
of the dusky gladiator of the same name, who, in times gone by, twice
fell beneath the all-conquering arm of Cribb, as may be read by those who
are curious in the first volume of this work.</p>

<p>Nick went into training at Norwood, putting up at the “Rose and
Crown,” our old friend Ned Neale’s hostelrie, and, as we thought, making
himself rather more of a public character in the neighbourhood than was
either prudent or desirable. Nevertheless, all looked, thus far, promising.
Of betting there was little or none; for such was the confidence in favour
of Ward, that three to one was offered, but no takers&mdash;&#8203;a circumstance attributable
to his superiority in science, length, and weight (for he weighed
12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, while the Black was more than a stone under that standard, as
well as being much shorter). It was still thought there would be excellent
sport afforded, and there were those who, although not disposed to risk
their rhino, yet entertained “a shrewd suspicion” that the Black would
win. The necessary preparations were made for conveying the men to the
scene of action on Tuesday morning; but, unluckily, on the evening before
a “stopper” was placed upon Ward, who was apprehended (on the authority
of a warrant issued by the magistrates at Union Hall), and taken before
Mr. Ellyard, a local magistrate at Norwood, by whom he was held to bail
to keep the peace towards all his Majesty’s subjects in general, and the
Black Prince in particular. The unpleasant intelligence was soon conveyed
to town, and produced no small panic in the minds of those to
whose knowledge it came; but a vast number remained in ignorance of
the fact till the next day, when too late to save them the expense and
trouble of a long trot. The road to Hampton on Tuesday presented the
customary bustle, and it was not till the throng congregated in hundreds
in view of the Hurst, that the rumours with which they were assailed on the
road were confirmed. Great indignation was, of course, expressed, and
various speculations were afloat as to the author of the mischief; some
attributing the step to Jem Burn or his party, and others to the malice of
some secret enemy of the sports of the Ring. There was, however, no help
for it, and as it was found that orders were also given to prevent “any
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pageno">208</span>
breach of the peace” on Moulsey Hurst, it was resolved to seek consolation
in a minor mill, which was yet to the good, in a meadow about two
miles from Hampton, whither the ropes and stakes were conveyed, followed
by a countless succession of go-carts, and vehicles of a more aristocratic
description, which joined in the motley cavalcade.</p>

<p>This “little go” we may note in a parenthesis. It was between Evans
(nicknamed “the Pumpborer”), and an aspirant who contented himself
with the title of “Jack January’s brother.” These “obscurities” having
punished each other for seventy minutes, Evans was hailed the victor.</p>

<p>We ought to state that Wharton was driven on to the ground in style,
looking bright as “Day and Martin’s Japan,” and jauntily tossed his hat
into the ring, his “soul in arms and eager for the fray.” This was,
however, a mere matter of form, as “magisterial interference” having
placed his antagonist out of harm’s way, no forfeit could be claimed. The
mischance, of course, excited much speculation among the disappointed, as
to the author of the interruption, some attributing it to the friends of the
Black, and others to the partisans of Ward; while a third party laid the
blame, and not without fair ground of suspicion, to some dog in the manger,
who, disliking the sports of the Ring himself, determined to deprive others
of a pleasure in which he did not choose to participate. There was nothing
in the character of the match to warrant a belief that the backers of either
man had a sufficient motive for declining the contest. The stakes were
trifling, and made up by subscription, so that the loss in this way could not
have been worth consideration. The expenses of training had already
been incurred, handkerchiefs bought, and vehicles to take the men to the
ground engaged. Both men were in first-rate condition, and both, notwithstanding
the disparity in their size, equally confident, and more especially
Wharton, who booked winning, and nothing else; and then, as to the
betting, there were no bets made which could have influenced any of the
contracting parties to contrive a “draw.” The real cause of the fiasco,
which was never clearly made out, may be surmised, when read by the
knowledge acquired by subsequent events; and, without much damage to
young Nick’s reputation, we may conclude that he had “no stomach for the
fight,” and was secretly glad that the affair had a bloodless termination by
“magisterial interference,” and his being formally bound over, for a whole
twelvemonth, “to keep the peace towards all her Majesty’s subjects.”</p>

<p>From this time (May, 1835), Nick merely exhibited with the gloves, in
“brother Jem’s” saloon, or at other “assaults of arms,” for benefits, &amp;c.,
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pageno">209</span>
though his name appears as “challenged by Burke, Hampson, Brassey,
Fisher, Bailey, and other “big ’uns.”</p>

<p>On the 24th May, 1836, Bendigo beat Brassey at Sheffield, and three
days afterwards, on Friday, the 27th, Jem Ward, Brother Nick, Jem
Burn, Bendy, and an aristocratic assemblage of “swells,” were at Tottenham,
where, at a private farm, there was some “cocking.” The facetious
Sambo Sutton, too, was among the company; and as a sequel to the sports
of the pit, at a merry meeting at mine host Harry Milbourne’s, there
was some lively chaff about the late “black job;” the said chaff being
specially promoted by Jem Burn, who was retorted upon (he being the
patron of “Young Molyneaux,” and now of the eccentric “Sambo”) as
a dealer in sable specimens of humanity. Some reflections on Nick’s pluck
being of a very “pale complexion,” led to an offer to match him against
Burn’s latest “new black,” and on Massa Sambo enthusiastically declaring
how delighted he would be “jest to hab a roun’ or two,” Nick “screwed his
courage to the sticking-place,” and a “purse” being at once subscribed,
“a field near Finchley” was offered by a sporting gentleman present, and
off the whole party started. At this time Sambo was only known, beyond
some sparring capabilities, to be a merry mountebank of the original
Ethiopian order, and is described in a contemporary paper as having “a
head like a cow-cabbage, a mouth laughing all across his face, and possesing
an extraordinary faculty of standing upon his flat head, with his flatter
feet flourishing in the air, dancing and singing for an hour together, and
varying the fun by drinking miscellaneous liquors in that uncomfortable
position.” To these accomplishments, says the writer, “he adds great bodily
strength, long arms, and such a gluttonous appetite for ‘towelling’ that
nobody can give him enough with the gloves.” The affair was really got
up as an experiment to try Nick’s mettle, and such was the consequence
drawn from his “blood and breeding,” that two and three to one on him
were offered, but no takers.</p>

<p>The fight did not take place until seven in the evening, when the real P.C.
ropes and stakes were got down from town, and pitched in an excellent
spot, hidden from the North Road, Finchley, by a rising ground. Jack
Adams and Fitzmaurice waited on Ward, Byng Stocks and Jack Clarke
on Sambo.</p>

<p>For the first ten rounds Nick took the lead in good style, nobbing his
man neatly, stopping his attempts at returning, and gaining first blood in
the third round. Sambo also made some very clever stops, and now and
<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><span class="pageno">210</span>
then got home a sort of swinger on Nick’s ribs; nevertheless, he was down
anyhow at the end of each round. Still, he rolled about like an india-rubber
tombola, and when he did get in a “little ’un” the “big ’un” seemed to
jump away, and fight very shy till he could himself “get on” again.
Ward came up, once or twice, “blowing” in a manner that did not indicate
first-rate condition. In the eleventh round, Sambo being pretty
considerably cut about the head, Adams called on Nick to “go in and
finish him;” Nick tried to obey orders. He caught the Nigger a slashing
hit on the head, which Sambo took kindly, merely shaking it; and, darting
in, he drew Ward’s cork from his smelling-bottle so suddenly that a gush
of claret followed; Nick made an involuntary backward step, and Sambo
bustled him down. The “clerks of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas” looked blank.</p>

<p>Ward came up slowly for round 12, when Sambo went in furiously.
Ward met him a hot ’un on the nob; but the darkey would not be denied,
and in a wild sort of rally Sambo caught Master Nick such an awful chop
on the smeller, as they were both going down, that Ward was under, by his
own consent, and the tap again copiously turned on. This was enough.
Nick declared he would “have no more of it.” Remonstrance was useless:
“he would fight no longer,” and the sponge was thrown up. Sambo,
shaking his head like a black and red rag-mop, cut a “break-down” caper,
and sang a song of triumph which defied the art of stenography, while
Ward hurried off, amidst the laughter and cheering of the assembly, like a
“trundle-tailed cur,” declaring, “it was no use, he was not cut out for a
fighting man!” an assertion, in the words of the old song, “Which nobody
can deny, deny, Which nobody can deny.”</p>

<p>After this public manifestation that whatever “devil” there may be in
“Old Nick” his young namesake was endowed with none of that fiery
quality, “the Champion’s brother” confined himself to “attitude,” the
horse-hair pads, and, in the words of pugilistic M.C.’s., to “walking round
and showing his muscle.” Meantime the “cow-cabbage hero” kept continually
challenging him to another bout “in the reg’lar ring,” while
starring it on sparring tours at Cambridge, Oxford, and elsewhere&mdash;&#8203;for
Sambo was an immense favourite among the “’Varsity men.” At last the
smoke kindled into a flame, and out came Nick, with a declaration that he
would “no longer stand this black buffoon’s bounce.” Articles were
accordingly signed, a match made for £50 a side, and the stakes deposited
in the hands of old Tom Cribb. Tuesday, the 27th March, 1838, was
named as the day, half-way between Birmingham and London as the
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">211</span>
place of battle; for though the deposits were made in town it was not a
metropolitan match. Nick Ward’s money was found by brother Jem and
certain Liverpool supporters; while the funds for Sambo were readily raised,
principally by some Oxford friends. Ward went into training at Crosby,
near Liverpool, under the immediate eye of his brother and Peter Taylor.
Sambo did his breathings and gymnastics at a village near Oxford city.
Both men were reported to be in tip-top condition, and eager for the fray&mdash;&#8203;Nick
to refurbish his tarnished reputation, and rub off the stain of pusillanimity,
and Sambo, as he said, “’cos him like to hab anoder slap at Massa
Ward, him so clebber at get away&mdash;&#8203;but p’raps not dis time;” and he shook
his woolly nob like a black Burleigh. It was the desire of the London division
that, under the shadow of the untoward result of the encounter between
Owen Swift and Brighton Bill (March 13th, 1838), a postponement of the
meeting should take place; but time would not permit, in those days of slow
communication, to have a conference on the subject, so matters took their
course. Ward, having won the toss, named Bicester, in Oxfordshire (the
recent scene of the defeat of Byng Stocks, of Westminster, by Hammer
Lane, of Birmingham), a town distinguished for the jovial character and
sporting propensities of its inhabitants. Thither were the ropes and stakes
sent. The Commissary being laid up with the gout, and unable to
accompany them, Jack Clarke was deputed to officiate, he being on the spot,
and acting as trainer to Massa Sambo. As we feel best satisfied when
we write from personal observation, we may note that on Monday
afternoon we found ourselves comfortably seated in a room at the
“King’s Arms,” Bicester, a house distinguished for solid customers, and
them boasting a host of high sporting quality. There was no bustle
in the town, which at that time was quiet as a Quakers’ meeting;
none of the “old familiar faces” were visible. The London Fancy&mdash;&#8203;and we
think they were right&mdash;&#8203;had determined that all matches should be postponed
for a certain period. Hence, not a single familiar phiz graced the scene.
It is true the town was enlivened by the presence of Sir Henry Peyton,
with his spicy four-in-hand, and there, too, was Lord Chetwynd, on his
cover-hack; but we could not help thinking, as his lordship gave us a sly
nod of recognition, that there was a curious expression in his jolly face, as
he made us aware that there had been “magisterial business” at the Town
Hall, as a sort of reason <em>why</em> we saw him there. This was soon confirmed
by a sporting friend, whom we fearlessly set down as that <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">lusus naturæ</span>,
“an honest lawyer.” He told us, with regret, that “the Philistines were
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">212</span>
abroad,” and that the Home Office, urged on by the twaddle of “My Grandmother”
(the <cite>Morning Herald</cite>), and the goody-goody papers, with the awful
denunciations of the supineness or complicity of the magistracy of Cambridgeshire
and Herts in the melancholy affair of Swift and Phelps, had
sent down warnings and counsels for extra vigilance to the police and magistracy
of Oxford and Bucks. That “all this was sooth” we had afterwards
reason to find. Sambo, we learned, had been at Lainton, about two
miles from the town, but, as a measure of precaution, he was moved from a
public to a private house, and in the domicile of an honest yeoman met
with that kindly hospitality by which this class of our countrymen was
characterised. Here he was thought perfectly safe, and all that was now
wanting was the arrival of Jem Ward, or some emissary from him, to
agree upon some less dangerous point of meeting. It was understood that
Ward had been advised to stop short of Bicester, but it was fully expected
that he would appear at head-quarters to settle upon preliminaries. Every
avenue was watched, yet up to nine o’clock no tidings of him were heard,
and although the country was scoured over a circuit of three-and-twenty
miles, after nine o’clock, in search of him, and every village visited, his
presence could not be discovered, for the best of all reasons, that he had
stopped short at Banbury, and did not come forward till the morning, nor
send any person forward to announce his proximity. This was more than
mortifying, for it was soon seen that the magistrates of Buckinghamshire
became more active, and a constable was despatched by the venerable and
amatory Sir John Chetwood, with a warrant for the apprehension of
Sambo, which was backed by an Oxfordshire magistrate. The constable
thus entrusted was more than usually active in his vocation, and endeavoured,
by every means in his power, to ferret out his sable prey: an
activity, no doubt, very praiseworthy, but which led him into an adventure
far from agreeable, and certainly likely to remain impressed on his
memory. While grunting about, like a boar looking for a pig-nut, he met
with a wag who informed him, on a solemn promise of secresy, that
Sambo was stowed away in a <em>badger-box</em>, which he knew to be placed in
an enclosed paddock behind the house of the honest lawyer to whom we
have already alluded, and whose zoological collection was known, far and
near, as being of an extensive and curious description. “A nod is as good
as a wink to a blind horse,” so Mister Constable, cock-sure of having
marked down his game, silently stole into the paddock, where
stood the long badger-box, of which he determined, from that instant,
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">213</span>
never to lose sight until its occupant should disclose himself. Night was
fast approaching, but it was clear and fine, so, after duly reconnoitring,
the “copper” cautiously approached the box, and, tapping on the lid, in
soothing terms invited Mister Sutton to come out and surrender, as he was
“wanted,” or else, badger or no badger, he must be “drawn.” As Sambo
was about two miles off he made no answer, so the invitation was repeated
in more peremptory tones, but with no more success. “Bobby” became
irate at what he considered nigger obstinacy, so he turned the button and
thrust his hand into the sacking, and so into the round hole at the top,
with the view of lifting the lid. Rash experiment! the lawful tenant&mdash;&#8203;a
badger, not of African, but of British breed&mdash;&#8203;was “at home,” but not to
Home Office visitors. Without growl, bark, or other warning, the sharp-toothed
“varmint” revenged the violation of his sanctum by seizing the
digits of the assailant of his castle, and nearly severing the top joints of
at least three of his fingers. The luckless constable raised so loud an
exclamation that forth rushed a favourite old retriever hight “Nelson,”
who gave tongue so loudly that, though “his bark was worse than his bite,”
it was lucky he was on the chain, or, perchance, the seat of the rural’s
inexpressibles might have been absent without leave before he succeeded
in clearing the low wall into the high road, whence he lost no time in
making his way to the village surgery, and thence, his dexter fin, as the
police-reporters say, “enveloped in surgical bandages,” he hastened to “report”
himself and his adventure to his superior officers. The mischievous
author of the hoax did not fail to spread the story of the success of his severe
practical joke, and for some time it was dangerous, but not uncommon, for
labourers and impertinent boys to address the query to the Buckinghamshire
constables of “Who drew the badger?” without receiving a civil or
satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning Sambo was still at the house of his friend, few
knowing his whereabouts; when it transpired that every route from
Bicester into Northamptonshire was closely watched to prevent the escape
of Sambo, or the approach of Ward. It was therefore determined to cover
his retreat by a “ruse,” which was thus arranged. A countryman was
engaged by a bribe to allow his face to be blacked with cart-grease and
soot, his neck encircled by Sambo’s colours (white with a blue border),
wrapped in a white box-cloth driving coat, and sent off towards Oxford at
as good a pace as a pair of posters could carry him. But alas! great
conceptions often meet with untoward interruptions. One of the Buckinghamshire
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pageno">214</span>
“badger-drawers” discovered from a chawbacon lout the
exact hiding place of the sable-fox, and carried the intelligence to Sir
John Chetwood; then returning, with the baronet close at his heels, he
boldly knocked at the door of the house, which was opened by a servantgirl.
Demanding to see her master, and the wench stoutly refusing him
admittance, he gallantly pulled out a pistol, and presenting it, marched on
in triumph. Walking into the back-parlour, “from information he had
received,” he at once recognised the real Sambo, and, producing his warrant,
made a quiet capture of his prisoner. At this moment Lord Chetwynd,
with attendants, rode up and joined Sir John Chetwood, so that “the
majesty of the law” was fully represented at the capture of his Sable
Highness. On reaching the front of the house, however, Sambo made a
cunning and bold attempt at an escape from his “buckra” enemies. In vain;
he was quickly overtaken and secured, and forthwith conveyed to Buckingham.
Our friend the “honest lawyer” was not far off. He went back to
Bicester, took a postchaise and pair, enlisted a friend and “householder,”
and without hesitation followed the captive “Black Prince,” put in the
required sureties, and restored him to freedom. Meantime the first news
was received of Ward, that he and his friends were at Middleton, a village
three miles off, and were awaiting Sambo’s arrival. It was now too late.
A Mercury was despatched to Nick and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, advising him to make himself
scarce, as he too might be “wanted;” a hint which was in season, for,
in an hour after, Lord Chetwynd and company were on the road to
Middleton, where they arrived in time to find that the bird had flown.
Ward, his brother, and friends, of course returned to Liverpool, and
Sambo, though “bound over,” was at liberty to dance, sing, tumble, spar,
and “jump Jem Crow,” a free man in all things but a “free fight.”</p>

<p>Another twelvemonth of rustication ended in a match with Jem
Bailey, a 12 stone Irishman (not “Bailey of Bristol”), and the fight was fixed
for January 14th, 1839, the stake £25 a side. This went off in a forfeit
by Bailey, as did another match made by Ward himself. In October,
however, after some clever and vicious “gloving,” and a very strong expression
of opinion by Bailey of Nick’s mode of “cutting” it when
“tackled,” two spirited gents, in the habit of frequenting Alec Reid’s
sparring-room, Frith Street, Soho, expressed a willingness to back Bailey
for £25 against Ward, who immediately found backers to that amount
among some amateurs in the art of self-defence, at Owen Swift’s, in Tichborne
Street. As the match was only made about a week before the day
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
fixed&mdash;&#8203;October 18th, 1839&mdash;&#8203;there was not much time allowed for training.
Ward went to Acton for two or three days, but Bailey, we are informed,
did not employ his leisure hours quite so profitably as many considered he
ought to have done under the circumstances.</p>

<p>On the Thursday the whole of the stakes were deposited in the hands of
Owen Swift, at the “Coach and Horses,” Frith Street, Soho, in the
presence of a numerous assemblage of the Fancy, when a long discussion
ensued respecting the place where the fight should come off. On the part
of Ward it was contended that “down the river,” would be preferable to any
other place, inasmuch as they were the less likely to be interfered with in
that quarter than if they went out of town per railroad, as the partisans of
Bailey wished. It was, however, decided that Ditton Marsh should be
visited, and the majority of those who were in the secret repaired to the
Southampton terminus at Nine Elms, by nine o’clock on the following
morning (Friday), while some who possessed fast “tits” preferred the road.
The Fancy having comfortably seated themselves in the train, in the full
expectation of not meeting with any annoyance by the presence of a
“beak,” were not a little flabbergasted by observing Mr. Hedger and
several other magistrates of Surrey enter one of the first-class carriages.</p>

<p>“What could they do there at that early hour?” was the very natural
inquiry, which query was not satisfactorily solved till the gentlemen in Her
Majesty’s commission took their departure at Kingston, where it appears their
presence was necessary at the Sessions. Never did the lovers of boxing part
company with their travelling companions with a greater degree of satisfaction
than they did with their worships. Ditton Station having been
announced by the attendants of the railway, the train was nearly cleared of
its passengers, and the veteran Commissary and his coadjutor, Little Jack,
were not long in fixing the stakes and ropes at the further end of the common,
on the left of the station. Some delay, however, ensued in consequence of
the articles not stating that the men were to fight in accordance with the
new rules of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, and the circumstance of several parties refusing to take
office under the old regulations. Alec Reid, who wished the fight to proceed
in accordance with the articles, at length gave way, and it was agreed the new,
and certainly more manly and humane laws, should be adopted. All the
necessary preliminaries were then adjusted, and the men entered the ring.</p>

<p>Previous to the commencement of hostilities a good deal of betting took
place at 6 to 4 on Ward, and Bailey accepted those odds with an eagerness
which showed he had great confidence in himself.
</p>
<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pageno">216</span>

<p>Bailey, a native of the Emerald Isle, in height 5 feet 11 inches, weighing
12 st. 2 lb., aged 28, was well known in the neighbourhood of Norwich,
where they thought him good enough to match him against the renowned
Brassey, of Bradford, on two occasions, on both of which he was, of course,
thrashed.</p>

<p>King Dick and Harry Holt, the “Cicero” of the Fancy, attended on
Ward; the Essex Youth and a gallant son of Mars waited on Bailey.
All being in readiness, the men peeled, and at twenty minutes past ten
commenced</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Neither, from the circumstances
above stated, looked quite up to the
mark as regards condition, but a smile of
confidence played on the features of both.
Ward’s attitude was easier and more scientific
than Bailey’s, who stood in a straggling and
ungainly manner. They kept at a respectful
distance from each other for some time,
when Ward let fly with his left, and caught
his man on the top of the head; an exchange
of blows ensued, when they broke
away from each other. Bailey, however,
soon made play, and in the close Ward went
down.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;No damage done. Bailey came up
smiling to the scratch. He tried it on with
his right, but the hit was too round to take
much effect on Ward’s side; the latter then
went to work, but neither in their exchanges
did any mischief. In the close Bailey tried
for the cross-buttock, but he slipped and
fell.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Both quickly resumed business, and
as quickly closed, when some fibbing ensued,
which Bailey had the best of, and both went
down together. [Loud shouts for Bailey,
from whose mouth, however, a little claret
appeared.]</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;The smile on Bailey’s mug soon disappeared
on Ward popping in his left on the
nob sharply, and another on the sinister
ogle. In the close Bailey was under.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Bailey made play, but received a clean
counter-hit just above his right peeper,
which evidently severed one of the small
veins, for the crimson stream spurted forth
in profusion; Bailey then closed on his opponent,
who went down.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;The left hand of Ward was evidently
damaged from coming in contact with the
knowledge box of Bailey, who made play
with his right, but was admirably stopped;
a close, Bailey bored to the ropes, when Ward
tried the upper-cut, but missed his man, who
dropped down at the corner.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Bailey came up smiling, and a good
fighting round took place in favour of Ward,
who again went down at the close to avoid
any punishment he might receive at infighting.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;After some sparring Ward shot out his
left bang on the mug of Bailey, and kept
countering him till they closed, when Nick cut
work for a time by going down. [Much
dissatisfaction was expressed at Ward’s
conduct in dropping.]</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;The frontispiece of Bailey exhibited
marks of severe punishment, and in addition
to other hits, his left cheek-bone had received
a nasty one, still he came up to his man
courageously, and in trying it on with his
right received a counter-hit, which however,
missed the intended spot, and fell on the
shoulder; a close, when Nick released himself
in the usual way by going down.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Ward again at work with his left,
which slightly fell on the nob; a close, and
before Bailey could get a good hit at him,
Nick dropped.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Bailey made play, but missed his antagonist,
and in a scramble Ward fell.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;The expressions of disapprobation
at Ward’s continually going down were now
so general that Ward smilingly exclaimed
on coming up to the scratch “Bailey, don’t
find fault; why should you?” Ward tried
his left, but was stopped; he then put in his
right, which slightly took effect on the nob;
a rally, when Ward dropped on his knees,
and Bailey was very near hitting him in
that position.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Ward put in a chin-chopper; a rally
to the ropes, and both down together, if
anything, Ward under.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;The left hand of Ward quickly visited
the headpiece of Bailey, who rushed in, but
it was “no go,” for his man went down as
formerly.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Ward led off, but missed the intended
visitation, when Bailey went in, and for
once succeeded in giving Nick the upper
cut, which made a slight incision over the
eyebrow.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Bailey again felt Ward’s left on the
canister, and the latter got away without
a return, and was quickly down.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">217</span>

<p>At this point, twenty-five minutes having elapsed, a policeman well
mounted was seen in the distance, and the combatants had the office to
“cut,” which they quickly did. The man in blue on arriving at the ring
pulled out his “toasting fork,” and requested an old farmer, named
Weston (who was also mounted, and had previously appeared to take extreme
interest in the battle), to point out the fighting men. The jesuitical
veteran, with evident pleasure, was about doing so, but both men escaped
unperceived to a barn opposite. As the policeman expressed his determination
to follow the parties, and prevent hostilities, a council of war was
held, and it was decided that the train should be again had recourse to,
and Woking Common the place of rendezvous. The Woking station
was reached a little after one, and in less than half an hour the stakes were
fixed in a retired spot at the end of the lane across the Common.</p>

<p>Here seventeen more rounds were fought in about thirty minutes, when
the same style of fighting ensued as that above described, Ward, however,
not going down <em>quite</em> so frequently as heretofore. Bailey received additional
pepper on his mug, while Ward scarcely exhibited any marks of punishment.
Many of the rounds were remarkable for their non-effect on either side,
and their scrambling struggles were more like those of two big boys at
school than men in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> In the 12th round Bailey had the best of it,
but “bad was the best.”</p>

<p>A dispute arose in the 15th round, Bailey having slipped down without
a blow, but the fight was ordered to be proceeded with. In the next bout,
after a short rally, Ward dropped to avoid in-fighting, when Bailey certainly
struck Nick on the ribs while he was on his knees. The referee,
however, gave a contrary opinion, and the men came to the scratch for the
17th time at this place, and the 33rd in the whole. They soon went to
work, and immediately after closing Ward went down, when Bailey, it was
said, again struck him foul.</p>

<p>The referee was once more appealed to, who decided that Bailey, although
evidently accidentally, had hit his man when down. Ward immediately proceeded
to the corner to untie the colours, which was resisted by Bailey,
who “pitched into him,” and bored him with his neck against the ropes.
They were soon separated, and Ward left the ring with his friends, Bailey
reluctantly following.</p>

<p>The fight, <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> remarks, did not in any way come up to the expectations
of those who had travelled so far to witness it. Bailey is as
game a man as ever entered the ring, but he has very little knowledge of
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">218</span>
the art, and as for countering, it appears such an idea never entered his
head. His position is also bad, being too wide and straggling. Ward is a
scientific boxer, but he wants determination and the <em>heart</em> to go in and
punish his opponent when an opportunity presents itself, many of which
Bailey gave him, but they were not taken advantage of. We heard him
declare that he had received orders to fight cautiously, but his frequent
“dropping” at close quarters cannot, notwithstanding his instructions, be
considered commendable. Had the fight been continued, we have no doubt
Bailey must have been defeated, although his courage might have protracted
the battle for a much longer time, for in each succeeding round he was
receiving punishment without returning it with any visible effect. Ward’s
left hand was puffed, which, with the exception of the slight cut over the
eye, was all the injury he appeared to have met with, while the frontispiece
of his opponent was very much disfigured by the continual jobs from
Ward’s left hand.</p>

<p>The majority of the spectators left Woking by the three o’clock train,
and were conveyed to town, a distance of 33 miles, in about two minutes
over the hour.</p>

<p>This affair was followed by another match, and a deposit of £10; but
at the second deposit at Peter Crawley’s, on the 14th January, 1840,
Ward was announced as “too unwell to fight,” and the stakes down were
handed over to Bailey, at Mrs. Owen’s, Belgrave Mews, on the succeeding
Tuesday; Bailey on the occasion proposing a match with Deaf Burke,
which “ended in smoke.”</p>

<p>In May, Nick Ward was matched for £50 with Brassey, of Bradford,
but this also went off in a refusal on the part of Brassey’s friends to allow
their man to fight for less than £100.</p>

<p>At length, in July, the long-talked-of tourney between Nick and the
Deaf’un took shape and substance, and £50 were down, to be made £100,
for the men to meet on the 22nd of September, 1840, over 50 and under
100 miles from London. To that day we shall, therefore, come, without
further preface.</p>

<p>“Thayre you air agin,” as Paddy said to the pig in his potato-trench&mdash;&#8203;and
sure enough “thayre we were, body and bones,” on Tuesday, September
22nd, in the self-same field, on the borders of Oxfordshire, in which Isaac
Dobell (lately defunct) whacked his friend Bailey the butcher, on the
7th of April, 1828; and we can only regret that in modern times we have not
had more frequent opportunities of witnessing those manly demonstrations
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pageno">219</span>
of “fair play” which the sports of the Ring are so admirably
calculated to afford. But how did you get there? Why, to tell
the truth, as far as we were personally concerned, with tolerable ease&mdash;&#8203;although
not without incurring divers dangers by “flood and field”&mdash;&#8203;<em>bekase</em>
the Commissary had kindly engaged us a postchaise; and we regret that
many of our friends were not equally fortunate. To be plain&mdash;&#8203;the fight
was fixed to come off within sixty, and above fifty miles from London, on
the Liverpool line, and hence the Deaf’un, who won the toss for choice
of ground, named Wolverton, the first “grubbing bazaar” on the Birmingham
railway (about fifty-one miles from the Euston Square station), as
the point of rendezvous. Thither, on the day before, the Commissary and
his deputy (Tom Oliver and Jack Clarke) repaired with their <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">materiel</span>, and
it was ascertained that “the Deaf’un and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>” had taken up their quarters
at the “Bull,” at Stony Stratford, while “Nick Ward and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>” were
domiciled in a village not far distant.</p>

<p>The morning broke most inauspiciously, and heavy showers damped the
ardour of many a boxing patron, who, instead of advancing to Buckinghamshire,
quietly sojourned in <i>Bedfordshire</i>. Still, there was a fair “turn
out” of spicy dare-devils, who were not to be scared by trifles from their
favourite pastime, hence the morning trains took down a moderate sprinkling
of “the right sort.” On reaching Wolverton, however, great was
their dismay at finding that there were but two postchaises at that station&mdash;&#8203;both
of which had been pre-engaged&mdash;&#8203;and that of other vehicles there
was a similar scarcity. Scouts were sent to Stony Stratford, but in vain;
for the few that were there had already been secured by the early birds,
and thus “a pilgrimage through the Slough of Despond” stared them in
the face. Poor Stony Stratford is, alas! not what it was before railroads
were in fashion. It is reduced to a mere sleepy, out-of-the-way village,
instead of being as, in our time, a centre of bustle and prosperity: indeed,
in recent memory it was the high and popular road to Birmingham, distinguished
by the number of mails and stage-coaches which “changed”
there, and the continuous demand for post-horses. Alas! “The Cock,”
the sign of its principal inn, has ceased to “crow,” and the host, like Dennis
Bulgruddery, often calls in vain upon his ostler Dan, to know “if he
sees a customer coming that way?” Happily, Tuesday’s call enabled Dan
to respond&mdash;&#8203;not that there was a customer coming, but many, and thus the
ordinary gloom of every-day melancholy was roused into cheerfulness and
hope. All the nags were soon engaged, and “the Cock” without and
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pageno">220</span>
“the cocks” within chuckled with satisfaction. The “Bull,” at which
the Burkites were assembled, also became rampant, and “sich a gittin up
stairs” had not been witnessed for months.</p>

<p>As the day advanced the bells of the parish church rang a merry peal,
“set a-going,” as the facetious Jem Burn said, “in honour of the occasion;”
but, as we afterwards learnt, with the double intent of announcing
a couple of village weddings. By a singular combination, the face of the
clock of the said parish church, in gilt letters, forewarned the travellers of
the fact that it was either the handiwork of “<i>T. Oliver</i> and <i>J. Clarke</i>” or
had been erected or repaired during the official service of churchwardens
bearing those popular names; a fact which produced on the “dials” of
the venerable Commissary and his deputy, as they waited for orders, a grin
of scarcely repressible self-sufficiency. The “office” was duly given as to
“the where,” and away went the Commissary and his pioneers to Deanshanger,
about four miles distant, in the county of Bucks, followed by a
goodly multitude, horse and foot, embracing a large proportion of
British yeomen, to whom the dripping weather gave a timely relief from
the labours of the field. On reaching Deanshanger, however, the fact of
a couple of mounted “rural blues” being abroad rendered it prudent to
move on, and hence the arena was finally formed at Lillingstone Level,
on the estate of Colonel Delappe, on the borders of Oxfordshire; the
journey to which locality, “through the woods and through the woods,”
was trying alike to man and horse. In truth, a more heathenish road
never was travelled since the times of the Druids; nor ever did the modern
invention of springs undergo a more severe ordeal, while the be-bogged
pedestrian railed with bitter inveteracy against the railroads which had
subjected them to such unforeseen difficulties, by causing a dearth of the
ordinary modes of “civilised conveyance.” However, “barring all pother,”
we at length reached our final destination, and there found the lists in
fitting preparation.</p>

<p>It was now nearly one o’clock, and all was completed; but, as might
have been said to the mob who surrounded Tyburn tree, awaiting the
arrival of Jack Sheppard, “there’s no fun till the principals arrive,” so
here there was no fun till Ward presented his agreeable mug. It is true
that the Deaf’un shied his castor into the ring before one, and claimed
forfeit in consequence of the absence of “Young” not “<i>Old Nick</i>;” but
as the appointed ground had been changed, and Ward and his friends had
to scramble through the bogs with the assistance only of a one-horse
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pageno">221</span>
cart, sufficient excuse was afforded for his absence, and the claim was
premature.</p>

<p>At last the signal of approach was given, and hailed with satisfaction.
At a quarter past one Ward was on the ground, and the Deaf’un, who had
retired to his drag, was handed forth amidst loud cheers.</p>

<p>Now came “the tug of war.” The belligerents entered the ring in high
spirits, the Deaf’un attended by Harry Preston and Sutton, the pedestrian;
Nick Ward by Dick Curtis and Levi Eckersley. They shook hands
with mutual good will, and having tied their <em>fogles</em> to the stake (blue and
white spot for Nick, and fancy white and green for Burke), they tossed
for choice of corners, which was won by the Deaf’un. Each immediately
proceeded to his toilette, and, “in the wringing off of a door-knocker,”
was prepared for action. This was at twenty-five minutes to two, and as
the rain had ceased, a “comfortable mill” was anticipated by a vast multitude,
horse and foot, which surrounded the magic circle, and which was
every moment swelling from fresh arrivals through cross-country paths.</p>

<p>On presenting themselves at the scratch the fronts of the heroes were
duly scanned and criticised. Burke, for an old ’un, who had contended in
seventeen prize battles, of which he had won fifteen and lost but two,
looked remarkably well. His condition was quite up to the mark, and
easy confidence sat proudly on his veteran phiz. His ample muscle was
finely developed, and his weight was close upon 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> His nether
extremities were clothed in a pair of drawers, composed of green and white,
the combined remnants of bygone uniforms in which he had figured as
the victor. Nick Ward was also in beautiful condition, and, in appearance,
was all his friends could desire. His weight was about 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, and he
had the advantage in height and length, as well as youth and freshness,
over his opponent. Burke was born in December, 1809, and Ward in
April, 1813, so that there was nearly four years’ difference between them.
Previous to setting-to the current odds were 6 and 7 to 4 on Ward; but
2 to 1 had been laid, and his friends booked success as certain.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un came up smiling,
and Ward quiet, but serious. After a good
deal of dodging, in which neither seemed inclined
to commence, Nick tried his left, but
was neatly stopped. Burke had evidently
made up his mind to the “waiting game,”
foreseeing that if he “led off,” the long left-handed
prop of Nick, which was always
ready, would be inconvenient to his frontispiece.
Ward seemed as little inclined to go
to close quarters, but again tried his left,
which was again stopped. In the third
attempt he touched the Deaf’un slightly on
the cheek. Again did the Deaf’un stop the
left, and Ward, putting his hands down,
looked as if he would if he could, while the
Deaf’un, following his example, grinned and
exclaimed “It won’t do, Nick.” Into position
<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><span class="pageno">222</span>
again, but Nick extremely cautious, and
evidently not desirous of close quarters.
Burke beckoned him to come, but the hint
was more civil than welcome. Nick let fly
with his left, but the Deaf’un caught it on
his elbow. More hitting and stopping, when
Nick crept in and let fly with his left, but
was admirably countered. Nick’s knuckles,
however, reached home first, and a slight
tinge of blood was visible on the Deaf’un’s
left cheek (first blood for Ward). The mark
of the counter-hit of Burke also became apparent
on Nick’s left cheek, and this was
“trick and tie.” Again did they counter-hit
with the left, and the Deaf’un showed blood
from his mouth. Ward put his hands down
again, and they looked at each other with
patience. Burke clearly determined not to
play Nick’s game, but to wait for his onslaught.
Nick recommenced his manœuvring,
but found the Deaf’un so well covered
that he dared not try it, and he dodged about
as before, trying the patience of the spectators,
who repeatedly cried, “Go in and
fight” Out went his left, but Burke stopped
it neatly. Nick drew back, and the Deaf’un
amused the folks with a few of his “hankey
pankey” antics, and shaking his head, exclaimed,
“’Twon’t do dis time, Nicks.” Long
sparring; Nick hit short, and the Deaf’un
popped his thumb to his nose. Curtis called
on Nick to shoot with his left, but it was no
go, and the Deaf’un, who can hear when he
likes, cried out, “You knows all about it
betters as we can tell you.” The Deaf’un
stole a march and popped in his left on Nick’s
cheek (cries of “Bravo, Deaf’un!” from his
friends). Long pauses and mutual stopping.
(Twenty-three minutes had expired, but no
mischief done; Jem Burn called for a pillow,
and Tommy Roundhead told the Deaf’un
he had ordered a leg of mutton to be ready
by eleven at night.) Nick at last nailed
the Deaf’un on the jaw with his left and got
away (cheers for Nick). A jackdaw, which
flew close over the ring several times, now
relieved the monotony of the sport, but on
seeing his big brother, Molyneux, he cut it.
Mutual stopping and waiting, but no business
done. The Deaf’un put in his right on
the body, and at last they got to a rally;
heavy hits were exchanged, and the Deaf’un
closed for in-fighting; but Nick fell, the
Deaf’un on him. (This round lasted thirty-seven
minutes, and excited general displeasure,
from its want of animation.)</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Both men showed marks of pepper
from the close contact in the last round.
Burke bled from the mouth, and Ward a
little from the ear; but there was no real
mischief done. Again did Burke wait and
Ward stand off, still disinclined for close
quarters. “Why don’t you go and fight?”
resounded from all sides. “I’m ready,”
cried the Deaf’un; “why don’t he come?”
Fifty minutes had elapsed. The men approached
and retreated several times, till at
length heavy counters with the left were
exchanged, and away; more dodging. The
Deaf’un crept in and caught Ward under the
left arm with his right; had it been over the
shoulder and reached the ear, it would have
told tales. Jem Ward exclaimed, “The
day’s long enough, take your time, Nick.”
“Ay,” cried the Deaf’un, “it will be long
enough for me to lick him, and you afterwards.”
Nick now got closer, counter-hits
were tried, but stopped; each brought up
his right at the jaw and closed, and the
Deaf’un was disposed to continue his work,
but Ward fell on his knees. The round
lasted twenty minutes, and fifty-seven
minutes had passed away.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Again was the long and tedious system
of waiting adopted. Each dropped his hands,
and Nick scratched his head, and rubbed
his breast, but did anything but go in to
fight, although Dick Curtis assured him the
Deaf’un would “stand it” The Deaf’un
laughed and shook his head, tried his right,
but was short; in a second attempt he was
more successful, and caught Ward on the
jaw, just under the old cheek hit. Ward
looked serious. At last Ward rushed in
left and right; blows were exchanged, but
the round was closed by Ward getting down.
He was clearly playing the safe game of
caution, and had no desire to throw a chance
away. One hour and forty-three minutes
had elapsed.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Cries to Ward of “Go in,” but he was
deaf to the incitement, and “bided his
time;” finally he stole upon the Deaf’un,
hit left and right, and for a moment there
was some tidy in-fighting, and a few exchanges;
in the close the Deaf’un was
down. Nick, we thought, hit open-handed.
On the Deaf’un rising his “bellows heaved,”
and it was clear this long sparring delay was
searching his wind, while his damaged right
leg seemed to get weak from long standing.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un let fly with his right and
caught Ward on the shoulder&mdash;&#8203;well meant,
but too low. Counter-hits with the left,
when Ward planted three left-handed hits
in succession on Burke’s nob. Burke slightly
countered, but was getting slow, and bled
from the mouth and nose. Ward improved
his advantage and again popped in his left
three or four times. The Deaf’un went
wildly to work, but was short with his right,
and his counter-hits with the left did not get
well home. In a scrambling close Ward
was down, and Burke was evidently distressed
and not firm on his pins (4 to 1
offered on Ward).</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Ward, seeing the condition of his man,
determined to improve his advantage&mdash;&#8203;popped
in a left-hander on the Deaf’un’s eyebrow,
which he cut; a rally followed, and good
hits were exchanged; in the close Ward
down. A blow from Ward’s right, below
Burke’s waistband, excited some discontent,
but it was not objected to by the umpire.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Burke stopped Nick’s left, and planted
his right counter-hits with the left, and a
<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pageno">223</span>
smart rally. Nick hit with his hand open, but
the returns were rapid, and in the close
Ward went down.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Both showed punishment, but the
Deaf’un had the balance against him and his
left eye was swollen. A spirited rally,
although wild; the Deaf’un was slow and
short with his right. In the close Ward
fell on his hands and knees. He still continued
to play the careful game.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Burke steadied himself, stopped Nick’s
left with great precision, popping in his
right heavily on Ward’s body. Nick popped
in his left and got to a close; the
Deaf’un fibbed, but Ward soon got down,
the Deaf’un falling by his side.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un hit short with his right,
but Nick planted his left, when the Deaf’un
bored in and fell on his knees&mdash;&#8203;Ward withholding
an intended blow in time.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;(Two hours had now elapsed.) Nick
hit short with his left, and the Deaf’un
nodded. Counter-hits on the masticators.
The Deaf’un planted his right on Nick’s
nose, and drew claret. Nick made play with
his left, and the Deaf’un fell on his knees.
The visit to Nick’s smelling organ seemed
anything but acceptable.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Ward’s proboscis bleeding; but he
seemed not to have lost his spirits, and let
fly his left, which Burke stopped. Heavy
counter-hits with the left, and the Deaf’un
delivered a good body-blow with his right;
Nick in with his left, and went down. It was
now thought to be anybody’s fight, and the
odds were reduced to 6 to 4 on Ward; but still
it was apparent that the Deaf’un was distressed,
while Ward was fresh, and careful
of his corpus.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Nick led off with his left, and followed
the Deaf’un to his corner. The Deaf’un
stood on the defensive, but received two or
three heavy hits right and left. In the close
he fell under the ropes, and Nick also went
down.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Nick saw his man was abroad, and
the moment he was up set to work left and
right. The Deaf’un fought boldly, but was
slow, and had the worst of the punishment;
still he made some good round hits, and
Ward was down.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Nick went to work left and right; the
Deaf’un became groggy, and fought wildly,
missing several blows. Both down, Ward
under.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Nick now saw it was all in his favour:
he hit as he pleased left and right; the
Deaf’un, all abroad, hit wildly. In the
close Ward down, and the Deaf’un on him,
weak.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;The Deaf’un came up quite groggy,
when Ward went to work left and right,
having it all his own way; he drove Burke
against the ropes, upon which he threw
him on his back, and, while in that position,
hit him heavily with his right till he
fell over; cries of “<em>foul!</em>” here burst
from the Deaf’un’s friends, in which others
joined, and a general rush was made to
the ring, overturning all those who sat
close to it, including ourselves. The
umpires disagreed, of course, but not
being close to the referee, had to go
round to him: pending this, Nick Ward
stood up in the ring, while the Deaf’un was
picked up and seated on Sutton’s knee. At
last the referee was reached, and on being
appealed to, pronounced, as he was justified
in doing, “fair.” It was said “time” was
then called, although, from our position,
involved in a crush, we did not hear it.
The hat was immediately thrown up, and
the battle was claimed for Ward. (We
ought to state that during the last four or
five rounds there was a tremendous fall of
hail and rain.)</p>

<p>     Subsequent to the termination of the 17th
round, and previous to the referee giving
his judgment, it was stated that while Deaf
Burke was seated on his second’s knee Nick
Ward went up to him and struck him twice
or thrice in the face, and also struck Preston,
and subsequently there was a battle
raging between him and Preston, and then
between Preston and Jem Ward, close to the
referee. We have been further informed
that if “time” was called, Burke refused to
prolong the fight, alleging that Ward had
struck him “foul” while on his second’s
knee, and before the decision on the previous
question had been given. With respect
to all this, we confess we are unable
to give an opinion; because we saw no part
of it, being glad to escape from the overwhelming
mass by which we were overborne.
Our impression at the time was that the decision
of the referee was conclusive, and that
Burke was unable to come again, although,
from the time occupied in the discussion, it
is not improbable he might have recovered
his wind and have once more met his man;
still, in our opinion, with very little chance
of turning the scale in his favour; but there
is no calculating on the chapter of accidents.
Ward walked from the ring in full vigour,
and was seen walking about little the worse
for wear, beyond the closure of his left eye,
and we believe he would have seconded
Corbett in the next fight had it been permitted.
The Deaf’un was conducted to his
carriage, and, like Ward, on recovering his
wind was not materially damaged. He contended
he was entitled to the stakes from
Ward’s alleged foul conduct. Ward was so
elated that he boldly challenged the winner
of the coming great fight between Caunt
and Brassey for £100&mdash;&#8203;a challenge in which
his brother Jem heartily joined.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;We must say that in this
battle Burke exceeded our expectations&mdash;&#8203;his
condition was far superior to that in
which he fought Bendigo, and his style of
fighting was excellent. He no longer gave
his head as heretofore, but got it well out
of mischief, and stopped beautifully, until
exhausted by the protracted character of
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pageno">224</span>
Ward’s tactics, and the failure of his knee,
on which he could not be persuaded to wear
a cap, when he became slow, and was fatally
exposed to Ward’s rapid and severe deliveries
with his left. He fought manfully, and
with no more than proper caution, and had
Ward been disposed, would have joined
issue in the first round. Ward, however,
evidently fought to orders; both he and his
friends knew that while Burke’s vigour was
undiminished close contact was dangerous;
and Ward has a very strong antipathy to
punishment which can be avoided. This he
showed, not only from his so long stopping
out, but by his getting down at the end of
the early rounds. The moment he saw he
had got the Deaf’un safe, he threw off all
reserve, and his youth, quickness, and
vigour enabled him to gain an easy victory,
which the increasing slowness and wildness
of the Deaf’un rendered more certain. Of
his courage, however, we cannot say much&mdash;&#8203;he
wants “that within which passeth
show,” and will never make “a kill-devil.”</p>
</div><!--end fight-->

<p>The very next day the following notice was served upon the stakeholder:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p>“I do hereby give you notice not to deliver up the stakes to the opposite party in the
fight between me and Nick Ward, as I hereby claim the same from having received foul
blows from my opponent, Nick Ward, while on my second’s knee, and before ‘Time’ was
called. One of the umpires bears evidence that the last statement is correct, as a friend of
the other umpire (Nick Ward’s) had taken away the only watch used for time-keeping,
while he and my second, Harry Preston, were appealing to the referee with respect to a
prior foul blow. My reason for entering the protest is in order that a meeting may be
obtained with the referee and an appointed number of friends of each party, so that a proper
and just arbitration may be obtained. I shall be prepared at that meeting to produce affidavits
in confirmation of what I assert. My backers hold you liable for the amount of the
stakes.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Nick Ward and Burke.</span>&mdash;&#8203;I hereby declare that no ‘Time’ was called after the appeal
to the referee.”</p>
</div><!--end notice-->

<p>Thus it would seem that this affair came to a wrangle, one of the misfortunes
which arise from the headstrong folly with which the surrounding
spectators rush to the ring the moment a dispute arises. Had they kept
their places, nothing could have been more simple than the issue. The
umpires disagreeing, the referee would at once have said “fair” or “foul;”
and in the former, as decidedly must have been the case in this instance,
“time” would have been called, and the men would have fought on, or he
who refused to walk to the scratch would have lost the battle. But now
comes a new position, all owing to the irregularity described, and of which
we are persuaded neither the umpires nor referee had any knowledge
whatever, except from hearsay. The obtrusion of any person within the
ring, or close to the ring, until the fight shall have been fairly decided, is
obviously wrong, and its mischief is here clearly demonstrated. The
matter was now hedged round with difficulty, the decision of which could
only be given by the appointed referee, and as he could not see the act
complained of, his judgment was founded on the evidence submitted to him.
</p>
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pageno">225</span>

<p>This decision quickly came, and was in favour of Ward, to whom the
stakes were duly paid over.</p>

<p>Ward was now at the top of the tree, and confidence in his powers
seemed to have come with victory. After sundry cartels and haggling
about preliminaries, Caunt having defeated Brassey in October, Nick
challenged Caunt for the honour of the title of “Champion.” Ben responded,
nothing loth, and the subjoined articles were formulated by “the
high contracting plenipotentaries”:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Articles of Agreement entered into this 8th day of December, 1840,
between Benjamin Caunt and Nicholas Ward&mdash;&#8203;The said Ben Caunt
agrees to fight the said Nick Ward, a fair stand-up fight, in a four-and-twenty
foot roped ring, half minute time, within sixty miles of London, on
Tuesday, the 2nd of February, 1841, for £100 a side, according to the
provisions of the new rules. In pursuance of this agreement, £20 a side
are now deposited; a second deposit of £10 a side to be made on Thursday,
the 17th of December, at Young Dutch Sam’s; a third deposit of £10 a
side on Monday, the 21st of December, at Peter Crawley’s; a fourth
deposit of £10 a side, on Thursday, the 31st of December, at Jem Ward’s,
Liverpool; a fifth deposit of £10 a side, on Friday, the 8th of January,
1841, at Owen Swift’s; a sixth deposit of £10 a side, on Thursday, the 14th
of January, at Young Dutch Sam’s; a seventh deposit of £10 a side, on
Monday, the 18th of January, at Peter Crawley’s; and the eighth and last
deposit of £10 a side, on Thursday, the 28th of January, at the same
house: the said deposits to be made between the hours of eight and ten in
the evening, or the party failing to forfeit the money down. The choice
of place to be decided at the last deposit by toss. The men to be in the
ring between the hours of twelve and one o’clock, or the party absent to
forfeit the battle-money, unless an earlier hour shall be mutually agreed
upon at the last deposit, to which hour the same forfeiture shall be applicable.
Two umpires and a referee to be chosen on the ground; in case of
dispute the decision of the latter to be conclusive. Should magisterial
interference take place, the stakeholder to name the next time and place of
meeting, if possible on the same day. The use of resin or other powder to
the hands during the battle to be considered foul, and the money not to
be given up till fairly won or lost by a fight.</p>

<p class="pneg flushright r1">“Signed&mdash;&#8203;for Caunt&mdash;&#8203;<span class="sc">Peter Crawley</span>.</p>
<p class="pneg flushright r1">“<abbr title="ditto">Do.</abbr>, for Ward&mdash;&#8203;<span class="sc">Samuel Evans</span>.”</p>

<p>On the 23rd of February, then, this anxiously anticipated meeting took
<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">226</span>
place, but resulted in a manner anything but satisfactory to the admirers
of manly pugilism.</p>

<p>On the match being made, the men were quickly in training, Caunt under
the wing of Peter Crawley, at Hatfield, near Barnet, and Nick Ward
under the able supervision of Peter Taylor, near Liverpool. In point of
condition there was no fault to be found; both were perfectly up to the
mark, and in all respects judiciously prepared for their coming struggle.</p>

<p>According to the articles it was provided that the combat should take
place within 60 miles of London. The choice of place was to be decided
by toss, and this was won by the backer of Caunt, who named the vicinity
of the Andover Road Station, on the Southampton Railway, as the place
of meeting; thus imposing upon Nick Ward and his friends the necessity
of coming a distance of upwards of 270 miles, after the Saturday morning,
on which day only they could receive notice of the fixture. This circumstance
produced a good deal of sore feeling among the Ward-ites, and on
the morning of battle led to some angry expressions. We certainly think
that the laws of “give and take” should have been observed in this instance,
and that it was anything but considerate to have imposed so long a journey
upon an honourable opponent. We believe that the selection rather arose
from a desire to give “a turn” to the folks of Hampshire, than from any
wish to take an unfair advantage of Ward. How this love of the “Hampshire
hogs” was returned the vicissitudes hereafter described will show.</p>

<p>On the Sunday, Caunt and Hammer Lane, who were to exhibit in the
same ring, arrived at the “Vine,” at Stockbridge, about ten miles from the
Winchester Station, where they were joined by a select circle of their
backers and friends, and on the day following Nick Ward and Sullivan
(the opponent of Hammer Lane) reached the Andover Road Station,
accompanied by Jem Ward, Peter Taylor, and other friends and admirers,
to the great comfort of the railway officials, who obtained on that and the
succeeding day a profitable accession of passengers. The owners of the
houses of entertainment in the neighbourhood were not less delighted, but
many, from the want of accommodation, proceeded to Winchester, where their
patronage was equally acceptable. On Monday evening it was ascertained
beyond a doubt that the “Hampshire hogs” were as stubborn as some of
their namesakes in other counties, and the hostility of the beaks to the
manly demonstrations of fair play in the Prize Ring was grunted forth by
sundry official leaders of the rural police, by whom, however, it is due to
say, every courtesy consistent with their situation was displayed. This
<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pageno">227</span>
fact created additional unpopularity towards the original author of the
disappointment, who was not less mortified than his grumbling opponents.
There was no help for it, however, and in the evening it was agreed that
both parties should meet the next morning at the village of Sutton, about
four miles from the station, there to determine on the line of march. The
Caunt-ites having ascertained that the affair might come off without interruption
in the county of Wilts, proposed an adjournment in that direction;
but as this step would have carried the Ward-ites some 14 or 15 miles
beyond the stipulated distance of 60 miles from London, they peremptorily
refused to budge an inch across the limit laid down in the articles, and
the road back towards London was the only direction in which they would
consent to proceed. This was the state of things on Monday evening, and
on Tuesday morning, at half-past ten, the village of Sutton displayed a
dense congregation of all classes, from the high-titled nob to the wooden-soled
chawbacon. Carriages of all sorts, from Winchester, Andover,
Stockbridge, Odiham, and all the surrounding post-towns, as well as from
London and elsewhere, were huddled together in tangled confusion,
anxiously waiting to receive the authorised “office” as to the road they
should take. Among these the Commissary, in a light chaise cart, with
the indispensable <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">materiel</span> of his calling, occupied a prominent position,
while the belligerents in their respective drags patiently waited the order
for advance. Amidst the turmoil, the superintendent and the inspectors of
the rural police, attended by a number of constables, some on horseback
and some in chaise carts, were preparing to do their duty, and to see the
expectant multitude fairly out of their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>A council of war having been held at the head inn, Crookham Common,
on the borders of Berkshire, and within three and a half miles of Newbury,
was finally agreed upon as the scene of action, a distance of upwards of sixteen
miles, through a country not very agreeably distinguished by a succession
of steep hills, the ascent and descent of which tended not a little
to retard the speed of the travellers, and still more to try the mettle of
the nags upon whom this additional labour was imposed, while hundreds
of the ten-toed amateurs were altogether thrown out of the sport. At
Whitchurch the inhabitants were rather astonished at the sudden incursion
of the cavalcade. Here there was a general halt for refreshment for man
and beast, and, most ominously, the carriage in which Hammer Lane was
placed broke down; an unfortunate fracture which was imitated by many
other vehicles, which, for this particular occasion, had been drawn from
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pageno">228</span>
a retirement that previous wear and tear had led their owners to consider
perpetual. After a short time “forward” was again the order of the
day, and King’s Clere was reached in due course. Here was another halt,
indispensable to men and cattle, and many of the jaded horses were for a
time placed in stables, while the bonifaces received ample proofs of the
beneficial effects resulting to the human appetite when whetted against the
rough edge of a hard frost and a bracing atmosphere. It was now ascertained
that the “land of promise” was within three miles of the village,
and the Commissary was sent forward to make the necessary preparations
for action, while the horses of the police, sharing the fate of their companions,
were so knocked up that their masters determined to perform the
rest of their journey to the verge of the county on foot, heartily sick of the
ungracious office assigned them. In half an hour the general body made
their final move, and, crossing the river Enborne, at last made their exit
from the inhospitable county of Hants, and luckily sustained no further
impediment. They reached the battle-field on Crookham Common about
half-past three, quickly forming a spacious circle round the ring, which had
been admirably prepared by the commissariat department. The ground
was thinly covered with snow, and was as hard as adamant from the intensity
of the frost, while a cutting breeze from the east, sweeping over the
elevation on which the common is placed, left little ground of regret
among those whose customary visits to their barbers had been neglected
from the rapidity of their morning movements, as they were shaved free of
cost. The assemblage, if not as numerous as might have been anticipated
had not the move taken place, was in the honest sense of the word respectable,
and many persons of <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</span> distinction, both as to rank and station
in society, studded the lively circle.</p>

<p>The umpires having been chosen, the difficulty of selecting a referee
was presented in the same unpleasant aspect as in the then recent fight
between Hannan and Broome,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_23" id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span>
but was at length got over, after a considerable
argumentation, in the selection of a gentleman who, if not professionally
engaged in the business of the Ring, was fully competent to decide
any dispute which might arise, and who certainly discharged the duties of
his unpleasant office with becoming firmness and determination, and, we
must add, with perfect impartiality.</p>

<p>All being now prepared for combat, the men entered the ring, greeted
<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pageno">229</span>
by the cheers of their friends. Caunt came forward, attended by Tass
Parker and Johnny Broome, all sporting their “yellow men,” while Nick
Ward made his bow under the friendly introduction of Dick Curtis and
Harry Holt, each of whom displayed a fogle of blue and white spots.
The men instantly advanced, and shook hands with apparent good-humour,
Ward looked rather serious, while Caunt exhibited a nonchalance and
gaiety which proved that he regarded the coming engagement with anything
but personal apprehension. The betting round the ring at this
moment was 5 to 4 on Caunt, with ready takers; and the preliminaries
having been fully adjusted, the joust commenced.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On getting into position, the
scientific manner in which Ward presented
himself, with his arms well up, prepared to
stop with his right and shoot with his left,
gave evident tokens of his being an accomplished
member of the scientific school.
Caunt also held his arms well up, but with
a degree of awkwardness anything but calculated
to lead the spectators to assume that
he had taken his degree as a “Master of
Arts.” He had evidently made up his mind
to lose no time in commencing operations;
he advanced upon his man, while Ward
stepped back; Caunt, after a flourish or two
of his mawleys, let fly with his left, but was
stopped; Ward in return popped in his left
and right slightly, and after a wild rally, in
which neither hit with precision, and in
which some slight returns were made, Ward’s
left creating a blushing tinge on the big’un’s
cheek, they closed, when Ward dropped,
evidently disinclined to luxuriate in the embrace
of his opponent.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Again the big ’un came up ripe for
mischief, and made play left and right, but
was neatly stopped; Ward then popped in
his left, catching his antagonist on the nose;
both then fought merrily left and right, but
there a want of precision in Ward’s deliveries,
his left passing the head of Caunt
like “the idle wind,” and from the slippery
state of the ground it was obvious that
neither could obtain firm footing. Nick,
however, contrived to plant two or three
left-handed pops, and the round concluded
by both slipping down. (Loud and encouraging
shouts for Ward, whose friends
seemed to deem it necessary to cheer him
on to hopes of victory.)</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Ward came up steady, prepared for
the stop or the shoot. He waited for the
attack, which was soon commenced by Caunt
with vigorous but wild determination. He
stopped left and right, but in his returns
was short, his visitations not reaching their
intended point of contact. Both in fact
missed their blows, and no real mischief
was done. Caunt rushed to a close, but
Ward, still resolved to foil the grappling propensity
of his opponent, slipped down.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt came up resolved to do, but
wild and awkward in his mode of attack.
Nick waited for him, his left ready to pop.
Caunt hit out with his left, but missed, and
Nick in the return was out of distance.
Counter-hitting with the left. Both stopped
intended visitations. Heavy exchanges left
and right, in which Caunt caught a stinger
on the forehead and the nose, from the former
of which blood was drawn, and declared
for Ward amidst deafening shouts and exclamations
of “It’s all your own!” A wild
rally followed, in which Caunt caught Ward
a crack on the nob with his right. In the
close Caunt caught Ward in his arms, but
he again went down.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt tried a feint to draw his man,
but Nick was too leary. He preserved his
own position, evidently determined to nail
his man with the left on coming in. Caunt,
impatient, hit out wildly left and right,
Nick broke ground and got away. On
again getting to work Nick planted his left
on Caunt’s eye, slight exchanges followed,
but no serious impression was made, and
Ward’s left passed over Caunt’s shoulder.
In Caunt’s deliveries there was neither
force nor accuracy. Ward getting nearer
his man succeeded in planting a rap on his
proboscis. Caunt instantly seized him in
his arms and was about to fib, when Ward endeavoured
to get down, but the big ’un held
him too firmly, and fell heavily upon him.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;On coming up Caunt exhibited symptoms
of visitations to his nose and eye, as
well as to his forehead, but still no material
damage had been effected. Ward led off
with his left, but the hit was short, and was
attended with little effect. Caunt again
closed, determined to give his man the
benefit of a Nottinghamshire hug, but Ward
frustrated his intention by dropping on his
<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pageno">230</span>
knees. At the moment Caunt, determined
to give him a compliment as he fell, let fly
his right, which did not reach its destination
(Ward’s lug) till Ward’s knees had
actually reached the ground. (There was
an immediate cry of “foul!” and the partisans
of Ward, as well as his second, rushed
to the referee to claim the battle. This
was decidedly in opposition to the new rules,
which prescribe that all such appeals shall
be made to the umpires, and by them
to the referee, and that no other person
whatever shall presume to interfere.
Amidst the turmoil and confusion of
intimidation the referee remained silent
until the umpires declared they disagreed,
and when the question was then put to him
deliberately pronounced “fair,” believing, as
he said he did, that the blow was unintentional,
and had commenced its flight before
Ward was actually on the ground. All cavil
was now at an end, and the fight proceeded;
the friends of Caunt earnestly entreating that
he would be cautious of what he was about,
and be particularly careful in avoiding the
repetition of the blow, which the falling
system of Ward might unintentionally lead
him to administer.)</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Caunt came up as fresh as a sucking
bull, and pregnant with deeds of mischief.
Ward waited for him steadily, and
let fly his left, catching Caunt slightly
on the mug. Caunt hit wildly left and
right, but missed; he then closed, again
catching Ward in his forceps. Ward, however,
renewed his dropping system, and
slipped from between his arms on his knees,
his hands up. While in this position,
evidently down, Caunt instantaneously
drew back his right hand, and hit him twice
on the side of the head. The shout of
“Foul!” was immediately renewed with
redoubled ardour, and a simultaneous appeal
was again made to the referee by some
dozen persons who crowded round him, all
vociferously demanding confirmation of their
own impressions. This indecorous and disgraceful
dictation was again manfully resisted
by the referee, who, waiting with
firmness till calmness was restored, listened
to the appeal from the proper authorities,
and pronounced the last blows to be “foul;”
observing that Ward was clearly down upon
both knees when the blows were delivered.
Shouts of congratulation forthwith hailed
Ward as the conqueror; a result which filled
him with delight: and he quitted the ring
with joyous satisfaction, scarcely exhibiting
a mark of the conflict in which he had been
engaged. Indeed of punishment he did not
afford a specimen worth mentioning. The
fight lasted but twelve minutes, and terminated
at three minutes after four o’clock.</p>

<p>     The backer of Caunt was naturally irritated
at this disappointment of his hopes,
and, sustained by the authority of an old
ring-goer, contended that the decision of the
referee, however honourably given, was in
opposition to the rules of the Ring, for that
by those rules it was provided, that it was
necessary a man should have his hand on
the ground, as well as both knees, before a
blow given could be pronounced foul; and
in this persuasion he said he should give
notice to the stakeholder not to part with
the stakes or the bets till the point was deliberately
settled. The referee said he had
given his decision with perfect impartiality,
and he believed with perfect justice. In
confirmation of which he turned to a copy
of <cite>Fistiana</cite>, which he had in his possession,
and quoted from thence (page 29) the 7th at
Broughton’s Rules, which provides, “That
no person is to hit his adversary when he is
down, or seize him by the ham, the breeches,
or any part below the waist; a man on his
knees to be reckoned down.” He then quoted
the 14th of the New Rules of the Ring (page
65), which provides, in the same spirit, “That
a blow struck when a man is thrown, or
down, shall be deemed foul. That a man
with one hand and one knee on the
ground, or with both knees on the ground,
shall be deemed down; and a blow given in
either of these positions shall be considered
foul; providing always, that when in such
position, the man so down shall not
strike, or attempt to strike.” The articles
having been framed according to the New
Rules, this reference must be conclusive. It
was contended, that in the battle between
Tom Belcher and Dutch Sam, the Pugilistic
Club had decided that a blow given when a
man was on his knees, with both hands up,
was not foul; but, as there was no written
record of this decision, and as it is opposed
both to Broughton’s Rules and the New
Rules, the argument can have no weight,
and the stakes, however easily and unsatisfactorily
won, were of right given to Ward.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Ward, in purchasing this
almost bloodless victory, did not add much
to his reputation. That he was entitled to
the reward of conquest cannot be denied;
but the opportunities of testing his improved
qualities and courage were so limited, that
it would be worse than hypocrisy to say he
offered any peculiar claims to high praise.
That he is more scientific than his opponent
cannot be doubted; but it must be admitted
that on comparing his tactics with the steady
and cutting precision of his brother Jem, he
has yet much to learn. Many of his blows
were short, while others, well-intentioned,
missed their aim&mdash;&#8203;a circumstance probably
to be ascribed to the slippery state of the
ground, and the unsteady manœuvres of his
opponent. Whether, if the fight had been
prolonged, he would have improved upon
acquaintance, we cannot foresee. Regarding
his courage, no particular exception can be
taken, for although going down or trying to
go down in every round is unsightly in the
eyes of the spectators, and has the semblance
of being opposed to the commonplace notions
of a fair stand-up fight, yet, according to the
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pageno">231</span>
12th of the New Rules, it will be seen that
such an expedient is allowable; that rule
provides “that it shall be a fair stand-up
fight; and if either man shall wilfully throw
himself down without receiving a blow, he
shall be deemed to have lost the battle: but
this rule shall not apply to a man who in a
close slips down from the grasp of his opponent
to avoid punishment.” Here blows
had been exchanged, and Ward obviously
slipped down to avoid the punishment which
Caunt had determined to administer. Moreover,
it was to avoid the hugging end being
borne on to the ropes which Ward evaded
by slipping from the intended embrace.
With regard to Caunt, we attribute the loss
of the battle to his uncontrollable impetuosity.
That he would have been defeated in
fair fight by his accomplished antagonist is
by no means a settled point, for although
he showed marks of tapping, he was quite as
fresh and vigorous as when he commenced,
and was quite as likely to win in the last as
he was in the first round. He has still, however,
much to learn; he wants steadiness
and precision, and the wildness with which
he hits defeats his own object. In the use
of his left, as well as in stopping, he has certainly
improved, and we think, as his experience
increases, he may become a greater
adept in the art. He must learn to curb his
impetuosity, and preserve that presence of
mind the absence of which so speedily led to
the downfall of his hopes in this case. So
persuaded was he that he could have won,
that immediately after judgment had been
given against him, he declared he would
make a fresh match, and post the whole
hundred of his own money. It is singular
that in his fights with Bendigo and Brassey
he seldom lost a due command over his temper,
although both these men pursued the
same course of getting down as Ward. With
regard to Brassey, his gift of punishment is
far more severe than that of Ward, as the
evidence of Caunt’s carved frontispiece on
the former occasion sufficiently testified.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="h4head">NATHANIEL LANGHAM.<br />
1843&ndash;1857.</h4>

<p class="p2">“<span class="sc">Take</span> him for all in all,” the subject of this chapter, as a middle-weight,
was “a man” of whom might be safely said “we shall not look
upon his like again.” He was of the weight so often described by the
“old school” as the “unlucky 11 stone; too heavy for the light, and too
light for the heavy ones.” Yet at that weight it is indisputable that the
finest specimens of skill, strength, and activity have been developed, where
courage and endurance have been duly combined, “to give the world
assurance of a man.”</p>

<p>Nathaniel Langham was born in May, 1820, at Hinckley in Leicestershire;
his height 5 feet 10 inches, and weight, as already stated, 11 stone.
Nat’s earlier years were passed as a country labourer’s are usually. In
his boyish days he worked in the fields, and as soon as he was fitted, made
his way into Leicester, where he was engaged by a tradesman, as he himself
has told us, to “deliver goods with a horse and cart.” While in this
town he attained, in the years 1841&ndash;1843, an insight into the more scientific
manœuvres of the art pugilistic, for which he had a natural taste and instinctive
aptitude, being much praised by Dick Cain, who often encouraged
him to “put on the mittens” with rural roughs who might fancy their
fistic abilities, and who gave Nat the best of tactical advice and instruction.
Notwithstanding this episode of town life, it is certain that in February,
1843, Langham was again at his native village of Hinckley, for in <cite>Bell’s
Life</cite> of February 12th we find the following paragraph, recording the
first Ring fight of our hero:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="blockquote">“A fight came off on Thursday last, near Hinckley, Leicestershire,
between Nathaniel Langham, of Hinckley, and William Ellis, of Sabcote
(an adjacent village), for £5 a side. The men were of pretty equal proportions,
<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><span class="pageno">235</span>
each standing a little under six feet, but, if anything, Ellis is the
larger man; he is an old fighter, and was considered by his backers
(though they must now be convinced to the contrary) invincible. Langham,
too, has appeared in the Ring before, and distinguished himself as a
man of no small talent as regards his milling capabilities. The fight took
place about eleven o’clock, when both men went to work hard and fast,
Langham hitting well at his man, and getting his blows home. Ellis was
unable to hit his antagonist with effect, and at the expiration of the eighth
round showed his sense by giving in, having his peepers most effectually
darkened, his lips cut, and other very visible marks of heavy and frequent
visitations from Langham’s skilfully directed ‘fives.’”</p>

<p>Nat after this took his way to the great mart for all rising talent, the
Metropolis, landing at Ben Caunt’s early in 1844. On the 7th of May
in that year Langham found himself one of a pugilistic party, headed by
Ben Caunt, on board of the “Nymph” steamer, outward bound in search of
a convenient battle-field for the settlement of the “difference of opinion”
between Joe Bostock (a former opponent of Johnny Broome) and Turner,
the “Wychwood Forester.” This affair disposed of, by Bostock winning
in thirty-four minutes, a purse was collected for “an afterpiece.” Thereupon
Tom Lowe, a stalwart coal-whipper of some repute as conqueror
in various bye-battles, and who afterwards beat Hurley at 12 stone, presented
himself. Nat proposed to answer the challenger, and “Big Ben”
gave his approval of the experiment. D’Orsay Turner, and Mike Driscoll
seconded Langham, Jack Cullen and Ned Adams picking up Lowe. The
battle was a curious, scrambling affair, according to the meagre paragraph
which is afforded to it in <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>. In fact, it is within our knowledge that
the reporter on this occasion had left the ring and gone aboard the steamer
before it was known that a second fight was arranged. In the 43rd round,
when Lowe was said to have “the best of the battle” (?) we are told, “On
getting up from his corner Lowe, much to the surprise of most parties,
went up to his adversary, and shaking hands with him, declined fighting
any more; Langham was of course proclaimed the victor, after fighting
50 minutes.” We suspect the verbal amateur reporter of this affair did
not know so much about Nat Langham’s capabilities as Mr. Lowe had
found out during the 50 minutes he had faced him. At any rate, Caunt
was so satisfied with his “novice’s” display that he offered to back him for
£25 against any man of his weight. Langham also put forth a challenge
to fight Joe Bostock, the conqueror in this day’s battle, “for £25, to meet
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pageno">236</span>
within six weeks of signing articles;” but Johnny Broome, who was behind
Bostock, and than whom in his day there was no better judge, having
availed himself of an opportunity of trying Nat with the gloves, would not
have the engagement at any price, and so the affair came to nought. A
clear twelvemonth now elapsed before Nat could meet with a customer,
although we find him offering himself as a candidate for pugilistic honours
at 11 stone, and give 7<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, for £25; money ready at “The Lion,” at Hinckley,
or the “Coach and Horses,” <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s Lane.</p>

<p>In the month of June, 1845, Langham being then under the wing of Ben
Caunt, an outsider presented himself at the Champion’s hostelrie, and in
the course of conversation announced himself as “Doctor” Campbell; he
was soon recognised as the successful opponent of Ben Hart, in a punishing
fight of seventy-one rounds, which took place on the 3rd of November,
1842, in the Kentish marshes. A bout with the gloves with “brother
Bob” (certainly no great “trial-horse”) was followed by the “Doctor,”
who weighed close on 12 stone, declaring himself to be “in want of a
job,” whereon Nat suggested to his patron Ben that he thought he could
accommodate the “Doctor” by giving him a few pounds’ weight and a
beating. Ben, who was ever close-fisted, offered to put down a “fiver” for
Nat; and, as the “Doctor’s” friends were not flush of money, that modest
sum remained without increase until the 12th of June, when Big Ben, as
M.C., taking advantage of the hiring of a steamer for a more important
“excursion,” shipped his man Nat, and conveyed him to the battle-field at
Rainham Ferry, at which place “Doctor” Campbell and friends were in
waiting. No contemporary report of the rounds is extant, but we know from
eye-witnesses that Nat, though with small preparation, in the short space of
thirty-five minutes so used his left “pickaxe”&mdash;&#8203;as it was afterwards expressively
termed by no less a master of arts than Tom Sayers himself&mdash;&#8203;that
the “Doctor” was completely “physicked.” In the 27th round he “retired
from professional practice,” entirely disabled, and declined further contest,
and never again showed within the ropes of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr></p>

<p>Dan Hagerty, who had beaten Bill Amos, Jack Johnston, and subsequently
the hard-hitting Aby Durell, was challenged by Nat for £25 a side; but
Dan’s backers, after some conference, thought it best to leave the Leicester
man alone, and a sov. down was forfeited.</p>

<p>Nat now retired into country quarters, and we next hear of him as
matched with a boxer of great local renown, hight George Gutteridge,
of Bourne, in Lincolnshire. Gutteridge, who was born in 1823, stood
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pageno">237</span>
5 feet 9 inches, and weighed 11 stone 7 lbs., began his rising career
in April, 1845, by beating, in 23 sharp rounds, George Graham (known
as the “Potter”); this he followed in June, 1846, by defeating Macdonald,
of Derby (the conqueror of Jem Bailey and several others), in
a slashing fight of thirty-five minutes, in which 31 rattling rounds were
contested. About this time we saw Gutteridge in London, at Caunt’s,
and a more likely young fellow for wear and tear, his pluck being
undoubted, we have seldom seen. His skill as a fighter, like all rural
champions, was, of course, ridiculously overrated; and when Ben pointed
him out to us as “that’s the chap that’s matched against Langham, what
do you think of him?” there was a sort of hesitancy in the Champion’s
tone, that expressed anxious doubt for the safety of the “quarter of a
hundred,” besides “training ex’s,” which he had invested on the “wager of
battle.” Caunt having received £7 from Gutteridge’s friends, for the right
of naming the place of meeting, Mr. Banton’s, New Inn, at Bourne, South
Lincolnshire, was named as the rendezvous, and thither on the overnight
of the battle, Tuesday, June 9th, 1846, Caunt, with Langham and friends,
repaired. At 8 a.m. the men went to scale, Langham drawing 11 stone,
Gutteridge 11 stone 8 lbs. Langham looked thin but hard, as if somewhat
overtrained. Gutteridge showed wonderfully strong, though a trifle fleshy.
An excellent ring was formed at South Farm Pastures, about three miles
from Bourne, and around it was grouped a large attendance of the gentry,
yeomen, farmers, and labourers, with a sprinkling of sporting men from
Leicestershire and the Midlands. The order, good-temper, and we might
say decorum of the assembly, and the conduct of the spectators throughout
the fight, were an example to such gatherings which we despair in these
days to see imitated, either down rail or river. Langham had for his
seconds Dan Bufton and John Gill; Gutteridge was excited on by Homer
Howden and his former antagonist “Potter George” (Graham). The
colours, a canary yellow for Langham, and a blue and white spot for
Gutteridge, being tied to the stakes, the men shook hands cheerfully, and
the battle began, the current odds being 6 and 7 to 4 on Gutteridge.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;The attitude of Nat was by
far the more artistic, though that of the
Lincolnshire man was by no means awkward
or constrained; yet he held his arms
too close and across to deliver at a well-judged
distance; accordingly, after a
little sparring just to feel his way, Nat
popped in a couple of such sharp facers,
jumping back from the return, that the
question of “first blood” was settled almost
in the first hit, the crimson fluid trickling
from Gutteridge’s left optic. The Lincoln
man, who was evidently no flincher, went
in ding-dong, Langham retreating perforce
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><span class="pageno">238</span>
from his determined rush, but delivering
two or three cutting left-handers on his assailant’s
frontispiece before he went down
at the ropes on the saving suit.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Nat came up cool as a cucumber, with
no visible marks of hitting save a red bump
on his left cheek-bone, and a slight flush of
colour which rather improved his complexion.
Gutteridge, on the contrary, had
a gaping cut over the right eye, a prominent
blue mouse under the left optic, and his
teeth were tinged from his cut lip. He
rattled in undismayed, but got little by the
motion, the balance of the exchanges being
all in favour of Leicester. In a close, however,
he gripped Master Nat, and embracing
him, showed his superior strength by forcing
him down and falling on him heavily.
(Cheering for Gutteridge.)</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Nat dodging in, and then retreating, to
get his man to follow. Gutteridge, by advice
of his seconds, refusing to do so, Nat woke
him up by twice visiting his left eye clean
over his guard, whereupon Gutteridge,
stung by these long shots, rushed to close
quarters, and after taking a prop or two
fought Nat down in his own corner. (The
Lincoln man’s friends in high glee.)</p>

<p>     4 to 10.&mdash;&#8203;Langham seemed steady and
cool, and none the worse for Mr. Gutteridge’s
lunges, and the rapid rallies which followed
at close quarters. Not so Gutteridge, whose
portrait was gradually painted in crimson by
a master-hand. Though there was active
fighting on both sides, there was a somewhat
tedious similarity in the rounds, Langham
improving his lead in every bout, and
Gutteridge failing in most cases, in clenching
his adversary for the throw.</p>

<p>     From the 11th to the 50th round Gutteridge
showed himself dangerous, and with
unflinching game every now and then raised
the hopes of his partisans by remaining on
his legs after severe exchanges of blows,
then walking to his corner to seat himself on
his second’s knee, while Nat, husbanding
his strength, was tenderly carried, often
sedan fashion, by his careful attendants to
his appointed resting-place.</p>

<p>     In the 51st round, to the surprise of all,
Langham seemed to recover second wind;
perceiving the shaky state of his brave
opponent, he assumed the offensive, and
delivered half a dozen hits left and right at
arm’s length, the last of which sent down
Gutteridge in his corner all of a heap;
the first fair knock down. From this point
the rounds became short, poor Gutteridge
gradually losing almost every glimpse
of daylight, coming up round after
round until the 93rd, when, perceiving
the last chance of his man had
vanished, Hodgkiss threw up the sponge
in Gutteridge’s corner in token of defeat,
and Nat was hailed the victor of the day,
after a severe contest of <em>one hour and twenty-five
minutes</em> of active and actual fighting;
Langham’s superiority as a boxer being
evident from first to last.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>At the giving up of the stakes at Caunt’s on the following Thursday,
Angelo, of Windsor, was backed against Langham for £50 a side, but the
match went off, Gutteridge’s backer posting a small deposit for a second
encounter, which was covered on the part of Langham, who afterwards
received forfeit, the Lincolnshire friends of the former considering the first
judgment of the referee not likely to be reversed on a new trial.</p>

<p>William Sparkes, a hardy Australian, having fought his way to fame at
the Antipodes, and made the voyage to the Old Country, in further search
of “the bubble reputation,” was introduced in the early part of 1847 to
the London Ring, under the patronage of Johnny Broome, and that ’cute
observer at once commended him to his Corinthian visitors, as “just the
sort of man to polish off Master Nat,” who, in the estimate of Johnny,
“was dangerously clever, but had no constitution.” Sparkes, at this time,
was certainly a fine, hardy specimen of a “corn-stalk” as could be seen in
a summer’s day. Twenty-six years of age, firmly put together, round-limbed,
muscular, and active, and not only bringing with him a belt as a
pugilist, but also a trophy won by his fleetness of foot as a pedestrian
“champion,” he was certainly a “representative man,” so far as Australian
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pageno">239</span>
prowess was in question. With him, then, Langham was matched, as
champion of the honour of the Old Country, for £50 a side, and Tuesday,
May 4th, 1847, was fixed for the final settlement of the question.</p>

<p>On that day, at an early hour, the “Nymph” being chartered for the
voyage, the party embarked from the now-abolished Hungerford Market
Pier, and thence dropped down to Blackwall, where, on the Brunswick
Pier, a goodly muster of the Fancy had assembled, and where, also, a coal-tug
or two, laden with “Cheapside” customers, were in waiting to follow
in the wake of the Fancy “flag-ship.” From some petty jealousy, into the
cause of which we do not care to inquire, Tom Spring, Peter Crawley, and
a group of Corinthians here shipped themselves on board the regular
Gravesend passenger-boat, instead of taking tickets by the chartered
“Fancy” craft. Johnny Broome, who was in command, suppressed any
mortification he might have felt, but did not the less determine to balance
accounts with the Separatists, as the sequel will show. The “Nymph”
cast off from the Blackwall Pier, and led the way towards Charlton, where
Langham was taken on board, having been trained by Robinson (“Caunt’s
Pet”), near Dartford; the Australian had already been shipped at Hungerford.
While we lay-to off Charlton Pier, the Gravesend boat, with the two
crowded tugs in attendance, pursued their downward course. Soon after,
as the “Nymph,” at half-speed, was nearing Erith, Johnny Broome called
“a council of war,” wherein he announced his resolution to disappoint
those who had shown such a want of that unanimity which we had so often
publicly advocated on these occasions. He proposed that we should “about
ship,” and make a return voyage, leaving the “secessionists,” including the
“tuggites” and the Gravesend passengers, to the enjoyment of their excursion,
without the prospect of seeing the day’s mill, from the appointed and
legitimate mode of being present at which they had thus wilfully disentitled
themselves. His arguments were unanswerable. The bow of the
“Nymph” was quickly put up stream, the tide was flowing, and back we
went; indeed, almost before the downward voyagers were aware of our
change of course, we were steaming through the Pool, and thence pursued
our way, never stopping until Nine Elms Pier was reached. There the
men and their friends disembarked, and, availing themselves of a train by
the South Western Railway, proceeded to Woking Common. On arriving,
the Commissary and assistants quickly prepared a ring, on the ground
where Barnash and Martin fought a fortnight previous; and in half an
hour, the party having refreshed themselves meantime at a neighbouring
<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">240</span>
hostelrie, a select party of about one hundred spectators surrounded the
roped enclosure, heartily laughing at “the sell” practised upon the “Secesh,”
who had cut themselves off by their own want of <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit du corps</span> from witnessing
the fight. Among the disappointed were some “knowing ones,”
who, in those days of “pigeon expresses,” had carried down their feathered
messengers, with the view of conveying to their London confederates the
first news of the battle and its result.</p>

<p>At half-past two o’clock the combatants entered the lists; Langham
esquired by D’Orsay Turner and Barnash, Sparkes seconded by Sam
Simmonds (of Birmingham) and Joe Rowe. The “sestette” shook hands
in a friendly manner, and the men proceeded to their toilettes, while
umpires and a referee were chosen. All preliminaries being adjusted, and
the colours (white with a scarlet border for Sparkes, and a blue birdseye
for Langham) knotted to the stake, the men toed the scratch for</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On throwing themselves into
position, the advantage on the part of Langham
as to height and length was obvious to
all, while the brawny frame of the Australian
showed him to be the more powerful of
the two. He stood with his left arm straight
out from the shoulder, with his right hand
well up, his body being inclined backwards
in an extraordinary manner. Langham threw
his arms about quickly, as if to put the
Australian off his guard, but in vain. At
length Langham led off with his right,
which was twice cleverly stopped. Sparkes
made play, catching Langham slightly on
the side of the jaw with his left. Langham
again tried his left, but was again stopped.
In another attempt he was more successful,
and caught the Australian on the nose
slightly. Sparkes closed, delivered two
good body blows, and both were down.
(The opinion round the ring was that the
Australian was far from being the “novice”
that he was anticipated to be.)</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Langham led off at the nose with his
left, and got on smartly. Sparkes returned
heavily with his right on the body and side
of the head with his left, knocking Langham
off his legs. (<em>First knock-down for Sparkes</em>,
amidst some astonishment.)</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Langham immediately led off, getting
slightly home on the body. Sparkes dashed
in, hit up on the forehead, then fibbed his
man in the ribs with the right, and Langham
got down.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Langham made play and worked in at
his man, who got cleverly away. Sparkes
then went to him, delivered his favourite
body blow, Langham staggered back against
the ropes, and got down.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;No hesitation on either side; Sparkes
stopped two well-intended compliments
from his adversary’s left. Counter-hits
exchanged, Sparkes getting it on the nose
twice, but without impression. Langham
slipped down.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Sparkes tried his left and right, but
was short in both attempts. Langham
jobbed him in the left cheek heavily, and
got down in the half-arm hitting, evidently
not anxious to test the strength of his
adversary in a close.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Langham led off with his left, but
Sparkes met him with a heavy hit on the
body, and Langham went down.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Langham again tried to lead off, but
the Australian was as quick as himself,
countered him in the forehead, Langham
getting in sharply, at a well-judged distance,
on his adversary’s nose, from which he displaced
the bark, and drew <em>first blood</em>.
Sparkes delivered his right heavily on the
ribs, knocking Langham down for the
second time.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Langham first to fight, catching
Sparkes on the side of his nose, Sparkes
returning heavily on the chest and ribs with
both hands, and Langham down.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;The men rushed together, and after
a slight exchange of hits, Langham slipped
down.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Langham commenced by delivering
his left heavily on Sparkes’s left eye.
Sparkes caught him on the forehead with
his left, on the body with his right, and
Langham got down.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Langham delivered on the left cheek,
received a slight body blow, and got down.
Sparkes by far the stronger man.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Good body blows were exchanged.
Langham then planted upon his adversary’s
nose with his left; Sparkes let fly at the
body, and Langham was again down.
</p>
<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pageno">241</span>

<p>     14 and 15.&mdash;&#8203;Sparkes forced the fighting,
but Langham jobbed him heavily as he came
in. Sparkes delivered very slightly on the
ribs, and Langham got down leary. [The
fighting was extremely quick, no round
having lasted half a minute. Fourteen
minutes had now elapsed.]</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Langham got well in on the side of
the head with his left twice as Sparkes tried
to bore in. Counter-hits exchanged, Sparkes
napping it on the nose, and Langham on the
body. The latter then slipped down.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Good counter-hits and a sharp rally;
a close, in which Langham fibbed his man
in the head, and after a short struggle both
were down, Sparkes this time under.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Sparkes led off, getting in one on the
ribs with his right, and his left on the forehead,
but too short to be effective. Langham
seemed to have got the measure of his
man; he jobbed him heavily in the left eye
and on the cheek, and got down.</p>

<p>     19 to 21.&mdash;&#8203;Similar to the last. Rapid
fighting, Sparkes occasionally putting in a
body blow, Langham jobbing him severely
in the head, and getting down in the close.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Langham led off with his left,
catching the Australian heavily on the side
of his head; Sparkes returned on the nose,
but not heavily. Langham then planted his
left severely on Sparkes’s right cheek,
drawing the claret. Sparkes closed, threw
his man, and fell over him.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Langham tried to open with sparring
on the defensive, but Sparkes forced the
fighting. Heavy exchanges left and right,
those of Langham drawing more blood from
Sparkes’s cheek and eye, Sparkes still
fighting at the body. Langham eventually
got down.</p>

<p>     24 to 32.&mdash;&#8203;Langham took the lead in these
rounds, Sparkes hitting with less precision;
Nat repeatedly jobbed his man heavily in
the face, but Sparkes was thorough game,
and would not be denied; he occasionally
put in a body blow which sounded all over
the ring; Sparkes’s left eye was fast closing,
and his right cheek showed marks of punishment.
In the 32nd round, in a rally,
Langham caught the Australian a severe
blow with his right on the left ear, from
which the blood was quickly seen to flow.
Langham showed no marks beyond a slight
swelling on his forehead, and a redness about
his ribs. So quick was the fighting that
only 32 minutes had been occupied up to the
close of this round.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;Sparkes changed his style a little
and hit higher, declining to be drawn on.
He sent his right well home on Langham’s
jaw; Langham returned with his left on the
left eye-brow, which he cut. Sparkes then
got in his right on Langham’s left eye, on
which he raised a slight mouse. Langham
got down in an attempt by Sparkes to
close.</p>

<p>     34 and 35.&mdash;&#8203;Langham met his man as he
came in with well-directed jobs, the Australian
still fighting at the body. In the latter
round he closed, and threw Langham, falling
on him.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;Counter-hits; Langham catching his
adversary heavily on the left ear, again
drawing blood. Sparkes rushed in, delivered
his favourite body blow, and again knocked
Nat clean off his legs.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;Langham came up slow, the last hit
had evidently shaken him. Sparkes rushed
at him to follow up his advantage, but Langham
stopped him right and left, got away,
and ultimately slipped down.</p>

<p>     38.&mdash;&#8203;Langham, still keeping away, propped
the Australian as he came in, and got down.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;Langham had not yet recovered himself
from the visitation in the 36th round,
but Sparkes could not get the lead, as his
man not only stopped cleverly, but got
away immediately he went to him, and
eventually slipped down.</p>

<p>     From this to the 58th round the same
style of fighting was continued; the men
commenced work immediately on arriving at
the scratch. Sparkes’s body blows came
in occasionally with great force, but some
were stopped by Langham very prettily,
and the latter recovering his strength, he
jobbed his man severely in the head.
Sparkes’s right eye was following suit with
his left, which was quite closed, and
blood was drawn every round from his ear
or cheek. The rounds were almost invariably
finished by Langham going down to avoid
the struggle and throw. In the 50th round,
after a few rattling exchanges, Sparkes, for
the fourth time, sent his man to grass, with
a heavy right-handed hit in the ribs.</p>

<p>     59 to 61.&mdash;&#8203;Langham propped his man
heavily as he attempted to come in. Sparkes,
however, fought with unflinching courage,
and would not retreat, and often bored Nat
down.</p>

<p>     62.&mdash;&#8203;Langham got home on Sparkes’s
neck, Sparkes returned on the ribs. A close
followed, in which Langham was down, with
Sparkes on him. Sparkes unfortunately had
his right arm under his man, who fell heavily
on it, and, as it afterwards appeared, broke
the bone of his forearm. On coming up for
the 63rd round, Sparkes held his right arm
up, but was quickly compelled to drop it,
from the pain he suffered. Langham went
in and milled away until the Australian
went down. From this to the 67th and last
round Sparkes came up bravely, keeping
his right arm close to his side, and attempted
to plant upon his man with his left; it was
of course in vain. Langham was too good
a strategist to be planted on, and working in
with both hands upon the game fellow in
each round, punishing him until he went
down. He was repeatedly asked by his
seconds to give in, but in vain; his game
was such that he almost disdained to sit on
his second’s knee until the call of time.
At length, in the 67th round, Johnny Broome
entered the ring and threw up his hat in
<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pageno">242</span>
token of defeat, after a contest of 68 minutes,
and even then it was with the greatest
difficulty that Sparkes’s seconds could prevent
his rising and rushing at his man to
have another “shy.” A gamer or more
fearless boxer never entered the Ring.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Langham in this contest confirmed
the opinion we entertained of his
former fight with Gutteridge. He is a clever,
scientific fighter, good on his legs, and a heavy
hitter; and although the practice of getting
down is anything but commendable, still,
with a determined adversary, possessing superior
bodily powers, every allowance must
be made for the caution of a wily general.
He evidently saw that to struggle with such
a man as Sparkes would be attended with
no advantage to himself, and he therefore determined
not to throw a chance away. His superior
length, and his quickness in meeting
the Australian hero as he came in, in a great
measure protected his mug from damage;
but the fact of his leaving the ring with
scarcely a scratch was mainly to be attributed
to the style of Sparkes, who, when he
fought at the head, invariably hit too high
to do damage. Sparkes proved himself one
of the gamest fellows that ever pulled off a
shirt; he is a hard hitter, and stops with
great neatness; but in Langham he contended
with an adversary who had the advantage
of him in every respect except in
strength and courage (the latter attribute
was not, however, wanting in either man).
Notwithstanding the severe punishment he received
about the head, however, he came up as
strong on his legs at the end as at the commencement
of the fight, and in almost every
round declined all assistance of his seconds
to carry him to his corner. Had it not been
for the accident to his arm in the 65th round,
the contest would, no doubt, have lasted
longer, possibly with a different result. As
to style, however, Langham was the superior
fighter. The affair concluded, all returned
to town per train, and “The Nymph,” in attendance
at Nine Elms, conveyed her cargo
to the port whence they embarked. The
battle money was given to Langham at Ben
Caunt’s. This is the first time that Sparkes
was beaten, having fought in and out of the
ring in N.S.W. with several men. His last
four adversaries were Chas. Wooten, of Nottingham
(N.S.W.), for £25 a side; Joe Marshall,
of the same place, for £50 a side; Bill
Davis, of Liverpool (N.S.W.), for £100 a
side (after the conquest of whom he received
his belt); and “Tom the brewer,” for £100 a
side.</p>

<p>The stakes were presented to Langham at Ben Caunt’s, when a collection
was made for the losing man. This was considerably augmented on the
Friday week following at a benefit given to Sparkes at Johnny Broome’s.
Of course the “tuggites,” and some of those thrown out by Johnny’s
strategic movement on the previous Tuesday, were loud in their denunciations
of his “shameful conduct,” as it was termed. At these Johnny laughed,
while the sporting Press reminded them that “they had only themselves to
blame for their disappointment.”</p>

<p>Nat’s victory over Sparkes was certainly calculated to place him in the
very front rank of middle-weight boxers, and from this time until the
beginning of the year ’51 he was “laid up in lavender,” until after all
sorts of negotiations, and breaks-off with all sorts of men, some too
heavy, and others thinking themselves too light, unless Nat (who had
never much to get off in the way of flesh) could consent to reduce
himself, Harry Orme, though more than half a stone heavier, was proposed.
Orme’s defeat of Aaron Jones, in December, 1849, had proved
him a strong, resolute, and formidable, if not a scientific boxer, and
his friends, thinking his chance a good one, entered into articles for
£50 a side, the battle to be decided on the 6th of May, 1851. On
this occasion Nat was doomed to experience his first and only defeat, after
a contest which <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> characterises as “one of the gamest battles the
<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pageno">243</span>
annals of the Ring can boast;” the details of which will be found in
the ensuing chapter in the Life of <span class="sc">Harry Orme</span>.</p>

<p>Langham, who was always a well-conducted, steady fellow, now went
into business as a publican at the Ram Inn, Bridge Street, Cambridge,
where he won “golden opinions from all sorts of men,” securing the
patronage of many University undergrads, and for two years none cared
to dispute his title as “Champion of the Middle-weights,” a distinction a
quarter of a century ago fully recognised at a period when the heavy
weights had certainly sadly degenerated, though the time had yet to
come in which “the Championship of England” should be held by a boxer
under 11 stone!</p>

<p>So highly were Langham’s capabilities in his contest with Orme esteemed
by all who witnessed that gallant fight, that his name was continually to
the fore, not only in Cambridge, but among the Corinthians who held
their conversaziones at Jem Burn’s, at the “Rising Sun;” at Owen Swift’s
“Horseshoe;” at Limmer’s Hotel, and “The Corner;” while among
the knowing ones who frequented Ben Caunt’s “Coach and Horses,”
at Peter Crawley’s “Duke’s Head,” and places further east, all were of
opinion that “Clever Nat” was not to be beaten by any man who had not
a great pull in respect of weight.</p>

<p>There was, however, a sporting-house, unnamed by us as yet, situated
in a street off the once-famed Seven Dials, where lived an ex-pugilist
(recently deceased) who was unquestionably as good a judge of the merits
of a fighting man as ever lived. This was Alec Keene, of the “Three
Tuns,” Moor Street, Soho; and there were not a few Corinthians who
often threaded their way through the intricacies of Soho to have a palaver
with Alec Keene, and learn his straight opinion as to the chances of the
competitors in some coming fight, or as to the advisability of backing this
or the other candidate for a match. Among these we remember “young”
Sir Robert Peel, his gallant brother William (both of them splendid
boxers), Lord Ongley, Lord Drumlanrig, Sir Edward Kent, Colonel
Higgins, Lord Winchilsea, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum multis aliis</span>.</p>

<p>Now, among the special pets of Alec foremost stood Tom Sayers,
whose merits Keene was the first among the professionals to fully perceive
and boldly declare; and he never ceased to use his influence in finding
him backers, in which he was zealously seconded by Harry Brunton.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_24" id="fnanchor_24"></a><a href="#footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span>

</p>
<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pageno">244</span>

<p>After Tom had beaten Jack Martin, in the January of 1853, both he
and his friend Alec (who acted as his second on that occasion) were confident
that the championship of the middle-weights was well within his
reach, notwithstanding the admitted excellence of Nat Langham. Consequently,
after many discussions and conferences, the money was made all
right, and a challenge was issued from Moor Street, in which Tom announced
his readiness to meet the redoubtable Nat on his own terms.
There was some laughing in Air Street at Tom’s audacity, and in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Martin’s Lane, although in the city on the Cam lots of “collegians” were
ready to find a bit of Nat’s money. It was soon ascertained, however,
when Langham had accepted the challenge, and a match had been
made to fight for the sum named, on the 18th of October, 1853, that
although Langham was the favourite, his adherents had only to offer the
slightest shade of odds in Tichborne Street or Soho to be at once accommodated
to any amount they desired.</p>

<p>Both men went into active training at an early period. Nat, whose
long rest had rendered him somewhat rusty, retired to country quarters,
under the care of Jemmy Welsh, who had to give him a full dose of work
to bring him, without any loss of power, within the stipulated 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, though
at this period Nat’s fighting weight was only two or three pounds in excess of
that point. However, his training went smoothly on, without a break or a
hitch of any kind, and, as will be seen presently, he was brought to the
post in prime fettle. Tom, on the other hand, who had, as usual, gone
down to the neighbourhood of Brighton&mdash;&#8203;his mentor and attendant being
the celebrated pedestrian, Bob Fuller&mdash;&#8203;encountered quite a series of mischances.
He first caught a severe cold, almost deserving to be called an
influenza, which stopped him in his work. This was followed by an ugly
breaking out on his face and chin, which certainly did not indicate that
his blood was in its ordinary healthful condition. No difficulties of this
kind dismayed either Tom or his backers, and, consequently, <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> on
the 16th of October was enabled to announce that both men were well and
full of confidence. In consequence of the day fixed for the fight being
the opening day of the Warwick Meeting, there had been an endeavour to
alter the day to the Monday previous, but as this was the settling-day for
the Cesarewitch, the alteration would have been no improvement, if, indeed,
not rather the reverse, as backers and bookmakers would both be compelled
to show at Tattersall’s&mdash;&#8203;the lucky backer of Haco to receive, and
the unfortunate followers of the ill-fated Nabob (who was second that
<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pageno">245</span>
year in both the great handicaps to the turned loose youngsters, Haco
and Little David) to part with what had so nearly brought them safe
home.</p>

<p>On another account it was fortunate that the fixture remained unchanged,
for on Monday the rain came down in an almost ceaseless downpour from
morning till night, and the Corinthians and professionals who assembled
at Caunt’s and Alec Keene’s in the evening, to obtain their tickets for the
excursion, and the straight tip as to the time and place of departure,
prognosticated somewhat gloomily as to the weather possibilities of the
morrow.</p>

<p>Fortunately, these prophecies were falsified by the event, and shortly
before eight o’clock, as hansom after hansom dashed up to the Eastern
Counties Railway Station, in Shoreditch&mdash;&#8203;the directors had not yet
become sufficiently aristocratic to call it the Great Eastern Station,
Bishopsgate, nor had they attained their grand terminus at Liverpool Street&mdash;&#8203;their
occupants shook hands heartily with the first acquaintance they
encountered, and congratulated themselves on the bright October sun,
which was making even the dingy East End look moderately cheerful. At
half-past eight the train started, and after a pleasant journey of about
three hours, past Cambridge, Ely, and Mildenhall, pulled up at Lakenheath,
in Suffolk, and the living cargo, which numbered not less than four hundred,
among whom were most of the Corinthian supporters of the Ring,
who had come down under the special care of Jem Burn, invaded and
overran the little station.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who slumbered too long to refresh the inner man
satisfactorily before leaving, a copious breakfast had been provided by
Mr. Moore, of the “Old Rum Puncheon,” Moorfields, who, we are happy
to say, still survives in this year of grace, 1881, the hale and hearty host
of the “Royal Standard” at Walthamstow. Ample justice being done to this
repast, we found that Tom Oliver, assisted by Tom Callas, had decided on
the spot for the ring, in a field about two hundred yards from the stopping-place.
While the stakes and ropes were being placed <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</span>, Dan Dismore
attended to the sale of inner ring tickets; and the character of the gathering
may be inferred from the fact that about one in five of the travellers
elected to become purchasers of “privilege” cards. The men having made
their toilets, Sayers, just at half-past twelve, shied his castor into the ring,
following it himself, with his seconds, Alec Keene and Bob Fuller. Tom
received a loud and hearty greeting from his partisans; and this had hardly
<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pageno">246</span>
died away when the cheers were renewed as Nat Langham entered, attended
by the accomplished Jemmy Welsh and Jerry Noon, who was equally
clever as a second when&mdash;&#8203;as upon this occasion he did&mdash;&#8203;he could refrain
from those eccentric performances for which he was notorious, and which,
however amusing they might be to the spectators, were anything but useful
to his principal. On this particular day Jerry was on his good behaviour, and
did not once attempt to raise a laugh until the fight was over. Immediately
on entering the ring Tom and Nat, who were “old pals,” shook hands with
great cordiality, evoking the cheers of the onlookers, who were delighted
at this proof that the combatants were actuated only by the desire to win
fame and reputation, and, in fact, realised the description of the prizefighter
by the poet:&mdash;</p>

<p>This episode completed, the referee and umpires having taken their
places, the seconds retired to their corners, and all was attention as the men
approached each other and began</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On toeing the scratch the knowing
ones eagerly scanned the appearance and
condition of the men, in order, if possible, to
gain thus some indication of the possible issue
of the combat, and a few bets were made at 6
to 4 on Langham. There was a wide contrast
between the men, both in appearance and
condition; Langham was long and lathy; his
frame was evidently that of a man who had
seen severe work, and&mdash;&#8203;to all appearance&mdash;&#8203;not
likely to last through the wear and tear
of long-continued exertion. There was a
smile of good-humoured confidence on his
mug, however, that showed how little he
feared the result of the coming combat,
while his condition was simply perfect, and
reflected the highest credit on his trainer.
Sayers, on the other hand, although he
looked&mdash;&#8203;as of old&mdash;&#8203;broad, strong, and burly,
was clearly overburdened with flesh&mdash;&#8203;the 5<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>
he scaled above his accustomed 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>
being palpably all to the bad. The breaking
out on his chin and face, already alluded to,
certainly did not give one the idea of his
being in a perfect state of health, and it may
well be that to the fact of his not being in
his best form may be attributed an anxious
look about his eyes, so different to the gay,
laughing confidence he exhibited in his
other fights. Both men, on taking up
position, stood with their legs too wide
apart; their guards were neither easy nor
graceful, nor was there anything strikingly
artistic in their attitudes. They began with
a good deal of sparring, and, at length,
Langham let go his left, but did not
get quite home. Caution was again the
order of the day, until Langham once more
got within distance, and tried his left a
second time, just reaching Tom’s chest.
Sayers now tried to draw his man, but Langham
was not to be had. Sayers, therefore,
approached him, when Langham popped in
his left on the cheek, and then the same hand
on the nose, and got away. Sayers soon
followed him up, and Nat, as he retreated,
again sent out his left on the cheek. More
sparring now took place, and, at length,
counter-hits were exchanged, Nat catching
Tom on the chin and drawing <em>first blood</em>
from a pimple below his mouth. Sayers
now bored in, and caught Nat a nasty one
on the forehead, from the effects of which
Langham went to grass. (<em>First knock-down
blow</em> for Sayers.) Little merit, however,
could be attached to it, as the ground was
in such a state from the previous day’s rain
as to render it difficult for Nat to keep
his legs, and the hit rather helped him to
grass than fairly sent him there. Having
now had an opportunity of judging and
comparing the men, the betting settled down
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pageno">247</span>
to 5 to 4 on Nat, the odds being principally
due to Tom’s obviously bad condition, and
to the fact that, having lost the toss for
choice of corners, he had to fight with the
sun in his eyes.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;In this round Nat commenced the
saving game, which he persisted in throughout
the fight, and after planting a tap on
the mouth, and receiving on the forehead,
slipped down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Both men ready to the call of time,
and Langham led off, but the blow fell short
on Tom’s chest. A second attempt was
more successful, as he got home a heavy
spank on Tom’s snout, from which the ruby
was instantly visible. Left-handed counter-hits
followed, each getting it slightly on the
cheek, and Nat, in getting back again slipped
down.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;On getting within distance both went
to work. Tom made his left on Nat’s cheek,
and his right rather heavily on his ribs.
Heavy counter-hits followed, in favour of
Nat, whose length here gave him the advantage.
Tom napped it again severely
on the smeller, just between the eyes, and
returned on Nat’s side of his head and his
short ribs, the latter a sounding right-hander.
Langham now retreated, and, as Tom
followed him up, pinked him twice in succession
with effect on the nozzle, drawing
more claret. Sayers returned slightly on the
ribs, and again was met by Nat on the mouth
and left eye. Sayers continued to persevere,
occasionally getting in a little one on Nat’s
ribs, but Nat in this round appeared to have
it his own way; he propped his man repeatedly
on the nose and mouth, and then
on the dexter eye. Again and again did
Sayers go to it, but Nat jobbed him with it
severely on the old spot, and at length finished
the round by going down, Sayers walking
away, his face brightly crimsoned by Nat’s
handiwork.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Nat, on getting his man, let go with
his left with great quickness on Tom’s nose,
completely over his guard. Sayers then
went to in-fighting, and got home his left on
the side of Nat’s knowledge-box, and, after
a slight rally, both went down. A claim of
foul was made, that Sayers had hit Nat
while down, but it was not allowed, the
men being on the ropes when the blow was
delivered.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Tom came up grinning, but his mug
was in anything but grinning order. Langham,
as usual, led off, but Tom jumped
away. Tom now feinted, let go his left on
Nat’s jaw, and then repeated the dose without
return. Some rattling exchanges followed
in favour of Sayers, and in the end Langham
fell.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Langham attempted to plant his left,
but was out of distance. Two more efforts
were frustrated by Tom jumping away.
Nat was not to be denied; he went in, and
some rattling exchanges took place in favour
of Sayers, who got home on Nat’s cheek and
ribs with severity, and received one or two
on the kissing organ, from which more pink
was drawn, and Langham in getting back
fell.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Langham dodged his man, and again
popped in his left with great quickness over
his guard, turning on the tap. Sayers returned
slightly on the cheek, and, on trying
to improve upon this, was countered heavily
on the mouth. This led to some rapid exchanges
in favour of Sayers, who got home
heavily on the ribs and jaw, and received on
the nasal promontory. The round finished
by Langham going to earth apparently
weak.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers came up with a visible puffiness
under both eyes. Langham, as usual, led
off on Tom’s mouth. Sayers returned left
and right on the canister and ribs, received
another little one on the nose, and then
lunged out with his right a sounding spank
in the side. Langham retreated, and was
followed up by Tom, who caught him on the
mouth with his left, and Nat, after an ineffectual
attempt to return, fell.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Langham stepped back to draw his
man, who came for it, and again napped an
awkward one on the snout. Sayers tried a
return, but was short, and got another smack
on the nose for his pains. Counter-hits followed,
Nat getting it rather heavily on the
left eye, and Tom on the nose. Nat, after
placing a little one on the nose, fell on his
south pole.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Langham opened the pleadings by
another well-delivered spank on the proboscis,
from his left, over Tom’s guard. It was
wonderful to see how completely Sayers’s
index seemed to be within reach of Nat’s
straight-darting deliveries. Left-handed exchanges
followed, but Sayers appeared to
hit short. Langham delivered again with
severity on the bridge of the nose, when
Sayers made a one, two (the left on the side
of the head, and his right on the ribs), and
Langham got down on the saving suit.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;A pause now took place, and some
mutual feinting and dodging, it being “bellows
to mend” on each side. Nat at length
tried his left, which was prettily stopped.
Sayers now went in, made his left and right
on the nose and ribs, but not heavily. Langham
retaliated on the nose, which led to
some slight exchanges, and a close, at the
end of which both fell, Langham under.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers attempted to take the lead,
but was propped heavily on the snuff-box.
He, however, got in his right with severity
on the ribs, and then his left on Nat’s cheek.
Nat’s returns were rendered abortive by the
activity of Tom, who again visited his ribs
heavily with his right, and Langham fell,
Tom falling over him.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Langham resumed his lead, and got
well on to Tom’s damaged nose and mouth.
Sayers’s nose and cheeks puffing visibly, to
the great danger of his clear sight for attack
or defence. Tom countered him heavily on
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pageno">248</span>
cheek and ribs, and Langham fell, Tom on
him.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers went to his man, planted his
left on the side of Nat’s brain-pan. Langham
returned on the neck with his right, a
round hit, and fell in getting away.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Nat sent in his left, over Tom’s
guard, upon his nose heavily, and again
turned on the main. Good counters followed,
Nat on the nose, and Tom on the neck heavily.
Exchanges, in which Tom got on to Nat’s left
cheek, and Langham got down, Sayers falling
over him.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Langham was short in two attempts
with his left, and a third was stopped, when
Sayers dashed out his left, getting home on
the ribs. Langham returned with good
effect on the nose, and both fell.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Long sparring until Nat let fly his left
on the old spot. Tom made his right on the
ribs, but again got a nasty crack on the side of
his cranium, and Langham got down.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Nat was again short in his lead. Tom
was more successful, got home his right on
the ribs, and Nat was again down.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;This was a good round on both sides.
After a little sparring Langham tried his
left, but Tom jumped well away. In a
second attempt Nat got slightly home on the
chest, and then on the nose. Sayers countered
him on the mouth, and then some
exchanges took place, in which Nat hit the
straightest, Tom’s blows appearing to be
open-handed. Sayers now went in, but got
it heavily on the nose from Nat, who fought
on the retreat. Tom followed him up, got
well home on the jaw, and then on the nose
and left eye, knocking Langham clean off
his legs. (A fair knock-down blow.)</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Tho last blow delivered by Sayers was
evidently a stinger, as Nat’s left peeper and
nose showed the effects of it. Tom immediately
led off, got in his left and right on
the nose and ribs without a return, and then,
closing, threw Langham a back-fall, and fell
heavily on him. (5 to 4 offered by an enthusiastic
backer of Tom’s.)</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Hitting over Tom’s guard Nat got
well on Tom’s nose, but Sayers returning
heavily on the mouth, Nat got back, and
fell.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Odds of 5 to 4 on Sayers were now
freely offered all round the ring, and he certainly
seemed to have much the best of it,
was full of confidence, and at once opened
proceedings by sending in his left heavily on
Nat’s ivory-box. The latter tried to get
away, but Tom followed him up closely and
again landed on the mouth, avoiding the return.
Severe counter-hitting followed, in
which Sayers again got on to Nat’s mouth,
but received on the smeller, and then Langham
went to the earth in a decided state of
weakness.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers, attempting to force the fighting
all he could, again led off on Nat’s left
cheek, and Nat retaliated on the nose heavily.
Tom retreated, and, on going to it again,
popped in his right on Nat’s commissariat
department. He tried a repetition of this,
but napped it severely on the nose for his
pains. After some sparring Tom reached
Nat’s ribs, and the latter, reaching his own
corner, got down.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers, first to begin, delivered a
little one on Nat’s nose, but the blow wanted
steam. Nat retreated, and as Tom followed
him, Nat jobbed him on the nozzle, again
disturbing the cochineal; and on receiving a
little one on the chin Nat dropped.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Nat began the attack by a successful
endeavour to resume his lead. He got home
heavily on Tom’s left cheek, which led to
exchanges in favour of Nat, who repeatedly
met Tom in the middle of the head. Tom
got in one or two on the ribs and chest, and
one on Nat’s left peeper, but not heavily.
Nat returned on the face, and in retreating
slipped down.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Langham again made play on Tom’s
nose, the cork being drawn. He got in a little
one on the ribs in return, and Nat fell,
Sayers on him.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;On coming up Nat led off, but misjudged
his distance and was short, the blow
falling on Tom’s cheek. Tom sent out his
left, but got a very heavy one on his mouth
in return. Some heavy exchanges followed,
in which Tom got well home on Nat’s cheek,
from the effect of which Nat fell.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;One hour had now elapsed, and still
there was no decided lead. Langham was
again short in his opening deliveries, and
Sayers, after returning on the left cheek,
closed and threw his man, falling heavily on
him.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;Nat’s left once more fell short of its
destination, when Tom let out his left and
caught him on the mouth; Langham returned
quickly on the nose, from which
once more the ruby trickled. Slight exchanges
followed, and Langham fell evidently
weak.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers led off, caught Nat a heavy
cross hit with his left over the left peeper,
inflicting a deep cut and drawing the carmine;
he in return had his cork drawn by
Nat’s left. Some exchanges followed, in the
course of which Tom again opened the cut
over Nat’s left ogle by a heavy hit from his
left, and Nat fell.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;Another good round. Nat’s left
peeper looked the worse for wear, but he
came gamely up, and as Tom led off he
countered him on the nose. Some exchanges
followed in favour of Sayers, who got well
on Nat’s left cheek, and received a return on
the cheek-bone. They now got to work
in earnest, and some ding-dong fighting took
place, as if both thought this the turning
point of the battle. Each got it heavily on
the frontispiece, Sayers re-opening the cut
over Nat’s left eye, and receiving one or two
awkward reminders on the cheek and nose.
A break away followed, and then Langham
again went up to his man, who met him on
<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pageno">249</span>
the left eye another heavy spank. Nat returned
on the nozzle, and immediately afterwards
received another reminder on the
sinister peeper, and fell. This was a capital
fighting round, exhibiting the determined
resolve of both men.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers led off, got home slightly on
the throat, and received a heavy one from
Nat’s left on the right cheek. Excellent
counter-hits followed, Tom on the cheek and
Nat on the right peeper, and Nat then got
down.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Long sparring, Langham evidently
wanting wind, and Tom not much better.
At last Nat went to work, got well on Tom’s
damaged nose with his left, and stopped
Tom’s return. Sayers tried again, and
succeeded in reaching Nat’s throat, when
the latter again fell.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;Another fighting round. Good counter-hits,
each receiving on the left eye. A
break away and more counter-hitting, Sayers
on the left peeper, and Nat well on the
nose. Langham now lunged out his right
with great force, but, luckily for Tom, the
blow missed its destination, and Nat, overreaching
himself, fell.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;Nat, on coming up, showed his left
peeper in deep mourning, and nearly closed;
he was evidently weak, and the friends of Sayers
were up in the stirrups. Sayers feinted,
and let out his left, which reached the
damaged optic, re-opening the former wound.
Langham was short in his return. Sayers
twice got home his left on the throat, but
was stopped in the third attempt; he afterwards
succeeded in reaching Nat’s left cheek,
and the latter, after an ineffectual attempt
to return, got down.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;In spite of the punishment he had
received in the previous round, Langham
was first up, and he sent out his left, but
Tom jumped quickly away, returned heavily
on the forehead and ribs, and then fell.</p>

<p>     38.&mdash;&#8203;Some ineffectual countering, after
which Sayers got nearer, and put in a little
one on the left eye. Nat retreated, and on
being followed by Tom, who delivered
straight on the mouth, got down weak.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;There could be no question as to the
gallantry with which both men were fighting,
and although appearances were in favour of
Sayers, there were not wanting those who
saw the danger lying before him, and among
these must assuredly be numbered Nat’s
clever seconds, under whose directions and
advice Langham now seemed to devote himself
to land just one blow on Tom’s swollen
nose, or on one of his puffy eyes, and then to
get down with as little punishment and as
little exertion as possible; for it was impossible
to conceal Nat’s weakness, and it was
decidedly a moot point whether he would
be able to hold out until Tom could be
forced to “put up the shutters.” Nat tried
to lead off, but was stopped. Sayers attempted
to return, but Nat sent out his left
very straight on the left eye, and on Sayers
again coming on, he delivered the same hand
on Tom’s damaged smeller, and drew more
claret. Tom made his left slightly on the
cheek, and Nat at once went to grass.</p>

<p>     40.&mdash;&#8203;Tom let go his left, got slightly home
on the chest, and Nat, after returning with
his left on the forehead, fell.</p>

<p>     41.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers tried to take the lead, but
Nat jumped quickly away; Sayers followed
him up, when Nat met him with a sharp
tap on the left eye, and then another left-hander
on the cheek. Sayers persevered
until he got home his right on Nat’s ribs,
when the latter again got down.</p>

<p>     42.&mdash;&#8203;Nat led off, caught Tom heavily on
the left cheek and then on the brow. He
tried to repeat the visitation, when Tom
caught him sharply over the right peeper,
drawing blood, and Nat got down. Nat’s
length and cleverness were conspicuous in
his left-hand deliveries.</p>

<p>     43.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers rushed in, but Nat countered
him on the left peeper. Sayers got in his
right heavily on the bread-basket, and Nat
fell.</p>

<p>     44.&mdash;&#8203;After a little sparring, the men got
close together, and some sharp counter-hits
were exchanged, Tom getting well on to
Nat’s damaged left peeper, and receiving on
the right cheek. Nat now attempted another
delivery, but overreached himself and fell.</p>

<p>     45.&mdash;&#8203;The temporary revival of Langham’s
strength seemed at an end. Sayers let go
his left, got home on the cheek, and Nat,
who was decidedly in “Queer Street,” again
went down sick and weak.</p>

<p>     46.&mdash;&#8203;Nothing done. Nat got down as soon
and as easily as he could manage it.</p>

<p>     47.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers led off, and caught Nat over
the left ogle; this led to some counter-hits,
in which Langham got home heavily on
Tom’s right peeper, which was now pretty
nearly closed from the repeated hits on the
nose and its exposure to the bright rays of
the sun. Langham received a little one on
the left cheek in return, and fell.</p>

<p>     48.&mdash;&#8203;Tom led off, but was countered by
Nat on the left eye. In a second attempt
Nat stopped him, and then popped him
heavily on the nose, drawing more of the
ruby. Nat succeeded in planting another
heavily on the left peeper, and Tom fell for
the first time for many rounds.</p>

<p>     49.&mdash;&#8203;Things looked by no means so cheerful
for Sayers’ backers, for although he was
by far the stronger man on his pins, he now
came up bleeding from both eyes, his seconds
having been compelled to lance them while
he was in his corner to prevent his going
blind. He dashed in, aware that although
much the stronger man on his legs, he must
be in total darkness if he did not finish his
man soon. Slight exchanges took place, Tom
getting it on both eyes slightly, and returning,
but without effect, on Nat’s mouth, and
in the end Sayers was first down.</p>

<p>     50.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers once more dashed in but
was met by Nat on the left peeper. Tom
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pageno">250</span>
returned slightly on the body, and Langham
again went to grass, apparently weak.</p>

<p>     51.&mdash;&#8203;Tom rushed in, delivered his left
heavily on the conk, and then his right on
the ribs without a return, and Nat dropped.</p>

<p>     52.&mdash;&#8203;Tom again went to work, caught
Langham on the side of his nut; Nat returned
on the left peeper, and then slipped
down.</p>

<p>     53.&mdash;&#8203;Tom led off, got home on Langham’s
left eye, but the blow lacked force, and Nat
fell, Sayers falling over him.</p>

<p>     54.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers stepped in with his left, but
was short; he tried it again, catching Nat
on the waistband. Langham attempted a
return, but Sayers jumped away. Nat again
lunged out, but, overreaching himself, fell.</p>

<p>     55.&mdash;&#8203;Nat seemed to shake himself together,
went up to his man, led off with his left on
the right cheek, and got away. Sayers followed
him up, when some sharp exchanges
took place, Nat reaching Tom’s damaged
snout, and once more turning on the tap.
Tom returned the compliment on the left
cheek, and Langham fell weak, Tom falling
over him, not much better off.</p>

<p>     56.&mdash;&#8203;It was now clear that Tom’s peepers
had not many minutes to remain open, and
he therefore at once led off, but was out of
distance; in a second attempt he caught
Nat over the left peeper, but received
another hot one on the nose in return. He
would not be shaken off, however; he followed
Nat and let fly his left on the jaw.
Sharp counter-hits followed, Sayers on the
mouth and nose, and Nat on the right ogle,
and Langham fell.</p>

<p>     57.&mdash;&#8203;Tom at once rushed in, but was
stopped. His next effort reached Nat’s
mouth, and the latter got down.</p>

<p>     58.&mdash;&#8203;Both were nearly pumped out, and it
was evident that a chance hit might finish
Langham, while Sayers, if he could not
deliver that hit, must soon “cut it.” The
men let fly simultaneously, each getting it
on the frontispiece. A break away followed,
after which Tom reached Nat’s left eye, but
not effectively. A close, in which Tom
caught his man with his right as he went
down, and then fell on him.</p>

<p>     59.&mdash;&#8203;Langham went to his man, delivered
his left heavily on the nose, and received a
little one on the jaw. He then rushed at
Sayers, who stepped back, and Nat, missing
his mark, fell.</p>

<p>     60.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers’s fate was sealed; like
Jack Broughton in the memorable account
of Captain Godfrey,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_25" id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span>
he might have exclaimed,
“I can’t see my man; I’m blind,
not beat. Only let me see my man and he
shall not gain the day yet!” Tom rushed in
open-handed. Nat stepped on one side, met
him as he came on the left peeper, and then
beside the nose. Tom persevered, but Langham
easily avoided him, and then propped
him in the mouth heavily. Tom continued
to bore in, and got in a round hit on the side
of Nat’s head, whereon Nat returned with
his left just behind Tom’s ear, and both fell.
Sayers evidently all abroad.</p>

<p>     61 and last.&mdash;&#8203;It was beyond a doubt now
that Sayers could not see what he was doing
or where he was going, and there were
loud cries from his backers of “take him
away,” which Alec Keene was anxious to do;
but Tom, full of pluck as ever, resolutely
refused to give in, and swinging his arms,
walked deliberately to the scratch. He
lunged out, but could not judge his distance,
and Nat, waiting for him coolly until he came
again, hit him heavily on the right eye.
Poor Tom struck out wildly and altogether
at random, and Nat getting out of his way
delivered a heavy left-hander on the left eye,
which put up the other shutter, and he
rather fell than was knocked down. On
being helped to his corner, despite his
entreaties, Alec Keene, seeing there was no
hope, threw up the sponge, and Langham
was proclaimed the victor in this truly gallant
struggle, after a contest that had been
protracted for two hours and two minutes.
Immediately the fiat had been pronounced in
his favour, Nat walked across the ring to
shake hands with his defeated opponent,
who shed bitter tears of disappointment and
humiliation, while Nat, seeming to acquire
fresh strength from the consciousness of victory,
contrived to leap over the ropes,
although five minutes before he could hardly
stand on his legs.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Nothing could possibly be
farther from our thoughts or wishes than
any attempt to detract from the gallant
achievements of Nat Langham in thus maintaining
his title as middle-weight champion,
and also earning a lasting fame as the only
man who ever licked Tom Sayers. Still, in
fairness to the beaten man, it must be
remembered that Sayers was at that time by
no means either so good a boxer nor so strong
a man as he became a few years later, when
he defeated one big man after another.
Moreover, his defeat was palpably owing to
his want of condition, in consequence of
which his face puffed up and his eyes closed
with far less punishment than he could
otherwise have taken scatheless. But when
all allowances have been made, the fact
remains, that the gallant Nat did defeat the
otherwise invincible Tom, and thus worthily
dosed a pugilistic career, which, like Sayers’s,
had only once been clouded by defeat.
Nothing could be more deserving of the
highest praise and warmest admiration than
the cool courage and calculating generalship
with which, when he found that the superior
strength of his adversary was likely to prove
too much for him, he at once adopted the
only system of tactics likely to serve him,
and deliberately set to work to avert defeat
by blinding his opponent. How skilfully he
<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pageno">251</span>
carried this plan into effect we have seen,
and it is interesting to remember that Sayers
never forgot the lesson he had received, but
himself put it into practical effect on the
occasion of his fight with Heenan.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Sayers’s gallant stand was duly appreciated by his friends, and upwards
of fifty pounds were collected for him in the train during the homeward
journey. Immediately he had recovered his eyesight Tom challenged
Langham to another trial of skill, but Nat announced his retirement from
the Ring; and, further, his opening of the “Cambrian Stores,” Castle
Street, Leicester Square, where he decorated a showy lamp, bearing his
name and the inscription, “Champion of the Middle-weights.” At this
period our hero developed into a publican; for your successful pugilist is
a publican in chrysalis, so sure as a caddis shall become a May-fly in due
season. Sayers, however, had also become the landlord of the “Bricklayers’
Arms,” in his favourite locality of Camden Town, and demurred to Nat’s
lamp and inscription. “Here am I,” said he, “ready for all comers, Nat
Langham included. He has been beaten by Harry Orme, who has retired,
and I have been beaten by him. As I do not believe myself conquered on
my merits, but by inferior condition, I claim the Championship of the
Middle-weights.”</p>

<p>The introduction of Harry Orme’s name is irrelevant, as Orme,
Aaron Jones (12 stone), Tom Paddock (12 stone), Harry Broome
(12 stone), claimed and fought for the actual and unlimited “Championship,”
during the interregnum closed by Tom Sayers’s successive disposal
of Aaron Jones, Bill Perry (the Tipton Slasher), 13 stone, Bill Benjamin
(Bainge), 12 stone, and Tom Paddock. Quitting this point, however, Nat’s
reply was conclusive. He had espoused the niece of Ben Caunt, had
settled down, and did not see why he should risk all these “hostages given
to fortune,” by trusting what Captain Godfrey calls in his sketch of
Broughton, “a battle to a waning age.” Langham’s health, too, never
robust, was by no means A 1, and he prudently preferred leaving off a
winner, as disposing of such a boxer as Tom Sayers was by no means what
betting men would call a “safe thing.” He, therefore, in a brief epistle
declined Tom’s cartel, and told him he might paint his lamp at the “Bricklayers’
Arms” in any way he chose; meantime that he, Langham, had won
the title of Middle-weight Champion and meant to wear it, and certainly
should not transfer it from Castle Street to Camden Town; and there the
controversy closed.</p>

<p>We should here close the history of Nat Langham’s career in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>
<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><span class="pageno">252</span>
but for the regrettable incident of his rescinding his commendable resolution
of retirement four years later, in 1857, in the September of which
year, owing to some domestic jars with his relative and neighbour,
“Big Ben,” the ill-assorted pair met in battle array to decide their fistic
merits, also who should forfeit a stake of £100 to the other, and to settle a
family feud in which the public could not feel the slightest possible
interest. How they did not achieve either of these three results will be
found fully set forth in our account of their drawn-battle, in the Life of
<span class="sc">Caunt</span>, in Chapter <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> of the present volume.</p>

<p>Langham, in his later years, was host of the “Mitre” tavern in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="h4head">HARRY ORME.<br />
1849&ndash;1853.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> brown-skinned, hardy, game, and resolute boxer, whose name heads
this somewhat brief biography, demands a niche in our gallery of prize
pugilists who have aspired to the Championship, were it only for the obstinately
contested battles in which he was engaged on each of the four
occasions in which he made a public appearance in the twenty-four foot
enclosure. In the short period between December, 1849, and April, 1853,
Harry advanced from the position of a “novice” to that of a candidate,
and a very dangerous one, for the Championship of England; reckoning
among those who succumbed to his prowess, Aaron Jones (twice), the
accomplished Nat Langham&mdash;&#8203;the only conqueror of Tom Sayers&mdash;&#8203;and
closing his career by one of the most memorable battles of modern times,
in which he fell before the conquering arm of Harry Broome.</p>

<p>Harry Orme was by birth a Londoner, having first seen daylight at Old
Ford, near Bow, in the month of May, 1826; in which year, also, were
born his antagonist, Harry Broome, and the yet more renowned Tom
Sayers, doubtless under the influence of some pugilistic planet. Harry,
who “came of decent people,” was introduced to the London Ring with
less preliminary paragraphing than usual; he was an East-Ender by birth,
parentage, and associations, and an East-Ender he remained to the end of
his career.</p>

<p>It so happened that in the year 1849, Jem Burn, the Mæcenas of millers,
had among his visitors at the “Queen’s Head” a powerful big one, hight
Aaron Jones, of Shrewsbury, 20 years of age, weighing 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, standing
5<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> 10½<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> in his stocking-feet, who had friends among the “proud
Salopians,” who were anxious to get on a match with any “trial horse”
Jem might select for their promising novice. Jones had passed a
<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pageno">254</span>
favourable “competitive examination” in the sparring schools, and Jem
had declared, with a qualifying <em>if</em>, that “<em>If</em> there was the right stuff in
him he was big enough and clever enough for anything then on the list.”
The “sages of the East” were of opinion that they had a novice as
good as he of the West, so Harry, after taking stock of his opponent <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
futuro</span> at a sparring <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirée</span> in Windmill Street, returned to his friends at
the “Blue Anchor,” and “reported progress.” The result was favourable
to a venture of the East against the West, the Orientals already well
knowing that their man would take a great deal of beating to turn him from
brown to blue. Articles were accordingly formulated at Mr. Hunter’s,
“Weavers’ Arms,” Kingsland Road, with deposits at “Jolly Jem’s,” for a
fight to come off on the 18th December, 1849, each man not to exceed
11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> on the day before the fight. Frimley Green, Surrey, was duly
reached per train on the day appointed, and at a quarter to one, in a
drizzle of cold rain, the men entered the ring. The “Shrewsbury Youth”
was waited on by Jack Hannan and Bob Fuller, the pedestrian; Orme by
two well-known East End professionals, Joe Rowe and John Hazeltine.
Umpires and a referee were quickly agreed upon; and the colours, a blue
birdseye for Orme, and a fancy orange, shot with green, with a blue
border, for Jones, being knotted to the stake, the men and their seconds
crossed hands, and the principal performers stood up for</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Considering that the men were
novices, there was a good deal of money laid
out on the mill, Jones being made the
favourite at 5 and 6 to 4&mdash;&#8203;chiefly from
having the wealthier backers. He certainly,
though young and light downwards, was
lathy, long, and muscular, and looked dangerously
like a fighter; while Orme, compact,
well knit, and determined, seemed,
with his mahogany frontispiece and walnut-brown
skin, more like a gipsy than ever.
Orme squared his elbows in the old-fashioned
style that was called “navigatorish;” while
Jones, though awkward and nervous, showed
the superior school in which he had graduated.
The Young One tried his left, but
Orme jumped away, going bang against one
of the stakes. The men crept close again,
each sparring in what was meant to be a
finished style, till Jones let fly with his left,
but almost out of distance, so that he
barely reached his man. After feeling his
way again, Jones let go, but was stopped
neatly, and in the exchanges that followed
Orme threw in his right heavily on Jones’s
left cheek. There was weight in this blow;
the Young One shook his head as if puzzled,
then went in resolutely. Orme missed his
one, two. A rally followed, during which
Jones hit Orme in the mouth, and received
on the right eye in return. Both rolled
down. In this, his very first round within
the ropes, it was seen that Orme’s favourite
weapon was his right, and that he was a
heavy hitter.</p>

<p>     2 to 6.&mdash;&#8203;These rounds were much alike,
and although there were some sharp exchanges
all through them, they were tedious.
Novices are generally in one extreme or the
other; they either rush at their opponents
as if fights were to be won in a gallop, or else
are ambitious to show how scientific they
are, and so spar and manœuvre without any
definite end in view. The fighting took
place chiefly in Orme’s corner, the length of
arm possessed by Jones forcing his opponent
to retreat; here they manœuvred and
jumped in and out, till at last they got
close, and then staggering counter-hits
would be exchanged. The closes were
scrambling affairs, and generally ended in
the men rolling down together.</p>

</div>

<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pageno">255</span>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Another tedious example of ring
manœuvring, without the skill which makes
such fiddling, squaring, advancing, retreating,
feinting, and shifting tolerable. Both
novices, however, were actuated by a desire
not to throw a chance away; but on a wet
December day a little less generalship and
busier work would have suited the spectators.
The round lasted 27 minutes, but tedious as
it was, it was wound up by a slashing rally,
in which the big ones hit with all their steam.
Jones drew <em>first blood</em> in profusion from Orme’s
nose and mouth, while Harry delivered his
right with tremendous force on Jones’s left
ribs and left eye, badly marking the one
and almost entirely closing the other.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Both slow in answering the call of
time; more than a minute elapsed before
they appeared at the scratch, the heavy
hitting in the last round having told its tale.
Orme, instead of going in and taking advantage
of his weight and power of arm, stood
out and retreated, by advice of his friends.
The round lasted 17 minutes, and at last
was closed by another desperate rally, Jones
improving in his style, and using both hands
well, but the returns of Orme were heaviest
and most effective. Jones threw Orme
cleverly in the close.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Jones jobbed Orme on the nose, and
then on the cheek, but the blows, although
well from the shoulder, left no mark. Orme
seemed remarkably slow in showing contusions,
while Jones was already much disfigured.
Jones forced Orme towards his
corner; Orme rushed forward as Jones
retreated in turn; he let go both left and
right viciously, but was short. Jones lunged
out desperately with his right, and nailing
Orme on the side of the head, knocked him
clean down in the middle of the ring.
(Cheers for the Shrewsbury Youth. First
knock-down for Jones.)</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Orme came up smiling, and as Jones
made himself up for following his supposed
advantage, surprised him by dashing in and
planting his left a smasher on the nose. A
pounding rally followed, in which some
heavy counter-hitting took place, each man
standing well to his gun, until Jones fell
under the ropes.</p>

<p>     For the next fifteen rounds the fighting
grew quicker, the sparring less tedious, and
the rallies more frequent. Jones, taking a
leaf out of his opponent’s book, planted
several slashing hits with his right on the
side of Orme’s head, but being the taller
man, he frequently hit too high, and his
hand, rather than Orme’s hard skull, suffered.
The East-Ender took his punishment
patiently, and was with Jones in nearly all
his attempts, with heavy right-handers on
the left ribs, which gradually impaired the
force of Jones’s hitting, and when they got
closer still, his ponderous right fell on his
cheek-bone or temple, till Jones was nearly
blinded. The Shrewsbury man, however,
was yet as strong as Orme, and was the better
wrestler, for he threw his adversary in
several of these rounds. Towards the 25th
round, however, the repeated right-handers
of Orme began to tell their tale, and Jones
grew slower and weaker. In the last-mentioned
round Orme led off, and hit Jones
sharply in the head, repeating the dose
without a return. Jones attempted to force
a rally, but Orme got down more cleverly
than heretofore. Jones fought with great
fairness, and was much applauded.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Orme showed few marks of punishment,
and was sent up by his seconds very
clean, while Jones grew more disfigured each
round. The men fought somewhat wildly,
but managed to exchange some stinging
counters, which led to a close; but Jones
was now unable to throw his opponent, and
both were down.</p>

<p>     27 to 35.&mdash;&#8203;(Two hours and twenty-nine
minutes had elapsed, and no odds were obtainable;
indeed, it was yet on the cards
for either to win.) Burn called to his man,
Jones, to come away from Orme’s corner,
and let the East-Ender come to him. Jones,
who was evidently distressed, did so, and
the same style of fighting was pursued.
Jones fell from weakness in the 32nd round,
which Orme noting, he forced the fighting
again, and, in the 35th round delivered
several of his slogging hits at close quarters
with such staggering effect that Jones, whose
returns were slight, dropped in the rally.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;The last two or three rounds had
told their tale, and it was evident that Jones’s
chance was fading. (3 to 1 offered on Orme
without takers.) Jones came up as game as
a man could be, and still tried to look cheerful;
but his knees were tottery, and he was
plainly “going.” Orme went to him, forced
another rally, and, after one or two heavy
hits, dropped him with a right-hander.
(“Take him away.”)</p>

<p>     37 and 38.&mdash;&#8203;In each of these rounds Jones
came to the scratch, and made one or two
futile attempts to stop his adversary’s rush,
dropping on his knee on receiving a hit from
Orme.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;Orme paused, as if hesitating to strike
his opponent, who was quite at his mercy.
Jones made a peck at him, and received a
touch on the old spot in the ribs. It was
but a push, yet it sent him to grass sideways.</p>

<p>     40.&mdash;&#8203;Loud cries of “Take him away!”
Jones faced his opponent for the fortieth
time, but he was all abroad. Orme gradually
forced him back into his corner, and
harmlessly sent him down, when Hannan
threw up the sponge in token of Jones’s
defeat.</p>

<p>     The fight lasted two hours and forty-five
minutes, including several tedious rounds,
and much useless breaking ground, advancing,
and retreating. It was, nevertheless, a
truly hard fight, and the two powerful boxers
who made their <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</span> on this occasion inflicted
severe mutual punishment. It was
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pageno">256</span>
manifest, early in the battle, that Orme was
the more lasting of the two, and much the
heavier hitter. It seemed, also, that Jones
had commenced his career too early.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Each man proved himself thorough game, and possessed of undoubted
stamina. Orme, in beating a man taller, longer in the reach, a shade
heavier, and much the favourite in the betting, had done all expected of
him, and his friends resolved on quietly biding their time, and&mdash;&#8203;when that
time did come&mdash;&#8203;on playing for a good stake. Their confidence in their
champion was shown by the character of the next antagonist selected for
him being no other than Nat Langham, whose fame already stood high
among the few who had an opportunity of judging of his merits.</p>

<p>Orme’s <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’essai</span> having proved eminently satisfactory, and Master
Nat having been waiting in vain for a suitable customer from the day
when he defeated Sparkes the Australian, as related in the previous chapter,
a match was proposed for £50 a side, to be decided on the 6th day of
May, 1851. A trip down the river being agreed on, “The Queen of the
Thames” was the vessel engaged, and the oft-described voyage having
been effected at two o’clock, the ring was pitched by Ould Tom Oliver,
Tom Callas, and assistants. At three Orme tossed in his cap, and Langham
followed his example. The usual ridiculous haggling with regard to
a referee ensued, during which we adjourned to another part of the marsh,
where a merry little mill between an Israelite and a son of Ishmael, in the
person of a gipsy lad, which had been arranged for decision on this occasion,
came off. The Hebrew was worsted after a stubborn resistance.
This settled, we returned to the legitimate roped quadrangle called “the
ring” because it is <em>not</em> round. Here, after positively refusing an arbitration
which carries with its exercise nought but unpleasantness, a veteran
Ring-goer (Old Tom Oliver), with the snows of sixty winters on his head,
accepted the office. At fifteen minutes past four the men were escorted
to the scratch. Orme was esquired by Jemmy Welsh and Jack Grant;
Langham by D’Orsay Turner and Johnny Hannan. The men, at scale,
were stated to be respectively 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 5<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> and 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 2<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>; but upon this
point we have our doubts, Orme appearing upon every point far the heavier
man. Orme had trained upon the Chatham hills, and was as tough-looking
a dark grained bit of stuff as ever was selected by shipwright of
that famed dockyard locality. Langham took his breathings on Newmarket
Heath, and was as fine as any thoroughbred fresh from its gallops.
The betting was now even, Langham for choice. After waiting a
few minutes for a hailstorm, which, according to the precedent of this
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pageno">257</span>
“merry month,” will have its way, at a quarter past four the men stood
up for</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Orme stood firmly, with his
elbows rather high, his fists level and almost
square, and his heavy, thick, round arms in
anything but an elegant position; yet he
loomed big, massive, and formidable, and his
deep chest, matted with coarse black hair, and
complexion of the deepest gipsy brown, gave
an impression of hardihood and enduring
strength. Langham was fine and fair in
skin, clean built, with handsome shoulders
and biceps, good length of reach and active
pins. His attitude was artistic; the left
well up and forward, the right playing
easily across the mark, covering the short
ribs, and ready for stop or delivery. Orme
seemed a little flurried and worked forward,
Langham shifting and retreating before him,
coolly and collectedly. Orme let go his left,
which Langham stopped, and caught Orme
sharply on the cheekbone; Langham followed
Orme on the bustle, and reached him
slightly with the right, when Orme ducked
his head, turned clean round, and rose up
outside the ropes (laughter). Langham
beckoned Orme, who came inside, nodding
his head and smiling. Langham, cautious
and steady, would not lead off. Orme tried
to make his left, but was stopped, and following
it immediately with his right was
out of distance; Langham hit Orme sharply
with the left in a quick exchange, drawing
“first blood” from his mouth and nose.
The men got at it, and fighting was the order
of the round, Orme giving Langham a heavy
body hit, but catching pepper about the
frontispiece. Both down, Langham first,
but with the best of the hitting.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Nat retreating, measuring Orme with
his left, till the latter let fly; pretty counter-hits
with the left, Orme home on Langham’s
cheek, Langham on Orme’s nasal organ,
from which more of the ruby distilled.
Some exchanges of no great moment, Langham
slipping down from his own hit.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Orme stopped Langham’s left neatly
(applause); counters with left, Langham’s
straightest, but did not seem much to
mark Orme’s cast-iron nob. Orme bored in,
pegging away; Langham propped him, but
dropped when forced to the ropes.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Orme made several feints, Langham
shifted and laughed; Langham tried to
draw his man, but the latter, advised by
Welsh, pointed to the scratch. Langham
tried his left, but Orme was with him, and,
after some heavy weaving work, Langham
fell because it suited him.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Sparring; Langham cautious but
lively. Orme had found that he got pepper
whenever he attempted to lead off, and he
paused awhile. There was some little chaff
about each man having something in his
hands, and they were shown to be empty.
The mill recommenced by Langham rattling
in one, two, catching Orme on the nose and
ribs; in the scramble Langham was down.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Nat visited Orme’s left eye a stinger,
raising a “mouse.” Orme rushed in and
delivered with tremendous half-arm energy;
Langham fought up and was bored down.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Orme rolled in, letting go both hands;
Nat nobbed him, but Orme forced the fun,
and ran Langham to earth.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Orme had got terribly disfigured by
Langham’s retreating shots, but they did
not seem to impair his strength or resolution;
he hit Langham heavily on the ribs
in the rally, but got one, straight as an
arrow, in the nose from Langham’s left; it
was a smasher, and was followed by a lunge
from the right, as he was already on the
stagger, and down he went on his south pole.
(<em>First knock-down far Langham.</em> Great
cheering.)</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Orme came up more steady than was
expected; he hemmed and coughed several
times, as if troubled in the throat, but
played about, waiting for Langham to begin.
Langham led off, and made his left, but
Orme dashed in desperately, and both were
down in the rally. (6 to 4 on Langham.)</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Langham propped Orme on the nose;
Orme hit rather out of distance, and Langham
slipped down.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Rapid exchanges. Langham made
his straight left sharply on Orme’s right eye,
raising a “mouse” to match the left. Orme
got Langham in his arms, and, after a brief
struggle, held him by the crook, forced him
over, and threw him from his hip on his
neck and head, lending his whole weight to
the impetus of his fall. Langham, apparently
stupefied, was picked up, all abroad,
by Jem Turner and Hannan. (Cries of
“It’s all over!”)</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Langham came up loose in the knees
and puzzled, but he had not lost his style.
Orme could not get on to him, and he fell
on the saving suit.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;(“Time.”) Langham fought prettily
on the defensive, but was in evident distress;
indeed, he never entirely shook off
effects of the throw in the previous round
throughout the fight. Orme hit him in the
body, but he was getting down when he received
the blow.</p>

<p>     14, 15, 16.&mdash;&#8203;Langham still merely defensive
but the last a good fighting round.</p>

<p>     17 to 20.&mdash;&#8203;Heavy work; both rather wild.
Langham generally finished the rounds by
getting to grass. (Offers of 3 to 2 on Orme.)</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Punishing exchanges. Nat getting
steadier; Orme gave way a little after a job
or two from Langham’s left. Langham
<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><span class="pageno">258</span>
followed him. After some hard fighting
Orme threw Langham.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;(A claim on account of Orme having
some substance in his hand; it was disproved.)
Ding-dong work, and Langham
down in the hitting.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Orme pursued Langham, determined
not to allow him to recover his wind; hard,
but rather wild hitting, during which Orme
getting close, sent Langham down.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Nat missed his left, Orme stepping
back; Orme put out his tongue. Exchanges,
and Langham fell.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Langham hit Orme several times as
he came in, but could not stop himself from
being bored down.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Langham tried his left twice, but
was not near enough to his man. Orme let
go his left, and Langham dropped. (An
appeal from Orme on the plea that Langham
dropped without a blow.)</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Heavy counters; Orme on Langham’s
jowl; Langham on Orme’s eye, which was
nearly shut up. A rattling round. Nat
got on Orme’s best eye (the right), then on
his note. Orme hammered away, but was
short of distance, except when in-fighting;
a close, and Langham under. (One hour.)</p>

<p>     28, 29.&mdash;&#8203;Exchanges; Langham precise,
and timing his hits, got Orme to a standstill.
When Orme came on again Langham fell.
(Another claim.)</p>

<p>     30, 31.&mdash;&#8203;As before, Langham slipped
down in the hitting. (A claim each round
for Orme.)</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;Orme wild and rushing; Langham
steadied himself, and propped him severely.
Langham fell at the ropes, Orme over him.</p>

<p>     33, 34.&mdash;&#8203;Langham delivered and fell from
his own blows.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;Hard hitting; Orme would not be
denied; Langham got down at the ropes,
and Orme, bending his knee, tried to drop
on him. (An appeal from Langham’s party,
but overruled.)</p>

<p>     36 to 40.&mdash;&#8203;Nat nailed Orme dexterously,
swelling his lips till he resembled the portrait
of the elder Molyneaux. In the 40th
round he got him to a standstill for a few
seconds. (“Where’s your 2 to 1 now?”)
Langham fought cunningly, and got through
the ropes, down.</p>

<p>     41.&mdash;&#8203;Orme’s eye closed; he rushed at
Langham, who dropped, and Orme was
again charged with trying to “knee” him.</p>

<p>     42.&mdash;&#8203;Exchanges; Langham made his left
prettily, but Orme gave him such a sneezer
that he dropped.</p>

<p>     43.&mdash;&#8203;Langham game and clever, but weak.
(80 minutes had elapsed.) In the struggle
at the close Langham was undermost; a
nasty back fall.</p>

<p>     44.&mdash;&#8203;Some sharp work, the men falling
from their own hits, reaching the ground at
the same time.</p>

<p>     45 to 60.&mdash;&#8203;It was wonderful to see how,
round after round, such fighting could be
kept up, Langham still holding the palm
for generalship, straight hitting, and precision,
but wanting strength from repeated
falls. In the 60th round he fell weak. In
the 64th, both men were again down in the
hitting. From the 65th to the 100th round,
time after time, did the men come up with
fluctuating chances, the changes every three
or four rounds being truly surprising. First
Langham got so shaky that every round
seemed his last; then Orme got such straight
props from the shoulder, in return for his
attempts to “go in and finish,” that it
seemed a pity both could not win; several
times he stood still, puzzled, but scorned to
go down, while Langham could not get up
steam enough to seize the advantage and
secure victory. Orme was twice appealed
against, on the ground that he lifted his foot
when Langham was down. We do not
think he either knew or intended to do what
he did. Langham, too, was appealed against
for going down, but the veteran referee
would not have the battle snatched from
such good men by a quibble. In the 100th
round, 2 hours and 34 minutes having expired,
Orme, on being carried to his corner,
communicated to his seconds that he would
fight no more; when the practised eye of
Welsh perceiving that Langham’s head had
dropped on Turner’s shoulder, he revived
his man by the information that his opponent
had “cut it.” Orme went up, but was not
allowed to have it for asking. Langham
showed, and pecked away like a game cock,
though there was no power in his blows.</p>

<p>     102 to 108.&mdash;&#8203;Short rounds, as they well
might be. Langham got a turn in his favour,
for he hit Orme in the last-mentioned round,
and his head dropped when picked up.</p>

<p>     109.&mdash;&#8203;Orme recovered quicker than could
be expected, and again perceived that his
opponent’s plight was no better than his
own: he staggered in, punched away, and
Langham fell.</p>

<p>     110 to 113.&mdash;&#8203;Orme very much abroad, but
still the stronger. Langham fell in the
113th round on the ropes, and Orme upon
him.</p>

<p>     114, 115.&mdash;&#8203;Both game as pebbles; Orme
quite foggy in the optics; Langham staggering,
and instinctively putting out his
left for a pushing hit. (“Take them both
away,” said a bystander. Orme shook his
head, and Langham tried to muster the
ghost of a smile.) The seconds went close
to their men. “It’s all right,” said poor
Langham to Jem Turner. If he thought so
no one else did. After a slight pop with
his left, Orme pushed Langham down, and
fell over him.</p>

<p>     116.&mdash;&#8203;Orme on his knees, and Langham
down anyhow, in a weak rally.</p>

<p>     117th and last.&mdash;&#8203;Langham sent out his
left; Orme stepped back; Langham again
hit out. He evidently did not perceive
what was before him, and coming forward,
from his own blow, fell on both knees and
his hands. His seconds ran up to him, but
<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a><span class="pageno">259</span>
it was all over. Orme stood in his corner
for a few seconds, when time was called, to
which the Leicester man was yet deaf, walked
slowly across the ring, and taking the hand
of his brave, fallen adversary, tried to muster
an expression of admiration at his
bravery. The sponge had before gone up
from Langham’s corner, and thus, at the
close of <em>two hours and forty-six minutes</em>, was
brought to a decision one of the gamest battles
the modern annals of the Ring can
boast.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>The shades of evening were closing in as the voyagers got on board
their respective steamers, many more, as is usual on such occasions, extending
their patronage to the “men’s” peculiar boat on the upward
voyage than came down by that conveyance; for the very obvious reason
that as the voyage both ways was paid at starting, the disagreeable ceremony
of paying would be insisted on, while having once got down by a
Gravesender, tug, or other cheap conveyance, the homeward-bound voyage
could be effected <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">gratis</span>. It was nearly midnight when the “Queen of the
Thames,” working against tide and a head wind, reached London Bridge;
the voyage being shortened by many an anecdote of brave battles in bygone
days, with which all agreed the present mill might well bear a comparison.</p>

<p>Orme now rested for a year upon his well-earned laurels, when once again
Aaron Jones, who during the interval of two years had, so rumour averred,
wonderfully developed and immensely improved in the art, sought to reverse
the verdict given against him in December, 1849. Aaron had, moreover,
in the interim fought Bob Wade (the Dover Champion), a 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> man,
whom he defeated at Edenbridge, Kent, in one hour, in which forty-three
punishing rounds were contested.</p>

<p>Monday, May 10th, 1852, was the fixture, instead of the customary
Tuesday; the moving reason thereto being that the Turfites, among whom
were Jones’s prominent patrons, might attend another “ring” at Newmarket
on the latter day. On Jones’s improvement the Sporting Oracle
thus delivered itself: “When Jones first contended with Orme he was a
youth of eighteen, weighing 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 2<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, and too young to bear the wear
and tear of a long encounter. He has now increased in height and weight,
stands 6 feet in height, and will draw a trifle over 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, besides having
materially improved in the pugilistic art.” At the last deposit of £10 a side,
making up the stakes to £200, which took place on Tuesday last at Mr.
Prior’s, “Nag’s Head,” South Audley Street, Jones had the call in the
betting, his friends being West-enders and ready to back their own “stable.”
As the rendezvous was in the vicinity of Newmarket, and a trip per
Eastern Counties rail the mode of reaching the field of arms, we were glad,
on presenting ourselves at the Shoreditch terminus at eight o’clock, to see at
“the meet,” not only a large number of the Corinthian patrons of the
<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pageno">260</span>
Ring, whose faces we have for some time missed from such gatherings, but
many of the ex-professors of the art&mdash;&#8203;Owen Swift, Adams, Jem Burn,
Shaw, Dan Pinxton, Jemmy Gardner, Alec Keene, Harry Milbourn, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. At a little before eight Jones arrived at the station, accompanied by
the lively Bob Fuller and Alec Keene; the former being his trainer and the
twain his selected seconds for the fistic duello. Jones looked remarkably
bright and well, indeed, as Bob expressed it, he was “as fit as a fiddle,” and
“would take a great deal of beating.” Orme did not put in an appearance
at Shoreditch, but it was quickly made known that he had departed overnight
for the neighbourhood of Newmarket, where he was awaiting the
arrival of the “London particulars.” At a few minutes past eight the
whistle sounded, and off we went, understanding that Chesterford, where
we were told Orme awaited us, was our calling-place, and thence we should
be conveyed to Mildenhall. This was a judicious ruse, but, as we shall
presently see, failed in the trial. On arriving at Chesterford, however, our
steam-steed merely took a drink of water, and sped on its way to Six Mile
Bottom, on the Newmarket line. We must confess that we were a little
staggered, knowing what we did of the Cambridge authorities, that the
“managers” should have chosen their ground within that shire, and we
argued that as one of the men had been training near the racing metropolis
the watchful blues had doubtless an eye upon his movements.</p>

<p>On mentioning our misgivings, however, to some of the parties concerned,
and expressing our surprise that so hazardous an attempt should be made,
we were assured that it was all right, that there were no magistrates
within call, and that the fight was certain to be settled without interruption.
While waiting for the arrival of Orme, our fears for the result
were verified to the fullest extent by the appearance of a body of Cambridge
police, both horse and foot, evidently determined to spoil sport. It
was now determined to go on to Newmarket at once to fetch Orme, who
had prudently retreated into the town on finding that the enemy was in
the field. At Newmarket it was stated that he had chartered a fly, and
was about to proceed across country to Mildenhall. A despatch was instantly
sent to recall him, and, after a delay of about half an hour, he
made his appearance, looking big, brown, hardy, and confident. He immediately
took his place in the train, and an inhabitant of the district having
intimated that he knew a spot where there was no chance of interruption,
consented to act as pilot, the train was once more put in motion,
and taking its course up the old Newmarket line, which was at that time
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pageno">261</span>
closed for general traffic, was brought to a standstill by the side of a
field at Bourne Bridge, a place rendered memorable as the scene of the
first contest between Mr. Gully and Gregson, in days long vanished,
passed away. Here a debarkation was effected, and when all the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageurs</span>
by train were collected there were certainly not more than two hundred
persons present. These, by the time the ropes and stakes were pitched,
were increased by the arrival of some dozen equestrians from Cambridge
and Newmarket, anxious, no doubt, to enjoy a treat so seldom witnessed
by the inhabitants of those celebrated universities for the education of man
and horse; but, as will be shortly seen, their arrival on horseback defeated
the object they had in view, as it served to put the blues upon the scent,
and enabled them, before much business had been got through, again to
put in their unwelcome appearance, and once more to send the “peace
breakers” to the right about.</p>

<p>On the recommendation of “the pilot” the business of constructing the
arena was set about with unusual celerity by young Fred Oliver and the
veteran Tom Callas, under the superintendence of the ancient Commissary
himself, and by a few minutes past one o’clock all was in readiness. A
capital outer ring was formed, round which the “cheapsiders” took their
stations, while comfortable straw hassocks were provided for the tenants of
the inner circle who chose to pay the price demanded by those who had
been so thoughtful as to provide such luxuries. Jem Burn, whose hind
feet and legs were not sufficiently under his command to enable him to
take up a position so close to mother-earth, was accommodated with a
chair, around which were grouped several of his ancient patrons, and all
appeared now to be satisfied that at length fortune was favourable, and
that the mill would be brought to a conclusion without let or hindrance.
Umpires and a referee were quickly chosen, and the men at once proceeded
to their toilettes, Jones, as we have already stated, being waited on by Bob
Fuller and Alec Keene, while Orme had for valets Jemmy Welsh and a
“Jolly Butcher” from Southwark. On stripping, Jones confirmed the
opinion we had formed in the morning, that he was as “fine as a star,”
and as fit as Fuller could make him. Orme, on denuding himself of his
outer rind, looked big enough and strong enough for anything. His skin,
of a nut-brown tint, gave him altogether an appearance of hardihood which
lead a spectator to infer that he was an adversary by no means to be
sneezed at, even by those who considered themselves his superiors in the
fistic art. It was clear, nevertheless, that he had not devoted quite as
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pageno">262</span>
much time to his preparation as the nature of the encounter he had undertaken
would have justified. There were indications of loose flesh about
his ribs and chest which might have been well dispensed with. On inquiring
his weight we were informed that he was about 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, being just 4<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>
more than when he encountered Langham. Notwithstanding this exuberance
of meat he looked remarkably well, was extremely confident, and
“eager for th’ affray.” All being at length in readiness, the colours (blue
for Orme, and yellow with blue border for Jones) were nailed to the mast&mdash;&#8203;we
mean, tied to the stake. Orme laid his adversary a bet of £25 to £20,
which was duly posted. The men and their seconds shook hands&mdash;&#8203;silence
was proclaimed&mdash;&#8203;“Time” was called (half-past one)&mdash;&#8203;the seconds retired
to their corners, and left the men at the scratch to commence</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On throwing themselves into
attitude, which, as the dandies say, “is
everything,” there was no very great display
of artistic skill on either side. If anything,
Jones’s position was the more graceful
of the two; still he left his ribs totally
unprotected, and held his hands much too
far from his body to please our mind. Orme,
on the contrary, held his arms, which loomed
large and ponderous, closer to his corpus.
He stood almost square, his thick, muscular
legs seeming well calculated to support his
enormous round shoulders, which resembled
those of a miniature Atlas. Jones, after a
dodge or two, feinted with his left, but Orme
grinned and stepped back; Jones followed him
up, when Orme stopped his further progress
with a prop from his right on the side of
the head. Counter-hits with the left followed
without any mischief. Orme then
swung round his right as if it was a sledgehammer,
and caught Jones with tremendous
force on the ribs under the left arm, in the
region of the heart, where he left most unmistakable
imprints of his knuckles, which
never disappeared during the remainder of
the battle. Jones returned slightly on the
right ear, which led to a rally, in which Orme
had the best of the hitting, again delivering
a rib-bender with his right, removing the
bark from Jones’s smeller, and drawing
<em>first blood</em> with his left. A close, in which
Orme held his man tight, and fibbed him on
the nose and forehead until both were down
in Jones’s corner.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Jones led off with his left, reaching
Orme’s cheek, and cleverly stopping the
return. Counter-hits followed, Jones drawing
claret from Orme’s mouth, catching it
in return heavily on the cheek and chin.
Some slogging hits were exchanged without
any regard to science, and Jones at length
slipped down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Jones again led off with his left, but
was very wild in his deliveries, which passed
over Orme’s shoulder. Had he been more
precise his blows would have told a tale, for
Orme appeared to think that “stopping”
was quite beneath him. Orme went in,
pegged away left and right on the left eye
and ribs, and Jones fell.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Jones on coming up displayed the
marks of Orme’s handiwork in the last round
in the shape of a mouse on his left eye. He
appeared loth to come out of his corner,
whereupon Orme went to him. Jones retreated
as far as he could, and delivered his
left as Orme came in. Orme “stopped the
blow” with his left cheek, returned the compliment
with interest by two heavy cracks
on Jones’s injured peeper and his forehead,
when Jones got down.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Orme commenced business by rushing
in and planting his left and right heavily
on Jones’s mouth and nose, drawing more
claret. Jones returned slightly on the left
cheek and slipped down just as Orme was
about to effect a delivery. He looked up as
if anticipating a <em>foul</em>, but Orme restrained
himself, grinned, shook his head, patted
Jones on the back of his poll, and walked to
his corner.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Jones led off with his left, catching
Orme on the potato-trap. Orme countered
him on the nose heavily, stepped back again,
went in, repeated the dose on Jones’s nose
and his left eye, and the latter was again
down.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Jones came up much flushed, bleeding
from the nose and left eye. His forehead
was swelled, and altogether it was evident
that Orme’s visitations had not been without
their effect. The only mark Orme
showed was a swelling under his left eye.
Orme led off, caught Jones another rattler
on the damaged ogle, drawing more of the
<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pageno">263</span>
ruby. Jones wild, dashed in, planted a
heavy blow on Orme’s left cheek, and fell
on his latter end from the force of his own
blow.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Jones stopped Orme’s left neatly, and
tried a return which was short. A rally
followed, in which Jones’s deliveries were
mostly thrown away, inasmuch as they
passed over Orme’s shoulder. Orme, whose
punches, although very round, in general
got home, again planted on Jones’s left eye
and nose. At length Jones got one on
Orme’s left peeper, drawing blood, and then
slipped down.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Jones came up bleeding, and looking
much the worse for wear, while Orme was
all confidence. Jones led off with his left,
got home slightly on Orme’s smeller, when
suddenly was heard the unwelcome watchword
of “Police”&mdash;&#8203;and sure enough, on
looking round we perceived a detachment of
neatly attired Cambridge “Peelers” making
their way to the field of action. A cry of
sauve qui peut was instantly raised, and the
ground was cleared in a trice, every one
making for the train and jumping into the
first carriage that he could find open. It
was soon discovered, however, that the object
of the “powers that be” was not to
apprehend any of the wrongdoers, but
merely to prevent a breach of the peace in
the county of Cambridge.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>A council of war was called; the referee, whose duty it was to name
the next time and place, if possible on the same day, suggested that there
was yet time to go to Mildenhall, where he knew the matter could be concluded
in peace. The officials, however, connected with the railway, said
that, inasmuch as the train would have to return up the old Newmarket
line, and then go round by Cambridge, where it would be detained so as
not to interfere with the general traffic, it was very probable that Mildenhall
could not be reached in time to finish the business in hand before
dark. It was then hinted by “the pilot” that the affair might be completed
in the neighbourhood of Newmarket, that town being in the county of
Suffolk, and out of the jurisdiction of the Cambridgeshire authorities.
The plan appeared feasible, and “bock agin” to Newmarket was the order
of the day. The pilot conducted the Commissary and assistants to a likely
piece of turf behind the plantation of firs at the top of the training-ground,
not much more than a mile from the town, and here a second ring was
formed with all due diligence, and here, of course, the crowd of spectators
was largely increased by detachments of lovers of the sport from the town
itself and the surrounding districts. At twenty-two minutes after three,
all being for the second time in readiness, in the midst of a shower of rain,
round nine was resumed.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT RESUMED.</p>

<p>Round 9 continued.&mdash;&#8203;On the men throwing
off their blankets both looked rather the
worse for wear, Jones having a most unmistakable
black eye, and the bark being off
his frontispiece in several places. The marks
also of Orme’s hammerings on his ribs were
very apparent. Orme displayed a slight
swelling and discolouration under his left
eye, and an enlargement of his upper lip.
Both seemed fresher from the rest they had
taken, and appeared anxious now to finish
the fight out of hand. Jones led off twice,
but was short. Orme then delivered a spank
on his left eye. Jones returned rather
heavily on the nose and slipped down.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Orme led off, planted his right again
heavily on the ribs. Jones, after one or two
wild plunges over his adversary’s shoulder,
succeeded in reaching his damaged cheek,
and slipped down.
</p>
<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pageno">264</span>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Jones again led off twice with his left,
but in both instances the blows fell short;
Orme then went to his man, slight taps were
exchanged, after which Orme popped in a
nasty one on the nose, and slipped down.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Orme rushed in to fight, but Jones
stepped back, caught him heavily on the left
ear and left eye, drawing claret from the
latter; Orme tried to return, but Jones got
down cunning.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Orme on coming to the scratch showed
that Jones’s last two hits had not been without
their effect; his left ogle began to show
symptoms of shutting up shop, while his left
ear was considerably discoloured. Jones led
off, delivered his left and right on Orme’s
injured optic and his ear, stopped Orme’s
returns cleverly, and slipped down.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Orme rushed in in a determined
manner, but was again stopped. Jones
stepped back, delivered his right on Orme’s
left ear heavily; Orme would not be stalled
off, but again bored in, when Jones slipped
down.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Jones led off, but the blow passed
harmless over Orme’s head; good counter-hits
followed, Orme delivering on Jones’s
nose, and receiving a heavy visitation on his
right peeper. Jones then received a one-two
on the nose and ribs, when both got down
together, and, after a slight scramble, were
down side by side.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Jones was again short in his deliveries,
when Orme closed, and both were again
down, no mischief being done.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Both rattled in to their work, and
some sharp exchanges took place, in which
Jack was as good as his master. Orme then
caught Jones round the neck, fibbed him
heavily in the mouth and nose, and after a
short struggle threw him heavily, and fell
upon him.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Jones, led off, his arm passing over
his adversary’s head. He was more lucky in
a second attempt, reaching Orme’s left ogle
heavily. Some rattling exchanges followed,
left and right, Jones catching it on the ribs
and left eye, while he got home heavily on
Orme’s ear, mouth, and left cheek. Orme
bored in, planted his one-two on Jones’s nose
and mouth, and was trying to improve his
advantage when Jones slipped down cunning.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Jones first to fight, Orme appearing
to blow from want of condition. Jones got
home again on the left ear and nose; Orme
returned slightly, but his hits now appeared
to lack steam. Jones in this round rattled
away in style, had all the best of the hitting,
but in the end Orme counterbalanced these
advantages by closing and throwing him a
cross buttock, and falling heavily on him.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Jones led off, but was met by Orme
with a sharp counter-hit, each reached his
adversary’s left eye, after which Jones immediately
got down. He had evidently been
much shaken by the fall in the previous
round.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Orme attempted to take the lead, but
was short; Jones delivered a heavy right-hander
on the left ear; counter-hits followed,
Orme reaching Jones’s left eye heavily, and
received on the nose. Jones finished the
round by delivering a spank on Orme’s right
eye and getting down.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Jones came up, bleeding from his left
eye. Orme opened the ball by repeating the
dose on the same optic, and drawing a fresh
supply of the ruby. He attempted to do
ditto ditto, but was cleverly stopped by
Jones. Counter-hits followed, Orme succeeding
in again planting upon the nearly
closed eye of his adversary, who delivered on
the left cheek and left ear and then got
down.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Jones attempted to take the lead,
but was wofully short. Orme went to him,
delivered his left and right heavily, received
a slight tap in return, and Jones fell.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>It was now forty minutes past three, and before time could be called for
the next round, “police!” was again the cry of the multitude&mdash;&#8203;a cry which,
as at the first ring, proved to be only too true. Several individuals, clad
in blue array, connected with the Suffolk constabulary, forced their way to
the arena, and ordered the combatants to desist in the Queen’s name. A
fly was close to the spot, and in this both men and their seconds quickly
ensconced themselves. The stakes were once more drawn, and all repaired
to the railway station, to once more ponder upon the reverses of a day
which had dawned with every prospect of a successful expedition. The backers
of the men applied to the referee to know his decision, and that functionary,
after considering the circumstances of the case, decided that there must
be another meeting, and, having taken council with the pilot, the excursionists
<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pageno">265</span>
once more re-entered the train, the pilot and a backer of Orme
taking their station on the tender, the former undertaking to direct the engine
driver to a spot where it was thought a satisfactory last act might be
appended to the two which had already been performed. The train once
more flew past Six Mile Bottom, where the blue-coated fraternity were still
observable on the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</span>, to prevent a second invasion of their bailiwick.
The old Newmarket line was a second time traversed for some miles, and at
length the pilot gave orders to “heave to” at a field of clover, about two
miles on the Newmarket side of Chesterford. And now comes the unpleasant
part of our narrative. On the referee leaving the train, he was asked by
some of Jones’s backers why the train had stopped, as they understood he
had decided that the fight was to be postponed until another day. The
referee stated that he had given no decision of the kind; the articles specified
that in case of magisterial interference the referee was to name the
next time and place, if possible on the same day. He had named a place
(having directed the engine driver under the orders of “the pilot” to go
where there was a probability of a satisfactory conclusion); that place had
been reached, there was plenty of daylight, he saw no excuse for postponing
the battle to a future day, and he had no alternative but to order the men
to fight. Jones’s friends replied that Orme’s principal backer had told them
when the police arrived at the second ring that there would be no more
fight that day, but that he should take his man back to London at once.
They had therefore given Jones oranges to eat, and brandy-and-water to
drink, and had, moreover, been smoking in the same carriage with him.
The referee stated that this, if it was the case, was highly reprehensible on
their part; Orme’s backers had no power to decide whether the fight was
to be resumed or not; that was discretionary on his (the referee’s) part.
He had stated to one or two of Jones’s friends what his intentions were, and
if there had been any doubt upon the point, the least that could have been
done by his seconds and attendants would have been to ask the question
before they allowed their man to commit the excesses they alluded to. It
was then urged by Jones’s backers that it would be a cruel thing to order
the men to fight again after being twice stripped and twice disturbed. The
referee said that might or might not be the case; his duty, according to the
articles, was imperative. The men must fight, unless they chose mutually
to agree to a postponement, when of course he could have no objection.
Orme and his friends would not hear of an adjournment, and wished to
have the matter decided at once. Jones’s backers then became very excited,
<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><span class="pageno">266</span>
and one of them applied language to the referee which was utterly unjustifiable,
and that gentleman said he would have nothing more to do with the
matter, and that he would resign his office as referee. After a lengthened
argument <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em>, however, the referee, seeing that if he resigned his
office the friends of Jones would attain the object they evidently had in
view&mdash;&#8203;namely, to save any bets they might have upon the fight, by refusing
to agree to any other referee, and thus procuring an adjournment&mdash;&#8203;consented
to leave the railway carriage into which he had retired. He was
again begged by Jones’s friends to adjourn the fight, but again repeated his
decision that they must make another attempt on that day to bring the
affair to an issue. Jones and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> appeared still reluctant to renew the
encounter, whereupon the referee stated that he would give them half an
hour, and if Jones was not in the ring ready to fight by that time he would
award the stakes to Orme. Orme went to the ring, which had already
been formed, whither he was followed, after a short delay, by Jones and
his seconds. Jones, whose left eye was completely closed, and who showed
other symptoms of severe chastisement, pulled off his trousers and coat, and
was about to denude himself of his other clothing, when suddenly he
appeared to change his mind; he whispered to one of his seconds that it
was “No use his fighting any more, as he was sure to be licked.” He then
resumed his extra toggery and went to the referee, to whom he stated that
he would not fight again unless another referee was chosen, as he had
resigned his office. The referee replied that his resignation was only
threatened, and was not consummated, inasmuch as it had not been accepted
by the parties concerned, who had asked him (after he had said that he
would resign) to adjourn the fight to another day, and had thus acknowledged
his authority. He was not disposed now to give up that authority,
and thus deprive Orme of any chance he might have of finishing the battle
that night. He did not consider that either man was licked, or that there
was any great advantage on either side in point of punishment; there were
still two hours of daylight. As he had said before, he could see no ground
for a postponement, and fight they must, or he would certainly award the
battle in favour of Orme. Jones still persisted in his refusal to fight, and
at length left the ring, repeating the observation, that if he fought again
he knew he should be licked. He did not leave the arena, however, without
hearing sundry complimentary speeches from the spectators upon the
courage (?) he displayed in refusing to finish the battle in a manly, upright
manner, and without resorting to any petty subterfuges to obtain an
<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a><span class="pageno">267</span>
adjournment. Amongst others who commented in strong terms upon his
behaviour was Jemmy Massey, who was backing him, and who has shown
himself a pretty good judge of the quantity of punishment a man can take
without being licked; Jemmy strongly advised Jones to at once leave the
ring, acknowledge that he was afraid of Orme, and thus end the matter.
The referee waited the promised half-hour, at the end of which time, finding
that Jones still declined the contest, he awarded the victory to Orme, to
whom he at once handed the sum of £45, being the bet of £25 to £20
which had been laid prior to the commencement of the fight. The battle
lasted 15 minutes at Bourne Bridge, and 18 minutes at Newmarket&mdash;&#8203;total
33 minutes.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p>  <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Few remarks are called for
upon the style displayed by either of the
combatants in this most unsatisfactory
affair. Orme displayed all that fearless determination
to do or die which has characterised
his former encounters, but we could
not perceive any improvement in his scientific
acquirements since his battle with
Nat Langham last year. His principal notion
of stopping seemed to be with his head,
which consequently received many sharp visitations
from Jones’s wild deliveries, which
a very little care would have enabled him
entirely to escape. The art of getting away
seemed to be one to the study of which he
has paid very little attention. His game
evidently is “nothing venture, nothing
gain,” and he acted up to this to the fullest
extent. Notwithstanding his want of skilful
direction of his undoubted powers, Orme
is a dangerous customer to any one at all
near his weight. He is a very hard hitter,
an extremely powerful and determined man,
of indomitable courage, and, although his
powers as a receiver were not severely
tested on the present occasion, still, it is
known that in his fight with Langham he
showed that his qualities as a glutton are of
the highest order. He is, moreover, possessed
of an excellent temper, which enables
him to control himself under circumstances
which are calculated sometimes to “ruffle
the feathers” of the coolest combatant. As
to Jones, in whom we were taught to expect
a most wonderful alteration for the better,
we can only say that our expectations were
grievously disappointed. He certainly
did stop Orme’s swinging right-handers
occasionally, but his returns, which from
the opening afforded to him might have enabled
him to punish his daring adversary’s
temerity in a most signal manner, were
mostly thrown to the winds. The tremendous
blow he received on the ribs in the
very first round appeared to take a good
deal of the fight out of him, and it was with
extreme caution that he trusted himself
within reach of Orme’s pile-driving visitations.
In the first ring, indeed, after the
first round, he did little but receive what
Orme could give, and on arriving at the
second arena, previous to recommencing operations,
it appeared to us that there was some
little difficulty on the part of his seconds in
persuading him that there was a chance left
for him to snatch the laurel of victory from
his more hardy opponent. When he did begin,
however, he proved that he could fight
very well if he chose, and that what he
might lack in strength could be fully counterbalanced
by steadiness; for whenever he
collected himself and made up his mind to
be with his man, the hits were pretty equally
balanced, both as regarded their severity
and their number. The fall which he received
in the second act, to which was superadded
the weight of Orme’s carcase, however,
seemed again to take a good deal of
fight out of him, and it was pretty evident
to all, that although Orme was not likely to
gain a victory without receiving a very
considerable amount of punishment, still,
barring an accident, victory must ultimately
be his. The conduct of Jones at the third
ring proved either that his heart was composed
of a softer material than is necessary
to render a man a successful bruiser,
or that he acted under advice which, however
well intended, was certainly as ill-timed
as it was injudicious. We know that his
seconds did all they could to endeavour to
persuade him to fight, but finding that he
was obviously disinclined, they, like clever
counsellors, did their best for their client
in trying to convert a bad cause into a good
one, and obtain an adjournment to a future
day; but, as has already been seen, the fiat
had gone forth. Their man had but to choose
one of two alternatives&mdash;&#8203;<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, to fight or lose
the battle, and he, doubtless feeling assured
in his own mind that the latter course would
be the safer, declined to have any more,
withdrew from the ring, leaving behind him
a reputation little creditable to him as a
<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><span class="pageno">268</span>
man of courage, and little calculated to raise
him in the opinion of those Corinthians who
were prepared to witness a manly struggle
for pre-eminence, without any of those paltry
shifts and subterfuge which appear now to
be almost necessary concomitants of every
encounter.</p>

<p>As was to be expected, the stakeholder received a legal notice from the
backers of Jones, not to part with their portion of the money deposited.
Nevertheless, on the Monday following, that gentleman handed over the
£200 to Orme, pursuant to the decision of the referee. The stakeholder,
in giving the money to Orme, animadverted severely on the conduct of
the backers of Jones, which he characterised as unsportsmanlike and ill-judged.
Such conduct was calculated to lower the already fallen fortunes
of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, and unless measures were taken to make an example of persons
who could so far forget themselves, he feared that gentlemen would in
future be deterred from putting down money to back men, from the fear
that the backers of the opposing party would, if they found their man was
getting the worst of it, take every unfair means in their power to prevent
a manly and upright termination to the contest. On the present occasion
two of Jones’s friends and supporters (whom he named) had, but whether
with Jones’s consent he was unable to say, served him (the stakeholder)
with a legal notice not to part with the money they had placed in
his hands. Not feeling disposed to permit Orme to be thus deprived of a
sum to which he had fairly entitled himself, he communicated the fact to
the gentleman who staked the greater part of his money, and that gentle-
and Orme executed a bond of indemnity to hold him (the stakeholder)
harmless, in case Messrs. Ledger and Prior should take any further steps.
The law expenses attending this bond of indemnity amounted to nearly £6.
This sum would have to be paid by Orme, and it would make a considerable
reduction in the amount of his winnings, which were already sufficiently
circumscribed by the expenses incurred for training, paying his
seconds, <abbr title="et cetera, et cetera">&amp;c., &amp;c.</abbr> He felt assured that all persons who were disposed to
look at the result of the contest in a proper light would agree with the
referee in the decision he had given, and in this opinion he was upheld by
remarks which had come to his ears, which had been made on the ground,
by persons who had lost their money by backing Jones, many of whom
said that the referee could not do otherwise than he had done. It was
not necessary to trouble the company with any further remarks; they would
form their own estimate of the proceedings of Jones and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>; and in conclusion
he was sure they would cordially agree with him in wishing that
when Orme was again matched he would be more lucky in the choice of an
<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pageno">269</span>
opponent. It was certain that whenever he did fight again he would do
his best to win, and it would be from no lack of determination on his part
if he lost. The stakeholder then handed to Orme the £200, minus
£5 17s. 4d., the amount of the lawyer’s bill for preparing the bond of
indemnity.</p>

<p>Orme expressed his thanks to the stakeholder for his determination in
giving up the money. He said it was usual, when the winning man
received the reward of his victory, to present the loser with something as a
compensation for his disappointment. It had been his intention to act up
to the custom on the present occasion, and give Jones a £5 note, if his
(Jones’s) backers had not acted in such an unsportsmanlike manner. They
had, however, put him to an expense of nearly £6, and this so reduced his
winnings that he really could not afford to give anything. He was sorry
for this, on Jones’s account, as he did not believe that he had any hand in
the legal proceedings. Although he could not himself afford to do anything
for Jones, however, he would make a collection among his friends.</p>

<p>Orme’s determination to give nothing to Jones was applauded by the
parties present, who expressed their opinion that this was the true method
of punishing him for any countenance he might have given to the dealing
with the lawyers which had been commenced by his friends. Orme then
went round the room, and made a collection for Jones. This he handed
over to Jones, who immediately rose and thanked the company. He assured
them that he had nothing to do with the notice served upon the stakeholder,
and all he could say was, he hoped when he fought again he should get a
better character from the Press than he had received on the present occasion.
He was no coward, and he trusted that the day would come when he
might be able to prove himself as game a man as Orme. As to the amount
subscribed for him, he thought he could not do better than hand it over to
the stakeholder, to be appropriated towards Spring’s monument. Jones’s
speech was much applauded, and he sat down amidst considerable cheering,
and the remainder of the evening passed off harmoniously.</p>

<p>Orme’s second victory over Aaron Jones, who, as must not be forgotten,
was at this period (1852&ndash;3) looked upon by the Broomes and many good
judges as the “coming man” for the championship <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">in futuro</span>, marked him
out as a boxer who in time to come must “give away weight,” and who
was not to be tackled by any middle-weight; for the phenomenon of a ten-and-a-half
stone Champion had not yet presented itself to men’s eyes, or to
their minds as a possibility or even a probability. At this juncture the
<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a><span class="pageno">270</span>
Champion’s title had passed into the hands of Harry Broome, in consequence
of his very debatable conquest of the “Old Tipton” (through a
foul blow), on the 27th of September, 1851, at Mildenhall, Suffolk. From
that time Harry Broome had worn the title undisputed (Aaron Jones
being of the Broome party), but now the East End friends of Orme thought
they perceived their Champion within a “measurable distance” of the
Championship. Accordingly Harry Orme, with laudable ambition, picked
up the gauntlet thrown down by the Champion, the “other Harry,” and
agreeing to the amount of stake, £500, articles were drawn, and the 23rd of
March, 1853, fixed for its decision; owing, however, to that being the day of
the Newmarket Handicap, a supplemental agreement was signed, postponing
the battle to Monday, 18th of April. We need not here recapitulate the
circumstances of the battle, seeing that they are minutely detailed in the
Memoir of <span class="sc">Harry Broome</span>, Chapter <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr> of this volume.</p>

<p>With this “glorious defeat,” more honourable to the loser than many
victories, we close the Ring career of the brave, honest, and straightforward
Harry Orme. We shall conclude our Ring memoirs of this courageous
champion by a few words of quotation from a contemporary account of
this final fight: “Orme is a remarkably quiet, civil fellow, and is much
respected by his friends at the East End, and, indeed, by all who intimately
know him. He is a man who never talks about fighting, except
in the briefest terms, and then only when he means business. We do not
ever recollect hearing from his lips, either at home or in public, any of that
slang or loose talk which many of his brother professionals consider witty,
or smart, and laughter-provoking. In fact, Harry Orme is singularly
modest, and not only avoids boasting, but is always ready to concede
credit to his opponent, and leave to others the praising of himself.”</p>

<p>Harry Orme was for many years known as the landlord of the “Jane
Shore,” in Shoreditch. He died on the 9th of June, 1864, in his 41st
year, and rests beneath a neat memorial in Abney Cemetery.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">TOM PADDOCK.<br />
1844&ndash;1860.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">In</span> the little world as in the great, “history never tires of repeating itself,”
according to the Napoleonic axiom; and so in the period in which the
rustic, ruddy, round-boned, pugnacious Tom Paddock flourished his fists,
the interregnum of the Ring exhibited a parallel to our ancient Heptarchy,
the combats of which were compared by David Hume, the historian, to
“the battles of the kites and the crows.” Big Ben Caunt, the crafty
Bendigo (William Thompson, of Nottingham), Tom Paddock (of Redditch),
Con Parker (for a few months), the Tipton Slasher (William Perry), and,
finally, Harry Orme and Harry Broome, bandied and buffeted about the
title of “Champion of England,” until the scarcity of “good men”
reminded us of the lines of Juvenal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

   <div class="i0a">“Good men are scarce, indeed so thinly sown,</div>

<p class="unindent">and so went on the “confusion in the camp” until little Tom Sayers came,
and, by disposing of Perry and Paddock, united England in one “Championship
of all the weights.”</p>

<p>Paddock’s claims to a niche in our gallery of celebrities are indisputable,
as it was his lot to encounter almost every big man of repute in his day.
He fought, as we shall see, Nobby Clarke (twice), Bendigo, Harry Poulson
(three times), Aaron Jones (twice), Harry Broome, the Tipton Slasher,
Tom Sayers, and Sam Hurst. With this anticipation of his career we will
proceed to a more detailed account of the doings of the “Redditch needlepointer”
than has been hitherto given; merely noting that this nickname,
which we many times heard from his intimates and other provincials, seemed
<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><span class="pageno">272</span>
rather derived from the staple trade of Paddock’s native town than from
any employment at “needlemaking” by the burly Tom himself, who was but
slightly polished up from a rough and ready rustic chawbacon by his fourteen
years of incidental town life.</p>

<p>Tom’s birth dated from 1824, and his pursuits, as we have intimated,
were those of a farmer’s boy; indeed, Tom might have lived and died
unknown, and taken his long nap in a nameless grave&mdash;</p>

in the roped lists of the Prize Ring.</p>

<p>On the third day of the last month of the year 1844, a battle was fought
between a brace of rustics, which soon after introduced yet another “Champion”
candidate. The day above-named was a bustling one for the Fancy
of the Hardware Town, there being no less than four fights on the far-famed
battle-ground of Sutton Coldfield. The first of these, between William
Shakespeare (of Brierly Hill) and Tom Jenkins (of Dudley)&mdash;&#8203;in which the
namesake and possible kinsman of that other “Warwickshire lad,” renowned
for all time, got an exemplary thrashing in about half an hour&mdash;&#8203;concerns
us no farther than that the said Jenkins, in January of the same year, had
beaten Elijah Parsons, of whom we shall hear more presently.</p>

</div>

<p>Shakespeare and his conqueror having quitted the stage by the early
hour of half-past eleven, and the Birmingham Commissary having rearranged
his “properties,” the spectators resumed their seats for the second
performance, in which the principal actors were our hero, announced as
“Young Tom Paddock, of Redditch,” and his opponent, “Old Elijah
Parsons, of Tambourne,” a village near Dudley. Parsons, who stood six
feet and weighed 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, was liberally backed by his local friends, he having
in his younger days (he was then thirty) won some very hard battles.
Paddock, who weighed a pound or two under 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, and was in his twentieth
year, had already stripped on one occasion in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, when, at Mapleborough
Green, he defeated Fred Pearce, of Cheltenham, for a purse, after
Sam Simmonds, of Birmingham, had defeated Tom the Greek, on January
29, 1844. The country folk seemed to fancy “Old Elijah,” who for a
fortnight had been under the care and tuition of Nobby Clarke, who, on
this occasion also acted as his second, assisted by Bob Rowley. Ben Terry
<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a><span class="pageno">273</span>
had trained Paddock for the same short period, and now seconded him with
Jem Hodgkiss. Parsons, who was in attire and staidness of demeanour a
counterpart of a field-preacher, sported a white ground kerchief with a small
yellow spot, Paddock the orthodox blue birdseye. Some time was lost,
through local jealousy, in selecting a referee; but that and every other
necessary preliminary settled, at half-past 12 o’clock the business began.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;As the men stood up Parsons
looked big, bony, and formidable, Paddock
round, rosy-red, and blooming with rude
health. After a little rustic dodging and sparring,
both went in right and left. Paddock
succeeded in planting the first hit, a slashing
left-hander on the Old’un’s mouth. Parsons
missed a heavy hit, his right going over
Paddock’s shoulder, who nailed him with a
one, two. Parsons, evidently not knowing
what to make of it, turned half-round and
went from his man. Paddock followed him,
and, hitting up, caught him a tidy smack
with the left; Parsons, swinging completely
round, made a good hit on the side of Paddock’s
head, when they closed, and both
fell. (5 and 6 to 4 offered on Paddock.)</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Parsons came to the scratch looking
serious, with his right eye already damaged
and a bleeding cut on the left cheek-bone.
(First blood claimed for the Young’un.) Parsons
rushed in, chopping away with both
hands, but with little effect. Paddock
propped him, but was first down. (Cries of
“2 to 1 on Redditch!”)</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Parsons’s right eye showing symptoms
of closing. Exchanges, Paddock nailing
Parsons with his right on the damaged cheek,
and Elijah retaliating on his opponent’s ribs.
Both men pegged away at give and take;
in the close, Parsons bored Paddock down.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Parsons tried to force the fight, but
napped it severely; Paddock fought on the
retreat and got down in the close, laughing.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock sent in a staggering hit on
Parsons’ left ear, but the Old’un stood it
bravely, and grasped his opponent, but he
could not hold him to fib, and Paddock
slipped through his hands cleverly.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;After a few seconds of sparring, Paddock
shot out his left, reaching Parsons’s
damaged ogle, and then got in one on the
mouth. Parsons rushed in for a close, but
again Paddock faced him and got down.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;The Old’un again led off, both hitting
away with mutual good will, a close, and
Paddock under.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Ding-dong work so soon as the men
were at the scratch, Parsons bleeding freely,
while Paddock as yet had scarcely a mark.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock dropped his left again on
Parsons’s mug, and his right on the body, and
fell. (Cries of “Stand up and fight like a
man, you have got it all your own way.”)</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock again shot out his left on
Parsons’s cheek, which was assuming a sorry
appearance. Parsons closed, in-fighting, and
Paddock down.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock again made his left and
right on Parsons’s dial, nevertheless, the Old’un
did not flinch, but fought his man to
the ropes, where Paddock fell.</p>

<p>12 to 17 were similar to the preceding,
in favour of Paddock; still Parsons was
game, and did all he could to turn the tide
in his favour, but it was useless, his day had
gone by.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;This was a slashing round, and the
best in the fight, Parsons making his right
tell on Paddock’s ribs, but caught it
awfully on his damaged mouth from Paddock’s
left. A close, good in-fighting, and
both fell together.</p>

<p>19 and      20.&mdash;&#8203;Parsons closed and bored his
man to the ropes, where Paddock fell.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Parsons at the scratch, game, but it
was no go. Paddock again shot out his left
on the dial, and made an upper cut with his
right. Parsons closed, a struggle for the
throw, and both fell, Paddock under.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Parsons first at the scratch, with his
left eye nearly closed and bleeding freely.
(Cries of “Take him away.”) Parsons
closed, both hitting away; at last Paddock
got down.</p>

<p>     23rd and last.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock went to his man,
hit out left and right, and caught Parsons a
tremendous smack over the left eye; it was
a stunner. A close followed, Paddock getting
his right arm round Parsons’s neck, hitting
up with severity; the punishment was
severe. Both men struggled, and fell together.
Parsons was taken to his corner in
an exhausted condition. His seconds, perceiving
it was useless to prolong the contest,
threw up the sponge, and Paddock was
hailed as the winner. The fight lasted
twenty-two minutes. Another instance of
the folly of backing an Ould’un against
Young’un.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;This was, certainly, a promising
<span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</span>; for though “Old Elijah” was
too stale to contend with such an impetuous,
hard-hitting, and resolute youngster as the
“Redditch needle-grinder,” he certainly
tested the Young’un’s game, who showed he
was “all there,” if he did not possess the
higher attainments of a scientific boxer.</p>

<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><span class="pageno">274</span>
<p>As a proof that the Brums at this time kept the game alive, we may
mention that another pair, Blackman and Chadwick, not choosing to lose
time, actually made an extempore ring, and got off a hard fight of forty-three
rounds in fifty-six minutes, in which Blackman was the victor, while
Shakespeare and Jenkins, and Paddock and Parsons were settling their
differences. Of course as, unlike Sir Boyle Roche’s bird, we could not be
in two places at once, we saw nothing of this; but we did see the fourth
fight, between Frazer Brown, of Walsall, who fought George Giles, a
West Bromwich youth, for a purse, which, after an hour’s hard work, to
the damage of both, but with no advantage to either, was divided, and so
ended a full day’s sport.</p>

<p>In the month of September, 1844, a fine, fresh young fellow, aged 22,
standing 6 feet, and weighing 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, came up to London, and displayed
such capabilities with the mittens that Johnny Broome at once
“spotted” him for a competitor for the yet-untried Bob Caunt, younger
brother to the Champion, Ben, who was just then being “trotted out” by
the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s Lane coterie. The new-comer, whose pals had denominated
him, on account of his smartness and good looks, “Nobby” Clarke,
was articled with “brother Bob” for £25 a side, and on the 22nd of October,
1844, he gave his opponent such a skilful thrashing in seven rounds, occupying
the brief space of a quarter of an hour, that his friends, too hastily judging
from this very short spin, announced the “Nobby One” as ready for
any 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> man for £50. Our hero, who was on the look-out for active
service, replied to the challenge, and on the 27th of January, 1846, they
met at Coleshill Castle, near West Bromwich; the battle exciting great
interest in Birmingham and the Midlands. “Nobby” Clarke was seconded
by the Tipton Slasher and Tass Parker; Tom Paddock by Hodgkiss and
Sam Hurst. Clarke was in splendid condition, and in looks fully justified
the 6 and 7 to 4 laid on him by the Brums. At a few minutes after eleven,
the men stood up and began</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Clarke, who was a model of
symmetry, had a noticeable superiority in
length and reach over the round and ruddy
Redditch man, who, however, not only
seemed undismayed, but lost no time in
sparring, and rattled in right and left. The
“Nobby One” stopped him neatly and retreated;
then let go his left at Paddock’s
head, but did not seem to leave a mark.
Paddock bored in, but Clarke caught him in
his arms, and both were down, Paddock
under.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Clarke sparred and broke ground; as
Paddock came on, hitting out viciously,
Clarke caught him an ugly crack on the
cheek-bone, and also one in the mouth.
(“First blood” for Clarke.) Paddock would
not be denied, and there were some ding-dong
exchanges, in which Paddock got in a
smasher on Clarke’s eyebrow, making a cut,
<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a><span class="pageno">275</span>
which balanced the account; in the embrace
which followed Paddock was undermost.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;A rattling rally, in which Paddock
showed most determination, the “Nobby
One” breaking away twice during the hitting;
but coming again to close quarters there were
some sharp deliveries on both sides, and
Paddock was first down.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock made play, but Clarke
avoided him, popping in one or two hits
cleverly. Paddock persevered, and after an
exchange or two, Clarke got the Redditch
man undermost.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Clarke nailed Paddock left and right,
but Tom bored in, caught Clarke a rib-roaster
with the right; the “Nobby One” at the
ropes made an attempt to butt, and then
got down. Cries of “Foul.” A number of
people forced themselves into the ring,
declaring a “foul.” The referee called on
the men to “go on.”</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;After some confusion the ring was
cleared. Clarke had still, in appearance, the
best of the hitting, Paddock’s cheek looking
like a scored beefsteak. A merry bout, but
Clarke would not get near enough; and, at
last, as he launched out his right and closed,
Paddock slipped down laughing. The ground
was a perfect quagmire, and foothold very
uncertain.</p>

<p>     7, 8, 9.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock first to fight in these
rounds. Clarke considerably shy in the
rallies, and getting down amidst some disapprobation.</p>

<p>     10, 11, 12.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock’s style a little improving.
He, however, did not shine at
out-fighting, “Nobby” getting on prettily
now and again, but never following up an
advantage. In the last-named round Paddock
was hit down in a scramble.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Clarke began with more confidence,
and nailed Paddock sharply twice in the
head. Tom got in on Clarke’s ribs, a sounding
thwack, and down went “Nobby,” to
finish the round. (Applause for Paddock.)</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Clarke shy and sparring, Paddock on
to him, when “Nobby” threw Tom a back-fall
in the close.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Exchanges; Paddock missed both
hands; Clarke caught him heavily in the
mouth, and Paddock was under in the
throw.</p>

<p>     16 to 21.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, game as a pebble,
went in, and though “Nobby” met him in
the head, he never failed to get home on the
body. Clarke clever at stopping and saving
his head, but shifty and shy. (5 and 6 to 4
on Paddock.)</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Clarke standing out and retreating
on the saving suit; Paddock, resolute and
determined, forcing the fighting. Clarke
but little marked, except the cut over the eye
in the second round though his left side
showed some red bumps from Paddock’s
right-hand body-blows, while Paddock was
bleeding from half a dozen cuts on the cheek,
nose, lips, and forehead. Still he was gay,
and driving “Nobby” into his own corner,
the latter dropped to avoid. (Hisses.)</p>

<p>     23 to 30.&mdash;&#8203;Similar in character, Clarke
going down almost every round.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Clarke, urged on by the Tipton, went
in to fight and got the best of several
exchanges, nearly closing his opponent’s left
eye. Paddock got in a hit on “Nobby’s”
neck, from which he turned round, and as
Paddock was repeating his blow fell.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;This ought to have been the last
round. Clarke caught Paddock on the forehead,
jumped back, ran away, and as Paddock
threw out his left fell without a blow.
(Great confusion, the ring broken in, and a
minute or two expired before the referee’s
decision could be obtained, who gave Clarke
the “benefit of the doubt,” from the slipperiness
of the ground.)</p>

<p>     33&ndash;40.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, despite the punishment
he appeared to have received, was little the
worse in wind or strength, while in pluck
he was the very reverse of his clever antagonist.
“Nobby” sparred cleverly, but was
evidently afraid of his man, and when they
got close and a half-arm hit was got in by
Paddock, he was always a consenting party
to going down; in fact, he was “on the go”
before the blow reached him.</p>

<p>     41.&mdash;&#8203;Another wrangle; “Nobby” getting
down questionably after getting in a left-hander.
(Hisses.)</p>

<p>     42.&mdash;&#8203;Great wrangling and confusion. Paddock
standing in the middle of the ring protesting,
and calling on “Nobby” to come
on, which he did after a minute or so of disputation.
Paddock went at him, and
“Nobby” slipped down. It was announced
that Clarke would “fight no more.” Paddock
again “orating;” the referee handed
over the watch to a friend, called “Time!”
and declared Paddock to be the winner.
The Tipton created some amusement by his
denunciations of the “Nobby One’s” cowardice,
and was with difficulty prevented
from striking the man he had just been
seconding; politely addressing him as a
“robber,” “cur,” “thief,” <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> with a variety
of expletives which we decline to report,
and ending by declaring he would
“pay no bets on such a rank cross.” He
had, however, to do so, as well as many
others, and the stakes went to Paddock, as
of right they were due.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;There was nothing so worthy
of note in this battle as the utter unreliability
of mere sparring skill when pitted against a
fair amount of boxing acquirements, backed
with those indispensable qualities, courage
and endurance. Clarke had weight, length,
skill, and, if properly applied, superior
strength on his side; nevertheless, the Redditch
man, by mere resolution and never losing
trust in himself, literally frightened his opponent
out of his victory. Paddock, though
inferior to the “Nobby One,” displayed great
improvement on his previous performance,
and we did not hesitate to predict for him
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span class="pageno">276</span>
a successful career, provided that he possessed
temper, discretion, and teachability,
which, for some time, he certainly did not.
Strength, pluck, stamina, and fearless courage
he had; the regulating and guiding

<p>Paddock having failed in meeting with a customer after his defeat of
Clarke, did not again appear within the ropes in 1846; but, on the 27th of
December in that year, the clever “Nobby One” having somewhat wiped
off the stain of cowardice which had attached to his name, by a triumphant
defeat of a 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> man of the name of Jordan, calling himself “the
Welsh Champion”&mdash;&#8203;his friends took “heart of grace,” and again
offered to back their man for £50 a side against our hero. The second
trial took place on the 6th of April, 1847, at Stony Stratford. We shall not
inflict upon the reader a full report of this battle. It was, with little variation
in its incidents, a mere replica of the first, except that it lasted seven
minutes less&mdash;&#8203;48 minutes&mdash;&#8203;and the close of the 35th round brought Tom’s
labours to a victorious conclusion. In the first few rounds Clarke, as on
the former occasion, took a triumphant lead; but his game and hardy
opponent stuck to him so determinedly, and, when he did get on, so completely&mdash;&#8203;as
his half-reconciled and again-deluded friend the Tipton said&mdash;&#8203;“Knocked
all the fight out of him,” that the result was merely a question
of minutes more or less; the fight being finally declared to Paddock from
a “foul” by the miscalled “Nobby One.”</p>

<p>In our Life of <span class="sc">Bendigo</span> (<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span> <a href="#Page_37">page 37</a>), we have fully narrated the circumstances
under which Paddock, as “Johnny Broome’s Unknown,” took
up the gauntlet thrown down by Bendigo for £200 and the Championship;
and how Paddock, after what appeared a winning fight, threw away
his advantages, and lost the battle by losing his temper&mdash;&#8203;striking his shifty
opponent a “foul” blow. This took place on the 5th of June, 1850, and
as the Tipton had already pledged himself to fight the winner (Bendigo
having announced his retirement from the Ring), the Slasher, then and
there, challenged him for £350, which was afterwards reduced to £200 a
side. This came to nothing, for on the 22nd of August, 1850, both parties
failed in their deposits, and the money down was drawn. A new
match was then entered into for £100 a side, and on this occasion, as the
battle ended in a draw, we shall merely refer the reader to the Life of
<span class="sc">Perry</span> (see <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span> <a href="#Page_157">page 157</a>), where, also, will be found the account of his
defeat by the Slasher, at Woking, December 17th, 1850, again from the
delivery of a “foul” blow.</p>

<p>These defeats, greatly due to obstinate violence and ungovernable temper,
seem to have induced some rash challenges to Paddock. In March, 1851,
<a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pageno">277</span>
Jack Grant was hastily matched with Paddock for £100, and £5 deposited;
but at the next meeting Grant’s backers took second thoughts, and Tom
pocketed the £5, as one of the “little fishes,” which are proverbially
“sweet.” In June, at an evening at Jem Burn’s, Con Parker (who
at that time kept the “Grapes,” in Aylesbury Street, Clerkenwell) proposed
a battle for £50 a side, to come off July 24th; but on the following
Wednesday Master Con’s courage, like Bob Acres’s, “oozed out at his
fingers’ ends,” and Paddock pocketed this affront also, and a “fiver.”</p>

<p>Harry Poulson, of Nottingham, a sturdy, game, and resolute man, a
trifle over 12st, was now thought good enough to dispute superiority with
Paddock, and on the 23rd of September, 1851, the men met at Sedgebrook,
near Grantham, for the small stake of £25 a side. This battle,
which was lost by Paddock, after a desperate fight of 71 rounds, occupying
95 minutes, will be found under Poulson, in the <span class="sc">Appendix</span> to
Period <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr></p>

<p>Paddock, who was under a passing cloud, seemed now to be shut out
from the front rank, Harry Broome having attained the honours of the
belt by beating the Slasher, on the 29th September, 1851. (See Life of
<span class="sc">Broome</span>, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">post.</span>) He was, in fact, at this time under articles with his former
antagonist, Poulson, for a second trial, and the day fixed for December
16th, 1851. This proved an unfortunate affair for both parties. They
met at Cross End, near Belper, Derbyshire, and the deposits being entirely
carried out in Nottingham, no reporter from the London Press was on the
ground, nor were any of the known patrons of the Ring present. The
battle was gallantly contested, and Paddock, avoiding a fault conspicuous
on a former occasion, had been most assiduous in his training. As usual,
in gatherings where the roughs are predominant as partisans, there was a
tedious waste of time in the appointment of a referee: any person of
respectability who might have been present being either objected to, or
himself objecting to take the thankless and often perilous office. The
fight began at a little before one, Paddock gaining “first blood” and
“first knock down,” by a delivery on Poulson’s left eye. After the first
six rounds, Paddock forced the fighting, and had it nearly all his own way,
Poulson’s want of condition telling against him. Eighty-six rounds were
fought in 95 minutes, when Paddock was declared the winner amidst
the plaudits of his friends.</p>

<p>Poulson was severely punished about the body. Paddock by no means
escaped unscathed. Had the fight been conducted in a quiet manner, it
<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a><span class="pageno">278</span>
would have been an affair which would not have discredited the older days
of the Ring; but we regret to say the worst part of our tale remains to be
told. The magistrates of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and Leicestershire,
aware that the fight was likely to come off in one of those counties, had
for some days previously been on the look-out to ascertain the place of
meeting, but had been put on the wrong scent; consequently, at the commencement
of the battle, no efficient force was in attendance to prevent it.
After the fight had continued some time, however, Messrs. John and
Jedediah Strutt, with Captain Hopkins and another Derbyshire magistrate,
arrived, and proceeded to dissolve the assemblage, with no other
assistance than that of William Wragg, chief constable of Belper, to
enforce their commands. The mob, however, refused to allow interference,
when Mr. Jedediah Strutt rode up to the crowd, and ordered them to disperse.
Paddock seem inclined to give over, but was told that if he did
he would lose the money. The men, therefore, continued fighting, whereupon
Mr. Jedediah Strutt attempted to force his way into the ring, for the
purpose of reading the Riot Act, and Wragg, single-handed, endeavoured
to clear a passage for him. A cry was raised of “Keep them out,” and
about fifty roughs pounced upon the superintendent, and beat him savagely
with sticks. The injured man was conveyed to Belper, where Mr. Allen and
Mr. Lomas, surgeons, by skilful attendance, restored him to consciousness.
The fight being concluded, the men set off for Derby, to which place Captain
Hopkins had galloped off for assistance, and having obtained the
co-operation of the borough-force, he met the combatants as they entered
Derby, in different conveyances, with the intention of proceeding by train
to Nottingham. Paddock and his second were taken out of a cab, and
Poulson was apprehended amidst his friends in a “drag.” When taken,
one of Paddock’s first observations was that “If he had won the toss for
the choice of place, he would have chosen any place rather than that confounded
county;” that he was sorry “the p’liceman was hurt; and
he would have given over when the magistrates ordered them to disperse,
but he was told that if he did he would lose the money; and, as he had
been served so once before, he determined to go on with the fight.”</p>

<p>In this disgraceful riot and violence, we are happy to say, the men and
their immediate seconds and backers took no part, as the subjoined letter
from an eye-witness fully shows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pneg flushright">“Derby, December 24th, 1851.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Mr. Editor.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Believing that a few words on the outrages committed at Paddock and
<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pageno">279</span>
Poulson’s fight may not be out of place, I send you the following: At the close of your
Pedestrian Intelligence last week you gave some excellent advice to all connected with
manly sports, and expressed a hope that those who by their ruffianly conduct thus disgrace the
Ring, may receive their full deserts at the hands of the law. Were I the judge to try them,
I would transport the whole; indeed, their conduct furnishes the opponents of prize-fighting
with weightier arguments than could be found elsewhere. If pugilism, they may say, encourages
fair play, and insists on equal strife, how comes it that one man shall be set upon
by fifty of its supporters, and ill treated until it is doubtful whether he be dead or alive?
But now let me say a word upon the state of the law in general, and the conduct of its
instruments in this particular case. The same journal that reports the disturbance at the
fight, details also the particulars of a murderous affray among the ‘navvies’ of the South
Wales line; and, did we but alter the names of the places and persons, the whole of the latter
skirmish might very well pass for a massacre among Malays or cannibals; stabbing, burning,
maiming, and bruising&mdash;&#8203;a dozen nearly dead, perhaps quite so, by this time. Yet I will
venture to predict that the perpetrator of these villanies will reap no heavier punishment
than would a poor fellow, professed boxer or not, who may have chanced in fair and
honourable fight&mdash;&#8203;such a thing occurring, perhaps, once out of a couple of thousand times&mdash;&#8203;to
have caused the death of his antagonist. Such being the case&mdash;&#8203;the law looking with
equal eyes at a butchery that would disgrace the Caffres, and a combat conducted with all
possible fairness&mdash;&#8203;men have no reason to choose the latter mode of settling their quarrels,
but may as well, they think, adopt the method which inflicts the greatest injury on their
enemies. Where men get two or three months for ‘knifing’ an opponent, and others get imprisoned
for a twelvemonth for seconding or being present at a prize fight&mdash;&#8203;although no harm
may be done beyond the breach of our Sovereign Lady’s peace&mdash;&#8203;it does not require a prophet or
a Solomon to tell us to what state of things such a course must lead among the lower orders
of people. And now I must ask, in the name of common sense, what the magistrates who
interfered at Paddock’s fight expected? I would as lieve venture among a pack of wolves,
as go single-handed to thwart a mob of midland counties roughs. Had the officer died, his
death would have been owing to sheer foolhardiness, or the obstinacy of those who urged
him on. I have seen hundreds of men, more than once, quietly disperse at the order of a
magistrate, though he was quite alone, unsupported by even a single officer. So it ought
to be, so I hope it will be, and so it must be, if pugilists hope that the next generation may
know anything of their doings, except by tradition. Allow me to add that none but the
‘roughs’ took part in the brutal assault on the constable, Wragg.&emsp;Yours, &amp;c.,</p>

</div><!--end letter-->

<p>The upshot of this regretable riot was that Paddock and Poulson, being
by law responsible as “principals,” were sentenced each, in March, 1852,
to ten months’ imprisonment with hard labour.</p>

<p>Paddock’s forced seclusion in Derby Gaol, although it appears to have
had a favourable effect on his violence of temper, did not diminish his readiness
to play the “rubber game” with Poulson; inasmuch as we find him
articled to meet his old antagonist on the 14th of February, 1854, to try a
final appeal, with £200 deposited to abide the issue.</p>

<p>Paddock at once went into assiduous training in company with Tom
Sayers, at Mr. Patton’s, mine host of the “Old Hat,” Ealing; and Poulson
did the same at the Neptune Inn, Hove, near Brighton, under the
guidance of Jerry Noon; it being thought advisable to fix his training
quarters far from the too friendly visits of his Nottingham admirers.
Poulson was, on this occasion, backed from Caunt’s, Paddock from Alec
Keene’s. As this battle was arranged for the London district, a trip per
Eastern Counties rail was agreed on. By the time named, half-past eight, the
crowd in the neighbourhood of the Shoreditch station gave evidence that
something unusual was on the <em>tapis</em>, hundreds of East-Enders surrounding
<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><span class="pageno">280</span>
the terminus to catch a glimpse of the heroes of the day. The first to
show was Harry Poulson, who entered the station accompanied by Jerry
Noon, Callaghan, of Derby, and a dozen of Nottingham friends; he looked
hard as nails, bright-eyed, smiling, and confident, and in rare preservation
for an old’un, 37 summers having shone on his nob. He was soon followed
by the Redditch champion, attended by Tom Sayers, Alec Keene, and Mr.
Hibburd (one of his principal backers). Both men now began to distribute
their colours to the voyagers on the platform, and, from the numerous handkerchiefs
of both designs which were seen knotted round the throttles of
the ticket-holders, the sale must have been satisfactory. At a quarter before
nine the bell rang for the start, and although the town air was foggy, no
sooner were we well on our way than the sun of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Valentine shone out
brilliantly, the hoar-frost deposited overnight vanished, and the pairing
birds chirruped their courting notes from every hedge and thicket. The
commissariat, under the care of Dan Pinkstone, occupying a saloon carriage,
was first-class, as in an after-part of the day we had occasion to
prove. The train sped merrily; and at a quarter-past eleven o’clock all disembarked,
in high spirits, at the appointed station, Mildenhall, where the
veteran Commissary and Tom Callas formed the lists in double-quick time,
and the men soon after made their appearance. Poulson was attended by
Jemmy Welsh and Jerry Noon, and Paddock esquired by Jemmy Massey
and Jack Macdonald, to our thinking the best of all seconds of the present
day. On shaking hands Paddock offered to back himself for “an even
tenner,” which Poulson accepted; but the backers of Paddock in this “the
rubber game” stood out for odds, and so little business was done. At
length, umpires and a referee being chosen, at half-past twelve the rival
pugs, stood up for</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On the men throwing themselves
into attitude their appearance was
carefully scanned; the enormous development
of muscle on Poulson’s arms and his
blade-bones excited astonishment among the
Londoners, who now saw him stripped for
the first time. Still they were confident in
the man of their adoption, for Paddock was
indeed in robust health, and appeared to
have so much the superiority in length and
height that they now laid evens on him.
No time was lost in sparring or in striking
attitudes; Poulson at once dashed in, made
his right on Tom’s ribs, and directly after on
his mouth. Paddock was with him, and a
shower of half-arm hits followed, each getting
pepper on the left side of the nut until
both were down.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson went to work without delay,
and began by pounding away with his right;
Tom did not flinch, though he got it on the
nose heavily, and then on his potato trap,
from which the first vintage of the season
was instantly perceived. (First blood for
Poulson, amid cheers from the Nottingham
lads.) Paddock slipped down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, first to the scratch, led off
with his left and gave Harry a tremendous
crack on the forehead, Poulson returning
almost a counter-hit on Tom’s left cheek.
This led to a slogging rally, in which Poulson
again visited Paddock’s cheek, while the
<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><span class="pageno">281</span>
latter tapped the claret from Harry’s left
eyebrow, and Poulson fell.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock again led off, and just reached
Poulson’s right eye, Poulson was with him,
and some sharp counters took place, Paddock
catching it on the nozzle from Poulson’s
left, while Tom retorted with a swinging
crack on Poulson’s left ear. They now
broke away, but soon returned to work;
Paddock let fly right and left viciously at
Harry’s frontispiece, when Poulson countered
him steadily on the snout and forehead.
Poulson was first on the ground.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock again opened the ball with a
sharp rap on Harry’s cheek, but the latter
retorted with such a sounding rib-bender
that it was heard all round the ring. Soon
after Tom landed a little one on Poulson’s
right brow, cutting it, and producing the
crimson. Both now banged away at close
quarters, and in the end both came down.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Both sparred for wind; indeed, the
fighting had been very fast; some random
shots were exchanged, the men closed, and
rolled down together.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock let go his left, but it went
clean over Poulson’s cranium. A second
shot reached his forehead, but for this Tom
caught a smasher on the mouth, that drew
the Oporto copiously, and seemed for a
second or two to puzzle Tom seriously.
However, he went in, and more yard-arm
to yard-arm cannonading followed; no
quarter was given or asked for, but at the
end of the ding-dong Paddock was down
with the worst of the hitting.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock came up crimson as the
“Red Lion,” at Brentford, but he led off
without delay, and they were soon at infighting;
Paddock got on his knees in the
scrimmage, and Poulson dealt him a “hot
one” on his snuff-box. A claim of “foul”
from Paddock’s friends, but disallowed.
Poulson’s blow could not be withheld, as it
was delivered simultaneously with Paddock’s
knees reaching the ground.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, twice foiled in leading off,
went in furiously, reaching Harry’s nose,
and removing the bark, but getting a Roland
for his Oliver in a smasher on his own olfactory
organ that sadly spoilt its symmetry.
Hitting right and left, and no stopping on
either side, until Paddock went down in
the exchanges.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Both were distilling the crimson from
their left eyes; Paddock led off with the
left, and got again heavily countered in the
face. Poulson slipped and dropped on one
knee; Paddock might have hit him, but he
withheld his hand, and walked to his corner
amidst applause.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson dashed in, delivering his
right heavily on the side of Tom’s nut, but
the blow seemed open-handed. A merry
rally ensued, in which some sharp, half-arm
hits were exchanged, Paddock receiving
some sharp thumps in the ribs, and
retaliating on Poulson’s knowledge-box.
Both down in the close.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock feinted, and then let go his
left, a cross hit on Poulson’s cheek; he got
away, and repeated the dose on Harry’s
smeller. Poulson seemed stung at these
visitations, rushed in, and after some busy
half-arm work Paddock was down.</p>

<p>     13 to 20.&mdash;&#8203;Busy rounds, but short, and
very similar in character, Paddock opening
the ball and getting on by his superior
length, but Poulson winding up the rounds
by fear-nought hitting, and Paddock ending
them by being first to grass.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock still first, got in his left on
Poulson’s bread basket, and his right on the
side of the head; the latter was retaliated
by a severe body-blow, and Paddock broke
away. Paddock nailed Poulson on the nose,
and on the left brow, still Poulson pegged
away, but was first down from a wild hit of
Tom’s on the side of his head.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson tried to open the ball, but his
left was stopped, and then his right, and Tom
got home an ugly one on Harry’s left eye,
which showed symptoms of the early closing
movement. Poulson went in, but Tom
planted an upper-cut on the damaged ogle,
and Poulson slipped down.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, on time being called, rose
and walked rapidly across towards Poulson’s
corner. The latter had hardly time to turn
round from his seconds, when Tom let fly
at his forehead. Poulson let go both hands
without aim; Tom missed a vicious hit
with his left, and Poulson slipped down in
a scramble.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson was quickly up at the call
of time, determined not to be stolen a march
on; he opened the pleadings by a declaration
with the right on Tom’s ribs, but got
it on the mouth, and in a second attempt
was stopped neatly; he, however, persevered,
and some ding-dong exchanges ended by
Poulson slipping down.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Both men slower, as well they might
be, Paddock giving his adversary a crack on
the bridge of the nose that compelled him
to snuffle and wink; half-arm hitting, in
which Paddock dropped.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson took the initiative; he
stepped in, caught Paddock a heavy spank
with the right on the left cheek, and slipped
from the force of his own blow.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson again rattled in; Tom countered,
and Poulson was down in the hitting.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Both seemed of opinion that a turn
of the tide must be at hand. No time was
lost on either side; Paddock made play,
but Poulson was with him, and at close
quarters they pegged away, Paddock with his
straight left and Poulson with his dangerous
right; but Jack was as good as his master&mdash;&#8203;or
rather Harry was as good as Tom. Though
Poulson was first on the ground he had not
the worst of the hitting.</p>

<p>     29 to 34.&mdash;&#8203;Alternate leading off, but Paddock
best at the attack. Poulson’s eyes
were much damaged, though he was still
the stronger man on his legs. The left side
of Paddock’s face was awfully swelled, and
<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pageno">282</span>
as Jerry Noon said, “Was polished like a
newly lasted boot.” At the end of round
33, Poulson fairly sent down Paddock in a
close rally, and the seconds of the latter
cautioned him to “keep away” from infighting.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock adopted the advice. He
measured his distance with his left got it
in, but not heavily, on Poulson’s forehead,
and jumped back; Poulson followed,
but Tom retreated and shifted, hitting out
as opportunity offered. Paddock got home
on Harry’s right peeper, but could not prevent
a visit to his ribs, and a sharp crack
on the nose, from which the ruby distilled
copiously. Poulson closed, and Paddock got
down.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock’s mug, on coming up, was
a curious mixture of the comic and the
serious. The right side, which was untouched,
bore a sort of grin, while the left
side, which was swollen to twice its natural
size, buried the other half of the laugh in
its tumefied recesses. He had, too, a cut on
the bridge of his nose, and a blue mouse
under his left eye. Poulson’s hardier mug
was less battered in appearance, but his
left eye was nearly closed, and the remaining
window damaged. Paddock got on to
Poulson slightly, and after some exchanges,
both were down.</p>

<p>     37 to 50.&mdash;&#8203;As before; alternate leads,
followed by half-arm hitting, and one or
the other down. Anybody’s battle.</p>

<p>     51.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson’s left eye was now entirely
in darkness, but he dashed in. Paddock
caught him round the neck with his left
arm, but could not screw him up for fibbing.
Poulson kept pegging away, although getting
the worst of it, and got down through
Paddock’s hands.</p>

<p>     52.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock let go his left on Poulson’s
nose, but Poulson rushed in and pelted away
till Tom got down to finish the round.</p>

<p>     53.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock kept working in, and twice
reached Harry’s eye and brow without a
return. As they got closer there were some
sharp exchanges, Poulson getting home a
heavy hit on Paddock’s left eye, and also on
his bruised ribs; Poulson was, however,
down.</p>

<p>     54.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock several times attempted to
get in his favourite blow on the mark, but
he was not quite near enough; at last he got
home effectively, and Poulson reeled from
the blow; Paddock followed him up, caught
him on the head with the right, and Poulson
was down.</p>

<p>     55 to 60.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson’s right eye seemed to
be in danger of following suit with the left.
He evidently thought there was no time to
be lost, and as Paddock would not come to
close quarters, he rattled in somewhat wild
and round, and in the 59th and 60th rounds
was down.</p>

<p>     61.&mdash;&#8203;Both came tired and slow, with but
little to choose as to which was the weaker
man. Paddock caught Poulson in the neck,
changing his aim to the body, then caught
Poulson on the proboscis, who closed and
fell.</p>

<p>     62 to 65.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock commenced business
in each of these rounds; in the last-named
Paddock delivered a spank with the left
under Poulson’s right eye which knocked
the brave fellow off his legs, and was pronounced
to be “First knock-down to Paddock.”
There was loud cheering, and many
thought the fight over, concluding that
Poulson’s right eye must now be closed. To
the surprise of all, however, Harry came up
at the call of “Time,” looking little, if any,
the worse for the knock-down.</p>

<p>     66, 67.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson steadily stopped two
attempts with the left. Paddock at length got
in a blow on the mark, and Poulson missed
his return. Paddock hit over Poulson’s
head with the left, and Poulson closed and
fell.</p>

<p>     68.&mdash;&#8203;Both slow; after some ineffective exchanges
Paddock concentrated his energies,
and, letting go his left straight from the
shoulder, gave poor Poulson a nose-ender
that again knocked him off his legs.</p>

<p>     69 to 75.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson, losing precision in
his deliveries from his failing eyesight, was
nobbed almost at pleasure by his opponent,
yet he never failed to get in a hard blow
when they were at close quarters.</p>

<p>     76 to 88.&mdash;&#8203;In all these rounds Poulson came
up with unshrinking courage and determination,
and his friends clung to the idea that
a chance blow might yet reward his exertions,
while Paddock’s friends, though they
thought themselves on the winning side,
feared that he could not finish his day’s
work satisfactorily, and that a “draw”
might yet disappoint their hopes. Round
after round Poulson came up, amid cries of
“Take him away!” But the brave fellow
refused to give in.</p>

<p>     89.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson, to the astonishment of all,
was no sooner at the scratch, than he rushed
at his opponent with such vigour and determination,
pegging away right and left,
that Paddock, in retreating, fell on his
south pole in a ludicrous state of surprise
and bewilderment at this unexpected but
ineffective onslaught.</p>

<p>     90.&mdash;&#8203;It was clear that this was the last
flickering effort. Poulson came up weak
and shaky, and, on Paddock letting go his
left, fell.</p>

<p>     91 to 102 and last.&mdash;&#8203;It was clearly all over
with the gallant Harry. Paddock, by the
advice of his seconds, kept away from his
man, and just popped in a hit when he saw
an opening, whereon Poulson fell. Noon
vainly urged him to give in, until, in the
102nd round, his seconds and several of his
backers, seeing the hopelessness as well as
danger of prolonging the contest, threw up
the sponge, and Paddock was declared the
winner, after a desperate battle of <em>two hours
and thirty-two minutes</em>.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Few remarks will suffice upon
this game and manly encounter. Experienced
<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><span class="pageno">283</span>
ring-goers tell us that second fights,
still more third battles, between the same
men are, as a rule, unsatisfactory. This was
indeed an exception to that rule. It was, in
courage, active work, and endurance, the
best fight between big ones for many a day
past. Poulson, for a man pronounced “stale”
by many, is an extraordinary quick and
punishing hitter, but he depends too much
on his right, and thus throws open his face
to the blows of a superior tactician. With
any man not more skilful than himself he
must yet prove the victor, but not even his
game and gluttony can enable him to conquer
a clever two-handed boxer possessed of
resolution and skill like Tom Paddock. We
must give praise to Jerry Noon for his
humanity in throwing up the sponge when
he did, and this we the more insist on as we
know that he has been most shamefully censured
and even abused, since the affair, by
persons who ought to know better, and who
have even brought to us their complaints of
what they call his “unauthorised giving in
against the wish of Poulson himself.” No
impartial spectator can support such an argument
for a moment, and the stakes were
accordingly given up, with the approbation
of the referee, despite a notice served upon
the stakeholder.</p>

<p>Paddock, having thus retrieved his first defeat by the hardy Harry
Poulson, by a second victory, was soon after called to the field by his old
opponent Aaron Jones, who now sent forth his cartel from the domicile of
Jem Burn, who had moved his head-quarters westward from Windmill
Street to the erewhile domus of Johnny Broome, the “Rising Sun,” in
Air Street, Piccadilly. Paddock, as before, was backed from Alec
Keene’s, the “Three Tuns,” in Moor Street. The stakes, £100 a side,
were duly made good, and the 18th of July, 1854, saw both parties embarked
on board “The Waterman, No. 7,” which was the craft chartered
to convey the men and the managers to the battle-field. On this
occasion Paddock trained at Brighton, under the supervision of Alec
Keene; Aaron first at Newbridge, in Ireland, near the Curragh, and
later on at Shrewsbury, under the auspices of some distinguished military
officers, and the mentorship of Jerry Noon. “The loquacious” Jerry won the
toss for choice of corners, and took the corner with Jones’s back to the sun.
Paddock, after an ineffectual attempt to lay an even “tenner” with his
adversary, offered Jones 2 to 1, but there being no response, Tom, much
disappointed, replaced the flimsy in his pocket. All being in readiness, and
rumours of Jones’s inferior condition spread about the ring, offers to lay
2 to 1 on Paddock were taken to some amount. The colours were tied
to the stakes, the men shook hands, and at ten minutes to one began</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On assuming the perpendicular
it was evident that Jones was the taller and
more symmetrical man. He was, despite
rumour, in excellent condition. There was
a pleasing smile of confidence and an ease in
his attitude that favourably impressed the
spectators; in short, he looked a model of a
12 stone man. Tom, the rough-and-ready,
seemed rather lighter than usual&mdash;&#8203;he was declared
to be no more than 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 9<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>&mdash;&#8203;but
he still looked rounder, stronger, and tougher
than his fairer skinned opponent. Paddock
lost no time in sparring but went straight in,
catching Jones on the forehead, but getting
a smack in return on the proboscis from
Jones, who said, smilingly, “You had it
there!” Paddock replied by making another
dash, and landing on Aaron’s cheek, who retorted
on the side of Tom’s head. Some
rather wild exchanges followed, left and
<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a><span class="pageno">284</span>
right, in which each displayed more haste
than judgment; they then broke away. Paddock
twice made his left on Jones’s cheek,
leaving marks of his handiwork; on trying a
third time, Jones countered him sharply on
the nose, then closed, and both rolled over,
Paddock undermost.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock let go his left and reached
Jones’s ear, another attempt was too high, and
a third was cleverly stopped. Paddock bored
in, when Jones met him with a sounding
spank on the left eye that made Tom “see
fireworks.” Paddock forced the fighting,
but after a rally, in which no harm was done,
Jones gripped Paddock and threw him in
good style, falling on him. (Applause from
the “Rising Sun.”)</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Jones came up all smiles, but Paddock
did not give him a chance of leading off, for
he rattled in left and right, but was cleverly
stopped. Tom afterwards succeeded in landing
on Aaron’s ribs, but sent his left over
Jones’s shoulder. He then bored in, but
Jones jumped back quickly, caught Paddock
in his arms, and again threw him neatly,
Jones being evidently the better wrestler.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock made his left hand and then
his right, the latter heavily, on Aaron’s
left optic. A ding-dong rally ensued, in
which Jones drew “first blood” from Tom’s
smelling organ. The men closed, and some
severe fighting took place at close quarters,
Jones getting it on the forehead and ear,
Paddock on the ribs. Both down.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Jones’s left peeper in mourning from
Paddock’s one, two, in the previous round.
Paddock grinned derisively, and at once
went to work, but was stopped cleverly.
Jones returned with both hands, dropping
on to Tom’s nose and left cheek. Paddock
looked vexed, and went in with both hands,
when Jones was down first.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock led off, but Jones countered
him heavily on the nose. Paddock reciprocated
with a heavy left-hander, also on the
nasal prominence, and after some exchanges
both were down.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock led off short, and Jones
missed his left, but soon afterwards got on
his right on the side of Tom’s head, inflicting
a deep cut that bled freely. Jones closed,
and after a brief struggle threw Paddock a
burster.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Jones led off, nailed Tom sharply on
the left eyebrow with the right, closed at
the ropes, and hung on Paddock till he got
down.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock looked unutterable things at
finding Jones was not the easy customer he
had expected. He rushed in, hit-or-miss,
banged in his left at Aaron’s head, who retaliated
straight and swift on the cheek and
side of the brain-pan; this led to a rally in
favour of Jones, who threw Paddock, and
walked to his corner laughing.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock began hastily, but was
stopped. Jones closed and again threw him,
falling on him.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock let fly his left, but was short.
Jones kept him at arm’s length. Paddock
got closer, but his hits were stopped. Jones
then got home on Tom’s left eye, making a
cut and drawing the crimson fluid. Some
tremendous exchanges followed, Jones sticking
to his work in a style that electrified
those who doubted his pluck, and in the end
Jones gained the second event by knocking
Paddock off his legs by a right-hander which
cut open his left eyebrow. (“First knock-down”
for Jones.) The layers of 3 to 1, for
some had ventured those odds, looked blue,
and there was some anxiety to “hedge;”
even money would have been taken, but
there were no layers.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Jones’s left optic all but closed. He
went in wildly, and Paddock slipped down.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Jones let go his left, which went over
Tom’s shoulder; with his right he was more
successful, and reached Tom’s left eye a sharp
crack. Paddock was out of distance with
his return, and Jones again slipped down.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock led off, but was prettily
stopped, left and right. Jones returned on
the left temple, closed, and again threw Paddock
heavily, falling on him.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;On getting together, good exchanges
took place, Paddock reaching Aaron’s snuffbox
smartly, but Jones giving him a rattler
on the domino-box in return. Jones, in the
rally which followed, struck Paddock on the
top of the head, to the damage of his own
dexter fin, and then slipped down.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Jones dashed in fearlessly, got home
a heavy one on Tom’s left ear, who went
down on his right hand with a sort of half-consenting
stagger, and so finished the
round.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Jones, still forcing the fighting,
dashed out left and right, and Tom, in
stopping and getting away, fell by catching
his heel against the centre stake.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock now tried for a lead; he
opened the ball by dropping his left on
Aaron’s cheek-bone, and got it on the side
of the head&mdash;&#8203;tit-for-tat. Some tremendous
exchanges followed, when Jones closed, shot
his left arm round Paddock’s neck, threw
him a clean back-fall, and fell on him.
(We learned, subsequently, that in this
round Jones so severely injured his left
shoulder that he was incapacitated from its
free use for several succeeding rounds; he
also complained that Jerry Noon, by his
careless way of lifting him, increased the
mischief by an additional twist.)</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Jones went in and pegged away, but
his left-hand hits seemed ineffective; Tom
hit out wildly, but at last fell with his own
consent.</p>

<p>     20&ndash;24.&mdash;&#8203;Jones planted on Paddock’s frontispiece
cleverly; but there was no steam in
the hits. In the last-named round Paddock
slipped down, but instantly jumped up to
renew the round; Jones, who was in the
arms of his seconds, released himself, and
at it they went. After some wild exchanges,
<a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span class="pageno">285</span>
the men embraced, swung round, and both
fell.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock got home his left bunch of
fives on Aaron’s sadly damaged optic. Jones
returned on the side of the head, and in
going down narrowly escaped a swinging
blow from Paddock’s right.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Jones dashed in on the snout, whence
spouted a crimson jet, then closed, and,
after a short struggle, both fell, Paddock
under.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Jones again rattled in, but his left-hand
blows seemed mere pushes, his following
hits with the right being sharp and
heavy. After mutual exchanges, Jones
again gripped Paddock and threw him, falling
over him. As they lay on the ground
Paddock patted Jones on the shoulder, in a
patronising way, as if saying, “Well done,
my lad!”</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Jones broke ground by letting go
both hands, but they were mere fly-flaps.
In trying to get nearer he missed his left,
over-reached himself, and fell.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, tired of the defensive,
dashed in; they quickly got to work, and
after a merry rally, in which there were
several mutual misses, both were down,
Paddock undermost.</p>

<p>     30&ndash;34.&mdash;&#8203;Good sharp rounds, with equal
success; Paddock getting twice or three
times on to Jones’s good eye&mdash;&#8203;the right&mdash;&#8203;which
looked in danger of following suit
like its sinister brother. In the last round
Paddock again thrown.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, anxious for a turn, went in
resolutely; Jones met him with the right,
and propped him severely, his left, though
he made use of it in stopping, doing no
damage to his opponent. In the exchanges
Paddock slipped down.</p>

<p>     36&ndash;46.&mdash;&#8203;Similar in character, sharp rallies,
some wild but punishing exchanges;
Jones the best of the closes, but Paddock
hitting hardest.</p>

<p>     47.&mdash;&#8203;Jones went in and forced his man
determinedly; he got his right hand heavily
on Tom’s listener, but received a slashing
upper-cut while attempting to close, he
staggered and fell, his knees evidently failing
him.</p>

<p>     48.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock grinned at his opponent,
and looked round at his friends, nodding his
head as he put up his hands at the scratch.
He popped in his left on the side of Aaron’s
head, who fell, Paddock just missing a right-hander
as Jones went to earth.</p>

<p>     49&ndash;52.&mdash;&#8203;Jones’s fighting ineffective, and
Paddock slowly improving his position.</p>

<p>     53.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock again visited the old spot
on Jones’s left cheek, and Jones was again
down. It was evident the steam was out of
Jones’s deliveries, though he yet preserved
his form of stopping and hitting. In fact,
his left was no longer his best weapon.
From this to the 70th round comparatively
little mischief was done, through exhaustion
from continued exertion, falls, and repeated
blows. Paddock, whose hands were swollen
by repeated visitations to Jones’s forehead
and brain-pan, did but little execution,
while Jones, with his sprained left shoulder
and weakened understandings, was too tottery
to go in with effect. In the 78th round
Paddock sent a smasher into Jones’s remaining
window, the shutter of which was
fast closing. Cries of “Take him away!”
to which Jones contemptuously replied,
“I’m good for another hour!”</p>

<p>     79.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock went in as if to finish, but
Jones astonished him by stopping his left,
and retaliating with such a stinger on the side
of the nut, that he rolled down and over,
amidst the shouts of the spectators.</p>

<p>     80.&mdash;&#8203;Jones was evidently fighting against
fate. Paddock, though his hands were
puffed, seemed little the worse for wear in
wind or strength, while Jones was weak on
his pins, pumped out, had but one good
arm, and was gradually losing distinct
vision. Forty-one more rounds were fought,
making 121; but though Jones made many
gallant efforts to turn the tide, fate was
against him. His backers (the principal one
was absent) were willing he should give in,
but the game fellow would not hear of it.
He gradually became blind, and, at length,
in the 121st round, he rushed wildly in the
direction of Paddock, who steadily propped
him on the side of the jaw with the left,
then delivering his right on the body, down
went poor Aaron in a heap, nature forsook
him, and Paddock stood over him the victor,
after a determined struggle of <em>two hours and
twenty-four minutes</em>.</p>

<p>     Both men were immediately conveyed on
board “Waterman No. 7,” where they received
every attention. Paddock quickly
recovered, though his external marks of
punishment were numerous and severe;
Jones, however, was not himself for a considerable
period. The boat at once returned
to town; but as she departed before the
second fight (between Spooner and Donovan)
was concluded, ourselves and many
others were compelled to avail ourselves
of the Gravesend Railway, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">via</span> Dartford or
Purfleet, which brought all in good time to
their homes in the great Metropolis.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;The reader of the foregoing
account will cordially agree with us that
Jones in this gallant battle completely
wiped out any stain of cowardice which the
result of his battle with Orme might have
attached to his character. His own statement
to us, that he did not refuse to meet
Orme a third time from any dread of punishment,
but simply upon the advice of his
backers and friends, was fully borne out.
His perseverance, after the disablement of
his left shoulder in the 18th round, and the
unflinching endurance with which he faced
so determined a two-handed hitter as Paddock,
for ever dispose of the imputation of
a white feather in Aaron’s composition. The
loser certainly left no stone unturned, no
<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><span class="pageno">286</span>
resource untried, to achieve victory, and if
he failed to command success he did more&mdash;&#8203;he
deserved it. Paddock, as usual in his
later fights, fought with coolness and good-humour,
taking the roughest blows and falls
without a murmur. His left cheek, eye,
temple, and ear were fearfully swollen,
while the right side presented a curious
contrast by retaining its original shape and
expression. His hands were more injured
than in any of his previous battles, and this
will account for the protracted nature of
the contest after the tide had turned against
Jones. The fairness of Paddock’s fighting,
even, on several occasions, to the extent of
forbearance, was the admiration of all who
witnessed the contest. Paddock, too, was
certainly weak towards the close, owing to
the burning sun under which the battle
was fought. For ourselves, the mere work
of sitting in a somewhat constrained position,
in the full blaze of its rays, attending
to our duties as referee, occasionally holding
a bet, and taking the note which form the
“bones” of the foregoing account, so entirely
beat us that we can speak feelingly of the
labours of the men who were subjected to and
went through such a trying ordeal. Their
endurance speaks volumes for the wonderful
results attainable by training and condition.
In brief, we may say in conclusion, that a
better or more courageous fight has not been
seen since Paddock last met the game and
persevering Poulson.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>The battle-money (£200) was handed to Paddock on the ensuing Monday,
at Alec Keene’s, “Three Tuns,” Moor Street, Soho, when a handsome
collection was made as a golden salve for the wounds of the brave but
unfortunate Aaron Jones.</p>

<p>That Aaron Jones fully removed by his last two battles every trace
of suspicion as to want of game is certain, but that he will ever be able to
take a first-rate position as a pugilist is extremely dubious; not from want
of either courage or capabilities as a punisher, but from the simple fact that
his constitution is not sufficiently strong to enable him to stand for any
great length of time the fatigues of a contest with a determined lasting
adversary like Paddock. He is a civil, well-conducted young fellow, and
a great favourite among those who know him well. His defeat has not lost
him a single friend, though it has gained him many. It is just possible
that his constitutional defects may be removed as he grows older, and if
they are, he will prove an awkward customer to any one who may fancy
him; but unless he can improve his stamina, and that very materially, we
would advise him to abstain in future from milling pursuits. Paddock
fought steadier and with more generalship than we had given him credit
for, and, to our surprise, his hands, which in all former battles had swelled
so as almost to incapacitate him from inflicting punishment, stood firm and
hard to the last. His hits were delivered with much judgment, and,
although he was fearfully punished, he never flinched from his task. He
says it was a much tougher job than he expected, and does not disguise the
fact that he was glad when it was over; he also adds, that whoever fights
Jones in future will find he must put up with a good deal more punching
than will do him good. Many persons found fault with Paddock for dropping
on several occasions after delivering his right on Jones’s most vulnerable
point, the ribs, and certainly we agree that such a practice should have
<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pageno">287</span>
been avoided. It must be remembered, however, that Paddock was himself
seriously injured, and fast growing blind, and that he could scarcely
be expected to display that coolness which under more favourable circumstances
would have been expected from him. These dropping manœuvres
were also in a material degree counterbalanced by his manly conduct in
the eleventh round, when he refrained from punishing Jones, when the
latter was in a defenceless but perfectly fair position for being hit.</p>

<p>Our hero was allowed scant breathing-time after this tremendous
encounter. At the giving up of the stakes at Mr. Jackson’s, King Street
Mews, Park Lane, on the following Tuesday, the fearless Tom Sayers
presented himself and proposed a battle for £200, catch-weight, but the
details were postponed to a future meeting at Bill Hayes’s in the ensuing
week. In the interval Tom’s friends had entered into what the politicians
call <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pourparlers</span> with some friends of Harry Poulson, and this proved “a
red herring” that crossed the “line,” and so the match with Tom Sayers
was for the present a lost “scent.”</p>

<p>In the papers of August 27, we read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The gallant Tom Paddock having waited for some time for a reply to
the question we put to the Tipton Slasher, as to whether he intends to
maintain his claim to the Championship, and having seen no answer,
declares that if Perry has retired&mdash;&#8203;as he is at a loss to know which of these
worthies is actual Champion&mdash;&#8203;he will fight Harry Broome for £200 or
£300 a side.” [We may state, for Paddock’s information, that Broome,
when he forfeited some time back to the Slasher, declared his intention
of retiring from the Ring, and leaving the title to the Tipton.]
“Paddock adds that if neither Perry nor Broome takes up the gauntlet,
he shall consider himself Champion, as prepared to meet all comers.”</p>

<p>In the following week’s issue, the Editor announces that Johnny Broome
has called on him, and left a deposit to “find a man” who will fight
Paddock for £200, or any larger sum.</p>

<p>As the day of the battle approached, the interest in the expected encounter
increased, and the eighteenth deposit, carrying the stakes up to
£160, being duly posted at Alec Keene’s, “Three Tuns,” Moor Street,
Soho, all seemed going fairly. On the following Tuesday, however, an
alarming intelligence reached Air Street, that Harry had been apprehended
at his training quarters at Patcham, and taken before the Brighton magistrates,
by whom he had been bound over to keep the peace for three
months, thus putting an end to hostilities for that period at least. We
<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pageno">288</span>
shall not here encumber our pages by any detail of the angry “’fending
and proving” which followed this very mysterious arrest, of which each
sought to cast the blame on his opponent’s party. On this occasion the
Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, who was the stakeholder, declared it to be his duty,
from documents laid before him, to hand over to Paddock the £180
deposited, which was done on the 20th of February, 1855. Hereupon
Broome deposited £10 for a fresh match, to come off on May 7th,
after the expiry of Harry’s recognisances, which Paddock covered, and
once again received forfeit from his wrangling opponent on the 12th of
March. Hereupon the “highest authority” declared, “in answer to
numerous correspondents,” that “Tom Paddock is now Champion
of England, until the position is wrested from him by the Tipton Slasher
or Aaron Jones, or confirmed to him by their defeat.” And here we may
note that “old K-legs” was still “pegging away on the same line;” but
the ruddy hero of Redditch fancied Aaron Jones to be an easier job, so he
postponed his old friend’s invitation, and joined issue with Jones by signing
articles on April 3rd, at Bill Hayes’s, the “Crown,” in Cranbourne
Passage, to fight on the 26th of June, 1855, for £100 a side, within
70 and over 50 miles from London. As we were present on the previous
Thursday, at Dan Dismore’s, and ourselves registered the “ring-constables”
for preservation of order on the occasion, it may be interesting to
print our note. Those who gave in their names were: Nat Langham,
Edward Hoiles (the Spider), Tom Sayers, Jack Grant, Jemmy Welsh,
Young Sambo (Welsh), Jemmy Massey, Billy Duncan, Charley Mallett,
John Hicks, Alf. Walker, Tom Adams, and Ned More; Ned Adams,
Inspector. All these were provided with armlets and a number, and were
empowered to prevent any person intruding within the outer roped circle,
unless provided with an inner-ring ticket, purchased of them individually
or of the appointed distributors. Each of these constables was compensated
by an “honorarium” in proportion to the receipts for “privilege”
tickets, which was subject to deduction or fines for proved remissness or
breach of duty. These arrangements fell into confusion and almost into
oblivion when the master-hand which framed them retired from the conduct
of the affairs of the Ring, of which he had been, through good report or
evil report, through sunshine as through storm, “the guide, philosopher,
and friend”&mdash;&#8203;nay, more, the disinterested and zealous champion and advocate.
We allude to Vincent Dowling, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, who for more than thirty
years edited <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>, and to whom the hand which writes
<a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a><span class="pageno">289</span>
these lines is proud to own that that teacher was the Gamaliel at whose
feet he sat to learn the now forgotten and self-degraded principles of
honour, courage, forbearance, and fair play embodied in and inculcated by
the Art of Self-Defence. On this occasion the law survived the law-giver,
and the most perfect order was maintained. On the former occasion
Jones’s friends declared that their man lost the use of his left hand from an
injury to his collar-bone in the tenth round, and moreover, that he was
suffering from a disablement brought on by undue exertion, for which the
application of leeches had been considered necessary only a day or two
before the fight. If, they argued, Jones could under these drawbacks,
prolong the fight for two hours and twenty-four minutes, to the 121st
round, the chances were now in his favour. Besides, Jones, on a recent
occasion (at Jem Ward’s benefit) had so unmistakably “bested” Master
Tom, flooring him in masterly style, that his friends were “legion” for this
second trial. For some time after the signature of articles both men
remained in town, but at length Aaron betook himself to Shrewsbury,
where he remained until a fortnight before the fight, when he came up to
London, and took up his quarters at Sutton, in Surrey, under the surveillance
of Bob Fuller, who, “it goes without saying,” did all that could be
done to bring him “fit to the post.” Paddock went to the neighbourhood
of Leatherhead, where, by strong exercise on the breezy downs, he did all
that could be done to bring his “pipes” and muscle into the primest order.
We saw him both at the Epsom and Ascot meetings, to each of which he
came on “Shanks’s mare” and certainly looked in “wind and limb,” eye,
skin, and general complexion, up to anything. On the Monday previous
both men showed at the Rotunda, Blackfriars Road, at the gathering for
the benefit of the Pugilistic Benevolent Association, and of course received
the congratulations of the crowd.</p>

<p>The “special” was chartered on this occasion by Dan Dismore, Hayes,
Mr. Jackson, and Paddock’s backer. On our arrival at the terminus we
met an immense assemblage of curious folks, who unable to be present at
the fight were anxious to get a peep at the men. On the platform was a
goodly concourse, noblemen and soldiers, Corinthians and clergy (at any
rate, we noticed the “Bishop of Bond Street,” carefully superintending the
safe deposit of sundry Fortnum-and-Mason-looking baskets and hampers
in the guard’s van), sporting pubs, country-cousins, pugilists, and many
well-breeched plebeians. At a few minutes past eight o’clock, both men
with their immediate attendants were comfortably seated, and at half-past
<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span class="pageno">290</span>
eight the whistle sounded and away we steamed. The well-known stations
on the Eastern Counties were quickly passed, and, with the exception
of one stoppage for a “drink” for the iron horse, we had covered nearly
eighty miles from Shoreditch before we put on the brakes, and pulled up
near Mildenhall, in the county of Suffolk. Here an excellent piece of
ground had been selected, and a first-rate inner-and-outer-ring were quickly
marked out by Tom Oliver, Tom Callas, and assistants. A brisk trade in
tickets for the outer enclosure showed a receipt of £33 10s., a very fair
contribution to the funds of the P.B.A. The heat, as the men stripped for
the encounter, was intense, and by an amicable agreement the usual toss
for corners was dispensed with, and the men “placed across the sun;” thus
neither had the disadvantage of advancing to the scratch with the rays of
that dazzling luminary in his face. At half-past twelve o’clock, the number
of spectators numbering a little over a thousand, Jones threw in his cap,
attended by Bob Fuller and Bill Hayes, the latter, who was in ill-health,
resigning his position soon afterwards to Jerry Noon. Paddock soon followed,
Alec Keene and Jemmy Massey acting as his assistants. Paddock,
after shaking hands, offered £25 in crisp bank notes to Aaron, on condition
of a deposit of £20 on the part of the latter, but Jones declined the wager.
The odds round the ring were now at this figure&mdash;&#8203;5 to 4 on Paddock.
Jemmy Massey, however, offering “3 to 2, rather than not get on,” had his
£15 taken against £10, and the market-price went back again.</p>

<p>As the men stood up Paddock looked red, hard, and, contrary to former
exhibitions, sinewy and comparatively lean, with a look of wear and tear
about him that spoke well for his attention to training. Jones was fine,
symmetrical, and a model for a statuary; but though he smiled and looked
healthy and confident, we could not bring ourselves to think he could last
out a day’s work with the Redditch man. At six minutes to one the
seconds retired and business began.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock was evidently not
disposed to make a waiting race; he approached
his man with an ominous smile,
and at once launched forth his left, which
was prettily stopped. He tried it a second
time, but Jones was away. Tom would not
be denied, but dashed resolutely in, and
caught Jones heavily on the mouth with his
left. Jones turned half round and went
down, bleeding from the lips. (<em>First blood</em>
for Paddock. First knock-down blow was
also claimed, but not allowed by the referee,
who considered that Jones was a consenting
party to his own downfall.)</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock again tried his left, catching
Aaron a second time on the mouth. This
led to some heavy exchanges, in which
Paddock got it on the left cheek heavily,
and Jones in the mouth. Paddock in the
end slipped down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;The men at once got within distance,
and heavy counter-hits left and right were
exchanged, Jones with the latter hand
catching Tom another spank on the left
<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span class="pageno">291</span>
cheek, and receiving on the left peeper and
ribs. A close followed, in which both were
down, Jones under.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock came up smiling, when Jones
let go his left heavily on Paddock’s larboard
optic, and his right on his nose&mdash;&#8203;a very
heavy hit, which produced a good supply of
red currant juice, and both fell.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock dashed in, but was met with
another smasher on the snout. He retaliated
on Aaron’s left eye, inflicting a cut on
the brow, and drawing a fresh tap. He
made his left again on Aaron’s cheek, which
led to heavy exchanges, left and right, both
getting it on the left side of the nut, and
Paddock at the close fell on his south pole.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Jones came up with his left peeper in
mourning; Paddock’s sinister visual organ
had on a similar suit. Paddock determinedly
rattled in and tickled Aaron on the
left side of his occiput. He tried a second
dose, but napped an ugly right-hander on
the left eyebrow, which was cut, and the
ruby at once responded to the call. Heavy
exchanges without an attempt to stop followed,
and both were down, Paddock
under.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Both showed serious marks of punishment,
but neither said “nay.” Some heavy
rambling exchanges took place, and Jones
slipped down.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;No ceremony on either side, but ding-dong
was the order of the day. The exchanges
were in favour of Paddock, who
paid some heavy to visitations Aaron’s left
peeper. In the close both were down.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Jones attempted to lead off, but Paddock
got cleverly away; Jones followed
him up, and some tremendous exchanges
took place, Jones in the end knocking Paddock
off his legs by a tremendous crack
from his right on the jaw. (First knock-down
blow for Jones.)</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock looked serious&mdash;&#8203;he was
evidently shaken by the hit in the last
round. Jones, however, instead of going
to work, waited for him. Paddock quickly
recovered, and just touched Aaron on
the proboscis; this brought on a rally,
in which little mischief was done, and Jones
got down.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock took the lead, planted a
left-hander on Jones’s left daylight; Jones
retaliated by a right-hander on the same
spot, and then a second edition of the same,
and in getting back fell on the ropes; he
was not down, and Paddock might with
fairness have struck him, but, with a manly
feeling, for which he is entitled to much
credit, walked to his own corner amidst
cheers from both sides.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;This was a tremendous fighting
round. It commenced with some heavy
exchanges left and right, Paddock reaching
Aaron’s left eye, and the latter pounding
Tom on the smeller. A break away, followed
by some severe counter-hits in favour
of Jones, who again drew Tom’s cork,
brought them to a close, in which both were
down. Paddock distilling the ruby from his
nose and left eye, and Jones from the nozzle.
(The facetious Jerry Noon remarked that it
was “Chelsea Hospital to a sentry-box” on
Jones.)</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Jones led off, caught Tom another
nasty one on the side of his knowledge-box,
and Tom, astonished at its suddenness,
dropped.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock tried his left, which was
neatly stopped. Again did he make the attempt
with a like result, but Jones with
quickness planted his right on the damaged
left eye with effect, and Paddock fell, Jones
on him.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Tom came up with his left shutter
nearly closed, and the cheek on the same
side as big as a pumpkin. He attempted to
lead off, but was again well stopped. He
would persevere, and got home on Jones’s
left ogle. Jones countered heavily on the
same point, and Paddock again got down,
Jones on him.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Jones rushed at his man, who in retreating
fell.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock led off, but missed. Tremendous
counter-hits followed, Paddock
getting it on the side of his nut from Jones’s
right, and Jones being knocked off his legs
by a heavy visitation on his left cheek,
which inflicted a severe cut and spilled more
of the vital fluid.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock again missed a well-intended
left hander, and, after a few scrambling exchanges,
Jones fell weak. He had evidently
not recovered the terrific hit in the last
round.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock let go his left, which caught
Jones on the damaged chop, but not heavily.
Jones returned on the left eye, and Paddock
dropped laughing.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock went to his man, who let go
his left on the side of his head, and Paddock
fell. He jumped up to renew the
round, when Jones at once went to work,
pegged away left and right, drawing some
more claret from the left eye. Paddock returned
on the left cheek, but in the end was
knocked through the ropes, Jones falling
weak from his own exertions.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock’s lead was again stopped,
and Jones again propped him on the left
cheek. Paddock dropped, and once more
jumped up to renew the round, but Jones’s
seconds forced him away to his owner.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Jones, slightly recovered from his
weakness, went to work, and some tremendous
counter-hits were exchanged, Paddock
on the left eye, and Jones on the smelling
bottle. Paddock now shoved in his right
heavily on Jones’s ribs, and dropped, amidst
cries of “Foul.” No appeal, however, was
made, and the affair passed off.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock came up with his left ocular
completely closed, the opposite cheek being
swollen as if from sympathy. Jones’s left
eye was also barely open. Paddock went
<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><span class="pageno">292</span>
resolutely to work with both hands, Jones
retaliating, and in the end Jones fell.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock took the lead by another
essay upon Jones’s head, which staggered
him. Paddock at once closed, threw, and
fell on him.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Slight changes to a close, in which a
little mutual fibbing took place. In the end
both down, Paddock under, but still much
the fresher man.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Jones attempted to open the pleadings,
but Paddock stepped back, jobbing
him on the snuffbox as he came in. Slogging
exchanges now took place, in favour of
Jones, who caught Paddock a tremendous
right hander behind the left ear, which cut
that organ severely, and opened a new
crimson conduit. The men closed and fell
together, Jones under.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, although bleeding from
the left ear and eye, came up merrily, and
led off with the left on Aaron’s os frontis.
Jones returned with a heavy right hander
on Tom’s darkened peeper, and again
knocked him off his pins.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, who was very slow to the
call of time, came up weak. Jones led off,
with his right on the nose, but had not
devil enough to let it go with a will. Paddock
retreated until he had shaken off the
effects of the knock-down in the last round,
and then caught Jones heavily on the body.
Jones returned on the mouth with effect,
the blow turning Paddock half round.
Paddock at once walked to his corner and
sat down&mdash;&#8203;an example followed by Jones.
This hit was very severe, and many persons
thought Paddock would not come many
more rounds.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock tried to lead off, but was
stopped. Jones then planted his left
slightly on the right cheek, and Paddock
got down.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;Jones went to work, but without
force, and after some slight exchanges, both
fell on their knees exhausted. The intense
heat must have been indeed distressing to
both.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Slight exchanges, in which little
mischief was done, and Paddock again
down.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;Both attempted to deliver, and both
missed their mark. Slight exchanges, each
on the left side of the nut, and both down
fatigued.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;Jones essayed a lead, which was
neatly stopped. He then dashed in, and
after a scrambling rally both fell over the
ropes.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock’s head presented an unique
specimen of Aaron’s handiwork. The left
cheek was swollen as big as a cocoa-nut, and
his eye was all but covered up. With the
other optic he glared furiously upon his opponent,
and rushing at him, delivered his
left on the cheek. Jones returned slightly
on the body, and Tom dropped.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock stopped Aaron’s left. Paddock
returned twice heavily on the ribs with
his right, leaving visible impression of his
knuckles, and then dropped without a return,
amidst the hisses of the Aaronites.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock’s left well stopped. A tremendous
ding-dong rally then took place,
in which Paddock got it on the left eye and
cheek, and Jones on the ribs. In the end
both down.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock’s left again stopped, and
Jones returned on the side of the wig-block.
Paddock then popped in his left with effect
on the mouth, and after some more exchanges
Paddock got down. He looked
round anxiously at Jones, as he was being
carried to his corner, and evidently wished
his work was done.</p>

<p>     38.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock made his right heavily on
Jones’s body, and then his left on the side
of his head. Both now pegged away with
determination, and in a most unflinching
way, as if they had received fresh vigour.
The hitting, however, was in favour of
Paddock, and in the end Jones fell weak. It
had evidently been an expiring effort on his
part to get a decided lead, and having failed
it was now patent to all that his defeat was
a mere question of time.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock let go his left on the side of
Aaron’s cheek, which led to some severe
counter-hits. They then closed, and Paddock
pegged away with his right at the ribs
until both were down.</p>

<p>     40.&mdash;&#8203;Some slight exchanges, without mischief,
and Jones down.</p>

<p>     41.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock came up with an awful grin;
his single open peeper glaring in a most ludicrous
manner. He tried to lead off, but
napped it on the smeller and left ear, from
which the main was again tuned on. Paddock
then made his right on the ribs, and
Jones dropped.</p>

<p>     42.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock again effected a heavy right-handed
delivery on the ribs, and after slight
exchanges both were down.</p>

<p>     43.&mdash;&#8203;Slight exchanges, in which neither
was effective, and in a scramble they fell.
Paddock under.</p>

<p>     44.&mdash;&#8203;Jones attempted to lead off, but was
easily stopped; Paddock returning heavily
on his left eye, and then on the body, again
screwed his courage to the sticking-place,
and a second with his right and got down.</p>

<p>     45.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock led off, but was short. In
another attempt he reached Aaron’s damaged
bread-basket, and dropped à la Bendigo.
He jumped up to renew the fight, when Jones
nailed him on the left side of his brain-pan,
and Tom finally dropped to end this round.</p>

<p>     46.&mdash;&#8203;Jones tried to lead, but was very
slow, and easily stopped. Paddock again
reached his ribs with his right, and a sharpish
rally ended in their failing together at
the ropes.</p>

<p>     47.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock’s left was out of distance;
he tried his right at the body but missed,
and Jones dashing in, caught him on the
right cheek slightly, and fell on his face.
</p>
<a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a><span class="pageno">293</span>

<p>     48.&mdash;&#8203;Counter-hits with the left, Paddock
catching Jones very heavily on the left
temple, and dropping him as if shot.</p>

<p>     49.&mdash;&#8203;Jones, very slow to the call of time,
at length came up wildly. He staggered in
to close, and they fell, Jones under.</p>

<p>     50.&mdash;&#8203;Jones, alter a futile attempt to
punish, fell weak.</p>

<p>     51.&mdash;&#8203;Slight exchanges, but no mischief,
and both down.</p>

<p>     52.&mdash;&#8203;Wild, swinging hits which did not
get home. Paddock then planted his right
heavily on the ribs, and again got down,
amidst loud hisses. There was no appeal
to the referee, and the fight proceeded.</p>

<p>     53.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock let go his left on the mouth;
slight exchanges followed, and they then fell
on their backs. Both were much exhausted,
but Paddock was the stronger on his pins.</p>

<p>     54.&mdash;&#8203;After slight exchanges, Paddock
again made his right at the ribs, and got
down.</p>

<p>     55.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock led off, but was stopped.
They then got close, and some slight fibbing
ended in Jones seeking Mother Earth. Paddock
stood looking at him, as much as to
say, “Why don’t you cut it?” until he was
carried to his corner.</p>

<p>     56.&mdash;&#8203;Jones attempted to lead off, but Paddock
countered him heavily on the cheek,
and he fell, amidst cries of “Take him
away.”</p>

<p>     57.&mdash;&#8203;Jones, although slow to time, came
up steadily, and succeeded in putting in a
little one “on the place where Tom’s eye
ought to be,” and having received in return
on the proboscis, he fell on his latter end.</p>

<p>     58.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock rushed in to finish, but
Jones, to the surprise of all, stopped him,
and some heavy counter-hits took place.
Paddock getting another crack on his disfigured
nob, and hitting Jones down by a
spank on the dice-box.</p>

<p>     59.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock planted his left on Jones’s
kissing-organ heavily, opening a fresh tap,
and Aaron again dropped. For two more
rounds did Jones stagger up to the scratch,
but it was only to receive&mdash;&#8203;all the steel was
out of him&mdash;&#8203;he was extremely weak on his
legs, one eye was closed, and the other following
suit; his nose, mouth, and ribs were
severely damaged, while Paddock&mdash;&#8203;although
tremendously disfigured about the title-page&mdash;&#8203;had
still a little “go” left in his trotters.
Every one begged of Jones or his
seconds on his behalf to give in, but the
gallant fellow persevered against hope until
the close of the 61st round, when getting
another heavy crack on the mouth, he fell,
almost senseless, and his seconds threw up
the sponge in token of defeat, at the end of
one hour and twenty-nine minutes. Poor
Aaron, who had done all he could do to turn
the tide in his favour, was much mortified
by this second defeat at the hands of Paddock,
and cried like a child. He could
scarcely walk on leaving the ring, and was
obliged to lie down on an adjacent bank for
some time before he could be removed to the
station. Paddock was no great shakes, and
was evidently much delighted that his task
was at an end. He went into the ring with
a full conviction that he should not gain a
bloodless victory, and that he should get
his brain-pan pretty well knocked about,
but we question whether even he, confident
as he was, anticipated that it would be quite
so “hot” as it turned out.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Every one who witnessed the
above battle will cordially agree with us
that it was a determined, manly struggle for
pre-eminence throughout. It clearly demonstrated
to our mind, however, the fact that
Jones does not possess sufficient physique to
enable him to contend successfully against
such a hardy bit of stuff as Tom Paddock.
True, he is a harder hitter than Paddock,
but then, after a time, unless a man has a
frame of iron, this gift is materially diminished
by the constant jar; and a determined
adversary, with such a granite nob as Tom
Paddock, capable of receiving almost any
amount of punishment, is almost certain to
last longest at mere give-and-take fighting,
as was fully proved on Tuesday. Jones,
notwithstanding he had received hints from
the most accomplished boxer of the day, Jem
Ward, still persevered in his old system of hitting
principally with his right-hand, a practice
which, although it altered Paddock’s physiognomy
in the most extraordinary manner
on one side, still was not calculated, unattended
as it was by much execution from his
left, to reduce his opponent to a state of
darkness. He punished Paddock more than
that hero was ever punished before, and we
believe that, did he possess more wear and
tear, it would have been a much nearer thing
than it was. He had for some time the best
of the hitting, but, falling weak, the inequality
was quickly removed by the determination
of Paddock, who, seeing that he had
his work to do, never gave Jones breathing
time to collect his faculties.</p>

<p>The Old Tipton being matched with Aaron Jones, and Harry Broome

be contested for man to man, and never obtained upon a mere challenge. To prove that I
mean to carry out what I state, I will meet Paddock at your office on Wednesday, Dec. 12,
to sign articles, to which the following condition must be attached:&mdash;&#8203;The money not, under
any circumstances, to be parted with until <em>fairly won or lost</em> in a 24 feet roped ring.
Should this not suit Paddock (not that I wish to interfere with the match between the
Tipton Slasher and Aaron Jones) I will fight Aaron Jones for £200 a side, whether he wins
or loses with the Tipton Slasher. By inserting this, you will oblige.&mdash;&#8203;Yours, &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="pneg">“Bell’s Life” Tavern, Strand,<br />
&emsp;&emsp;November 28, 1855.</p>
</div><!--end letter-->

<p>Paddock lost no time in calling on the stakeholder, and leaving £10
early in the next week, under condition that if he could not raise £200,
they should meet for £100. Broome did not flinch, and, after two more
“conditional” deposits, articles were signed in the editorial sanctum of
<cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, by which Thomas Paddock and Henry Broome mutually bound
themselves to fight for £200 a side, on Monday, May 19th, 1856, within
100 and over 50 miles from London. The anxiety in boxing circles, as the
day drew near and all was found progressing smoothly to the desired issue,
became intense; and Alec Keene’s “Three Tuns,” in Moor Street, whence
Paddock was backed, and Harry’s own house, the newly named “Bell’s
Life” Tavern (now the “Norfolk Arms”), in the Strand, were crowded
with curious inquirers as to how the men went on, and for “the straight
tip.” On the day previous both champions showed, and the distribution of
colours&mdash;&#8203;a blue with white spot for Broome, and a blue with a white
check for Paddock&mdash;&#8203;on the usual terms of a guinea or “nothing,” was
extensive. Paddock was closely scrutinised by both friends and foes, each
equally anxious to ascertain whether time or previous contests had impaired
his freshness or vigour; but no traces of deterioration were there, and those
who felt his muscle declared their belief that he was never in finer trim.</p>

<p>Harry’s appearance, so far as his face was concerned, was that of perfect
health, and the disappearance of the protuberance which had long been
visible under his waistcoat was remarkable. These signs of careful training,
with the prestige of his name, carried the odds to 6 and 7 to 4 in his
favour. We knew that he worked hard and was most creditably abstemious;
but we feared, as the sequel proved, that he was unable to train efficiently,
<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><span class="pageno">295</span>
and that strength was lost in the great reduction of weight to which he had
been subjected.</p>

<p>It had been the original intention of the backers of the men to have
given the inhabitants of Kent and Sussex the opportunity of a view of this
encounter; but it proved, upon inquiry, that it was impossible to obtain a
“special” on those lines, as some saints in the directorate of the companies
had issued an ukase against such “excursions” as were not to their own
taste or under their own patronage. Recourse was, therefore, had to the
Eastern Counties, where the necessary facilities for an excursion of “Odd
Fellows” was applied for and granted. It was suggested to the “managers”
of the “outing”&mdash;&#8203;Alec Keene, Fred Broome, and Dan Dismore&mdash;&#8203;that any
invasion of the territory of Cambridge, Huntingdon, or the country round
Mildenhall or Brandon, would inevitably be resisted; so these worthies,
after consultation with experienced strategists, deemed it prudent to abandon
the old and beaten track, and strike out a new plan of campaign. The
company’s agent was, therefore, apprised that the excursionists wished to
pass through Suffolk into Norfolk, by the Eastern Union Line, as their
place of reunion would be a few miles beyond Ipswich. The officials made
their arrangements accordingly, and on our arrival at the Shoreditch
terminus, at eight o’clock on Monday morning, we found that no pains had
been spared to prevent anything like crushing or disorder at the doors.
The neighbourhood of the station was, as usual, crowded with anxious
spectators, who hoped to get a view of the principals in the forthcoming
duel; but, so far as Broome was concerned, they were disappointed, as he
had proceeded at an early hour to Stratford, where it was arranged the
train should stop and pick him up. Paddock, however, accompanied by
Jemmy Massey and Alec Keene, was early at the starting-place, and was
eagerly greeted by the multitude. From the heavy tariff which had been
determined on, we fully expected to find the company not only very select,
but far from numerous, and we anticipated that the original number of
carriages ordered would have been found sufficient; but such was the rush
of the public, that, long before the hour of starting, every carriage was
filled, and chiefly by respectable persons. It was soon perceptible that a
considerable addition to the conveyances was required, and no less than
seven extra carriages were added, all of which filled almost immediately;
and, not only so, but very shortly after the special had started a sufficient
number of gentlemen arrived at the station to charter another train of some
four or five carriages, to follow that containing the belligerents. Among
<a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a><span class="pageno">296</span>
the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageurs</span> by the first train were almost all the pugilists of note, and
an immense number of Corinthians of every grade. In fact,
a larger muster of the higher classes we have not seen on such an
occasion for many years. There were one or two familiar faces missing,
but there were quite sufficient new hands to make up for the deficiency.
Among the company was an Indian prince of high rank, and his suite,
anxious to obtain a glimpse of the peculiarly national spectacle, and we
were delighted to hear that he was treated throughout with the greatest
respect, and suffered not the slightest indignity from the thoughtless throng
on account of his peculiar appearance or unaccustomed manners; a piece of
good behaviour on the part of an unpoliced crowd that was a creditable
example to those public gatherings which pretend to superior order and
civility. The only complaint we heard on the way down was on the subject
of the commissariat, the want of “belly-timber” being universally
felt. It turned out that the absence of refreshment among the Corinthians
was attributable to the pressure of a certain class at the doors of the station,
who, unwilling to pay, and anxious to get a trip for nothing, besieged
the doors at the latest moment, in the hope of taking the officials
off their guard, and so making a rush for the platform. The formidable
appearance of this phalanx induced the police of the line to close the
doors and refuse admission to all. Unluckily, amongst the late arrivals,
was Mr. Commissary Dismore, who, with his Land Transport Corps, well
provided with everything necessary, arrived just too late. Dan himself
contrived to get round by a private way on to the platform, but, alas! the
“vital ammunition” was cut off. Thanks, however, to the second special,
the provisions were brought down in time for the hungry and thirsty souls
to refresh themselves after the mill, when due justice was done to Dan’s
ample provision. The first special did not leave Shoreditch until a quarter
past nine; it reached Stratford about half-past; and here Harry Broome
and his friends were picked up. Harry’s mug looked hard and healthy,
and about his mouth was a smile of confidence. The universal exclamation
was, “How well he looks!” and the short glimpse obtained of him
induced many persons to “open” at offers of 7 to 4 on him&mdash;&#8203;offers which
the friends of Paddock were not slow to accept. The train now sped on
at a good pace to Chelmsford, where water was taken in, and we again
set forward on our journey. At Manningtree, where a second refresher
was necessary for the engine, an intimation was received that the “war
hawks” were abroad, and that the Ipswich police had, through the indiscretion
<a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a><span class="pageno">297</span>
of some would-be-clever persons, who had gone on over night,
obtained a scent of what was intended, and had telegraphed to the police
at Diss, in Norfolk, and other places, to be on the look-out. This intimation
arrived most opportunely, and it was at once resolved to put on the
double, and to bring off the mill as close as possible to Ipswich, where
it was least expected. The commander-in-chief mounted the engine, and,
under his direction, a likely spot was selected, where the train was brought
to a halt, and the assembled multitude, to the number of at least five hundred,
dropped upon the field like a flight of crows. Several of the committee
of the P.B.A. at once spread themselves about the field in skirmishing
order to select the best spot, but while they were so engaged the Commissary
and Callas had pitched upon a place which, although not the best,
was still tolerably level, and the grass was not very long. Here no time
was lost in getting up the fixings. It was uncertain how long the Ipswich
“blues” would be hoodwinked, and, therefore, time was everything. A
large outer-ring was formed simultaneously with the original circle, and
round this the non-paying part of the community quickly ranged themselves.
The business of selling inner-ring tickets proceeded briskly, and a sum of
£47 was realised thereby, the surplus of which, after paying ring-keepers
and the farmer on whose grounds the mill took place for damage to his
grass, went to the funds of the Association. So great was the number of
privilege ticket-holders that, on sitting down at some distance from the ring,
they formed a double row almost the whole way round, and effectually
proved their own barrier against the irruption of those who at all times
are more free than welcome. It is true that several of the latter class,
by some means, obtained access to Broome’s corner later on, where their
vociferations were the reverse of agreeable; but, thanks to the exertions
of Mike Madden, Bill Barry, and Fred Mason, they were effectually kept
within bounds. At length, by a quarter to one, everything was in apple-pie
order, and the signal being given, the men at once stepped into the
arena; Harry Broome attended by Tass Parker and Tom Sayers, and
Paddock under the surveillance of the accomplished Alec Keene and Jemmy
Massey. They smiled and shook hands, Harry shaking his nut in a significant
manner at Tom, as much as to say, “I’ve got you at last, old fellow.”
The colours were now tied to the post, and while the men were preparing
their toilet a good deal of betting took place. The first offer was
£35 to £20 on Broome&mdash;&#8203;a bet which was at once made and staked. 7 to
4 was then laid very freely, the business of booking and staking going on
<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span class="pageno">298</span>
most briskly. Massey now came forward and offered to take £20 to £10,
but not being able to get a higher bid than £15 to £10, he closed, and this
amount was staked, as was also a similar bet laid to Alec Keene. The
layers now began to hang back, and £30 to £20 became the current odds,
at which a good deal more business was done. A heavier amount of betting
we never remember to have witnessed at the ring-side; and this tended, more
than anything else, to show the intense interest the battle excited. At
length, offers became more languid, and finally ceased altogether; and as
we did not hear of a single bet after the mill commenced, we are inclined
to think that the speculators had staked every farthing they brought with
them. By one o’clock it was announced that both men were quite ready,
and time being called they were led to the scratch, where, after the usual
hands across, they were left, peeled to the buff, and their proportions and
condition displayed to the curious gaze of the assembled throng.</p>

<p>Tom Paddock, as he stood at the scratch, looked every inch a gladiator.
Each thew and sinew was perfectly developed, and seemed ready to burst
the tightened skin. His broad shoulders and deep chest, covered with
ponderous muscles, were the admiration of all; and the distinctness with
which his lower ribs were visible proved that there was not an ounce of
superfluous flesh on his wiry, powerful frame. His mug was hard and
ruddy, and there was clearly little there to swell up should his dial come
in too close propinquity to Harry’s sledge-hammers. He looked good-humoured,
but determined, and evidently feeling the importance of the
occasion, he toed the scratch with a determination to “do or die.” Widely
different was the aspect presented by the once powerful Harry Broome.
True it was that he had got rid of his superabundant belly, but in doing so
it was apparent to all that he had also got rid of much of his muscle and
sinew. When he fought Harry Orme he was certainly well covered with
fat, but still underneath this coating the evidences of great power were
plainly visible; but now, what a falling off was there! Barring the aforesaid
protuberance, he was as fat as ever, but all appearances of sinewy
strength had vanished. His breasts were soft and puffy, his arms round
and smooth, while the flesh on his once fine back hung in collops; there
was also a slight eruption on his pale skin, which betokened a feverish
state of the blood, which would not have been guessed from the appearance
of his face. He said he felt quite well, though not so strong as on former
occasions. On inquiring of Joe Bostock, who had been with him while he
finished his training at Bosham, near Chichester, we learned that he had
<a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a><span class="pageno">299</span>
several times complained of weakness, and that the more he tried to get his
fat off the more did it seem to accumulate. Harry himself informed us, and
we are satisfied as to the truth of his statement, that he reduced himself
upwards of 3<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> in the course of his exercise, but he found himself getting
so weak that he was compelled at last to be more gentle in his work; and
he now declares his belief that had he gone into the ring in his ordinary
state, without any preparation whatever, he would have been better and
stronger than he was on Monday. With all his drawbacks, however, he
was extremely confident as to the result of the battle, and advised his
friends to back him at all hazards. He no doubt depended upon his
science, and expected to set at defiance the well-known onslaughts of his
opponent. We must now bring these preliminaries to a conclusion, and
proceed to our account of</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Precisely at six minutes past
one the onslaught commenced. Broome, to
the astonishment of all, did not assume the
elegant attitude we have seen in former
battles, but feinted and dodged about without
gathering himself together in the least.
Tom was evidently surprised, and thought
he must be “kidding;” he therefore assumed
a defensive position, and bided his time.
He had not long to wait. Harry was bent
on forcing an opening, and dashed in,
feinted with his left, ducked his head, and
lodged his left heavily on Tom’s breadbasket.
His nut was laid open to a severe
upper cut, but Tom, bewildered, did not
see, and therefore did not take the advantage
of his opening. Broome now came
again, let fly his left at the forehead, inflicting
no damage, napped a little one on
the left brow, and slipped down.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock at once rattled in, let go his
left with great quickness on the proboscis,
drawing first blood. Broome returned on
the left cheek, and also elicited a supply of
the ruby. Harry then closed, and tried to
throw his man, but, after a short struggle,
in which Tom was very busy with his right
at close quarters, Tom slipped from his
grasp and fell.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, out of all form, tried to take
a lead, but in vain. Paddock was too quick
for him, and pegged away heavily left and
right on the conk, inflicting a cut on the
bridge thereof, drawing more fluid. Broome
again closed, and Tom resorted to his fibbing
system with both hands heavily on the side
of Harry’s nut, and on his ribs. This effectually
put a stop to any chance of his being
thrown, and in the end both fell side by
side.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Broome dashed in, let fly his left,
which missed; slight exchanges with the
same hand followed, and Paddock slipped
down. He jumped up immediately to renew
the round, but Jemmy Massey squeezed
him in his arms as if he were a child, and
carried him struggling to his corner.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Broome came up puffing, and evidently
out of sorts. Paddock, fresh as a daisy,
grinned a ghastly grin, and awaited the onslaught.
Harry tried his left, when Tom
countered him heavily on the snout, drawing
more of the crimson. Tom attempted to
follow up his advantage, but Harry turned
and ran away, Tom after him. On Broome
turning round, Tom again planted a little
one on the snuff box, and they once more
closed, and some infighting took place, in
which Broome received heavily on the body,
and Tom got a little one behind his left ear.
In the end Paddock slipped down.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Tom came up smiling. Broome at
once rushed in, and closed with his head
under Paddock’s arm. Here Tom held it
and pegged away at the ribs until both were
down, Broome blowing and apparently distressed.
The layers of odds even thus early
began to look excessively blue at the want
of precision of their pet, and his evident
lack of lasting powers.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Broome slow, tried a feint, when Tom
nabbed him with the left on the cheek, and
then with the same hand on the snout.
Harry at once closed, when Tom, as usual,
resorted to his fibbing, at which game
Harry joined issue, and each got it on the
nose and left cheek. In the end both again
down.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Tom led off with his left, a straight’un,
on the snuff box. Some rambling, scrambling
exchanges followed to a close, in which
both fell.
</p>
<a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a><span class="pageno">300</span>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Tom steadied himself, and let go his
left, but Harry countered him heavily on
the right cheek. Tom returned on the jaw
with his right, and in his hurry to get away
slipped down. Harry drew back his hand,
as if intending to deliver a spank, but prudently
withheld the blow.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Broome let go his left, but open-handed,
on Tom’s left peeper. Tom returned
on the sneezer, increasing the supply of the
carmine, and slipped down.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Tom feinted, but found Broome
ready for a shoot, and stepped back, Harry
after him. Tom now let fly his left
well on the nose. Harry rushed in to close,
and Tom resumed his fibbing on the dial
and ribs. In the end he slipped down to
avoid the fall.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Tom tried his left, but Harry stepped
back, and as Tom followed, delivered a
heavy right-hander on the mark, and then
his left heavily on the mouth, drawing the
Falernian, but fracturing one of the small
bones of his hand. Paddock at once got
down, and Harry walked to his corner.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Tom tried his left twice in succession,
but Harry jumped away, Tom, however,
persevered, and having got another little
one on the mouth, went in to close, but on
Broome grasping him slipped down.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Harry now tried it on, but Tom kept
away, and as Harry followed, gave him a
touch on the ribs with his left, and getting
a little one in return on the chin, dropped.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock dashed in without precision,
and after a scrambling rally, in which there
was more bustle than damage, he got
down.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Tom once more steadied himself, and
let go his left, but Harry cross-countered
him on the forehead. Tom now crept close,
and feinting with his left, drew Broome out,
and then knocked him off his pins by a
slashing right-handed cross-counter on the
jaw. (First knock-down blow for Paddock.)
The cheers of those who had taken the odds
were now vociferous.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Harry did not seem much the worse
for the crack in the last round, but came up
good humouredly, and at once dashed to a
close. Some sharp infighting took place,
followed by a break away. Tom came again,
and Harry nailed him very heavily on the
snout with his right, staggering him, and
drawing a plentiful supply of home-brewed.
Paddock quickly sought mother earth.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Tom showed a slight mark on the
left side of his beak, which was also swollen
and bleeding. He rushed in, when Harry
caught him on the left cheek, drawing more
blood. Tom returned the compliment
with interest on the smeller, a very heavy
spank, which once more knocked the gallant
Harry off his perpendicular.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock feinted and let go his left
on the nozzle, got a little right-hander on
the left cheek in return, and slipped down,
grinning. He jumped up, however, and
said, “Have another round, Harry.” Harry
was ready, but Tom was once more borne
off by “the stunted Life Guardsman” (Massey).</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Tom rattled in again, caught Harry
on the nose, just between his eyes, removing
more bark, and drawing more claret.
Broome returned on the left cheek, and a
close followed, in which both pegged away,
until Tom fell on his knees, bleeding from
his scent-bottle. (Time 28 minutes.)</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock let go his left once more at
Harry’s proboscis, and some rapid but wild
exchanges followed, Harry hitting open-handed,
and Tom without judgment, and in
the end Tom slipped down.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Harry came up panting and bleeding
from the nose. Tom feinted, and Harry
turned away, but Tom, when he got near
enough, dashed out with his left very
straight and heavy on Harry’s mouth, inflicting
a severe cut, and turning on the tap.
Harry missed his return, but tried to make
a plant upon Tom. It was a failure, however&mdash;&#8203;he
seemed to have no steam in him&mdash;&#8203;and
Paddock once more dashed out his left
on the mug, increased the wound, and
again floored his brave antagonist.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Harry, although distressed, attempted
to take the lead with his right, his
left being apparently useless. He, however,
missed a terrific right-hander, and
napped a hot one on the nozzle in return.
Harry then got in a little one on the jaw,
and Tom got down cunning.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock led off with his left slightly
on the nose, which led to exchanges, Tom
again being at home on the snuff box, renewing
the stream. He got a right-hander
on the left listener, drawing the ruby, and
fell.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Harry’s mug, on coming up, was
much altered for the worse. His mouth
was much swollen and cut, and his nasal
organ was in not much better condition,
while a swelling was perceptible under his
left eye. Paddock had few marks of punishment,
and was as fresh as ever. Massey
offered to lay odds on him, but did not find
a response. Paddock made a feint, when
Harry turned and ran round the ring, Tom
after him. Harry then turned round, and
a close took place, in which, after some
slight fibbing, Paddock fell, receiving a right-hander
on the nut as he reached the ground.
(A claim of “foul,” which was not allowed.)</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Harry sparred a little for wind, and
Tom let fly his left, which was stopped. He
then closed, and Tom, as usual, pegged
away with both hands right merrily, thus
preventing any chance of a heavy fall. His
blows fell on Harry’s damaged kisser and
ribs. In the end Paddock slipped out of
Harry’s grasp and fell.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;The men feinted until they got close,
when tremendous right-handed counters
were exchanged, Tom getting home on the
snout, and Harry on the left cheek, and
Paddock down.
</p>
<a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a><span class="pageno">301</span>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Tom came up wild, and rushed in,
when Broome countered him again heavily
on the right peeper. Exchanges followed,
Harry getting another tap on his cutwater,
and, in the end, falling on his seat of
honour.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;Harry’s phiz was changing its appearance
every round. It was now much
out of shape in every way. Still, he persevered
against hope. He went in feinting
and dodging, whereupon Paddock went to
him, but Harry retreated, and, as Tom
rushed after him, nailed him with his right
on the ribs, and then with both mawleys,
the left open-handed, on the side of the nut,
and Tom slipped down.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;Harry rushed in to a close, and after
a sharp but short struggle, they fell side by
side. (Another claim of “foul,” on the
ground that Broome had hit his man when
down. Not allowed. Time, 40 minutes.)</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Tom went in with ardour, dropped
his left on the nozzle, and, after some wild
exchanges, fell.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;Tom again rushed in, and missing
his delivery, Broome closed, and Paddock
got down to avoid the fall.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock still on the rushing suit,
went in without judgment. Harry closed,
and some more sharp fibbing took place. It
was all in favour of Paddock, however, who
was evidently the more powerful man, and
punished poor Harry’s dial severely. In return
he got a few touches on the ribs, and
that was all. After a severe struggle they
rolled over, and a claim was made that Paddock
had kicked Broome while on the ground.
This claim, like those on the other side, was
justly declared by the referee to be groundless,
and the mill proceeded.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Tom feinted, and Harry bolted, pursued
by his opponent, who let go both hands
with quickness on the left ear, from which
blood was drawn, and on the mazzard,
and Harry fell through the ropes.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;Broome once more tried a lead, and
got well on Paddock’s jaw with his right;
he then closed, and, after a long struggle,
in which he could get no good hold, both
again fell together.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;Tom essayed a rush, and Harry, in
getting away, caught his heel and fell.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock went to Harry almost in his
own corner, and, after one or two feints
some sharp exchanges took place, each getting
it on the chin. Paddock slipped on his
knees, and while in that position Harry gave
him a severe crack on the smeller, drawing
a tidy supply of the small still. (A claim of
“foul” was once more made, which was
overruled by the referee, who considered
that Broome’s hand had started on its journey
before Tom reached the ground.)</p>

<p>     38.&mdash;&#8203;Tom came up bleeding from his
sneezer, and dashed fiercely in; he planted
his left heavily on the throat, closed, and
fibbed his adversary with his left hand,
while he held him with his right; he then
neatly changed him over into the other arm,
and gave him a dose with his right daddle on
the nose and mouth, and Harry was eventually
down, the main being on at the high
service from both taps. Harry now laid himself
on his stomach, in the hope of easing
his distressed bellows, and was very slow to
time; and no wonder either, seeing the
quickness with which they had fought.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;Tom dashed in, when Harry instantly
closed, but Tom gave him no peace; he pegged
away with both hands, administering
heavy pepper on the ribs without a return;
he then nailed poor Harry on the proboscis
and mouth very heavily, and Harry fell.
(Cries of “take him away,” but Harry would
not hear of it.)</p>

<p>     40.&mdash;&#8203;Tom came up smiling, and scarcely
marked; he at once went to work, and followed
Broome all over the ring, giving him
no breathing time. He got a little one on
the nose without a return, and Broome got
down, blowing like a grampus. (51 minutes
had now elapsed.)</p>

<p>     41.&mdash;&#8203;Harry made a feint, but it was long
out of distance, and Paddock quickly returned
on the left optic. Broome now put
in a little one on the mouth; after some
merry little exchanges, they closed. At infighting
Paddock got it heavily on the throat,
and in the end he slipped down.</p>

<p>     42.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock let fly his left, but was short,
when Broome returned open-handed on the
nose, and immediately closed. Paddock
fibbed him heavily and effectually, prevented
his obtaining any hold, and in the end, after
Paddock had received a rattler from the left
on the side of his nut, he slipped down.</p>

<p>     43.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, bent on finishing his job offhand,
dashed in, got heavily on Harry’s ribs
with his left, and Broome fell.</p>

<p>     44.&mdash;&#8203;Tom once more dashed in, let go his
left on the beak, and on getting to close
quarters some heavy fibbing ensued, and
another struggle for the fall, which neither
got, and they fell together.</p>

<p>     45.&mdash;&#8203;Tom went at his man with determination,
delivered his left on the side of the
nut, when Broome closed, but Tom proving
much the stronger man, Harry got down.</p>

<p>     46.&mdash;&#8203;Harry attempted a rush, but it was
only an attempt. Tom came to meet him,
delivered his one, two, with quickness on
the front of the dial, and Harry fell, again
lying on his back in the hope of recovering
his wind.</p>

<p>     47.&mdash;&#8203;Tom dodged his adversary, and then
popped in a rib-bender with his right; Harry
missed his return, and Paddock then made
another visitation on Harry’s temple, and the
latter fell.</p>

<p>     48.&mdash;&#8203;The left side of Harry’s nut was terribly
swollen, and his left peeper all but
closed, while Paddock had still two good
eyes, and was as strong and active as ever.
Harry was extremely weak, and it was perceptible
to all that nothing but an accident
could give him a chance. He came up boldly,
<a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a><span class="pageno">302</span>
however, and stopped Tom’s first lead. A
second time he was not so successful, and
received a smasher on the whistler and fell.</p>

<p>     49.&mdash;&#8203;Tom led off, but Harry cross-countered
him on the proboscis rather heavily,
Harry then closed, but was fibbed very
severely on the left ear until he fell. (One
hour had now elapsed.)</p>

<p>     50.&mdash;&#8203;Harry came up bleeding from his left
ear, nose, and mouth. Tom rattled in, dashed
a heavy hit with his left on the nose, and then
his right on the mouth. Harry seemed to
wake up a little at this, and some heavy jobbing
hits were exchanged, but in the end
Harry fell, extremely weak. His brother
(Fred) wished him to give in, but he seemed
bent on another round.</p>

<p>     51 and last.&mdash;&#8203;Harry, very slow to the call
of time, came up unsteady and tottering; he
made a blow at Paddock, but missed, and
Tom let fly a vicious right-hander at the side
of his nut&mdash;&#8203;it missed its destination and
alighted on Harry’s chest, where it left a
tremendous bruise. It was a settler, however;
it floored the gallant Harry, who, on
time being called, got up, but instantly sank
exhausted on his second’s knee, and Tass
Parker, seeing that it was all over, threw up
the sponge, Paddock being proclaimed the
winner, after a bustling affair of <em>one hour
and three minutes</em>. An attempt was made
by some few outsiders to bring the affair to
a wrangle. They declared the sponge had
not been thrown up by Tass Parker, and that
Paddock, who had left the ring immediately
after that act, had forfeited by so doing
before a decision had been come to. This
attempt was, of course, scouted by all the
respectable spectators, and was especially
discountenanced by Harry Broome himself,
who owned that he had been fairly
vanquished, and that Tom Paddock was now
at any rate a better man than himself. The
proceedings over, the company at once betook
themselves to a station, about a mile
distant, whither the special had been
removed, and whither they were followed by
Tom Paddock, who, with the exception of a
few very trifling bruises, appeared unscathed.
Harry Broome was too much exhausted to
walk the distance, and, therefore, in company
with Nat Langham, Jem Burn, and a
few others, awaited the arrival of the train
at the field of battle. These invalids were
quickly embarked, and nothing now prevented
the expedition from returning with
all speed to the Metropolis. The word was
therefore given, and good way being made,
Shoreditch was gained by half-past six.
Here the excitement was infinitely greater
than it had been in the morning, and there
was a general rush of the crowd to ascertain
the result of the tournay. The news of the
easy victory of Tom Paddock was received
with universal astonishment; and though
the general feeling appeared to be one of
pleasure, still, even the largest winners could
not help expressing their pity for the downfall
of Harry Broome. Harry arrived at home
about seven, and was at once put to bed. He
did not appear to suffer so much from bodily
pain as from mental affliction. His defeat
was as unexpected as it was easy, and, of
course, convinced Broome that his day had
gone by for figuring in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> Tom Paddock
proceeded in triumph to the house of
his kind friend, Alec Keene, “Three Tuns,”
Moor Street, Soho, where he was received
with enthusiasm, and where he remained
until far into the small hours, receiving the
hearty congratulations of his backers and
friends.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Our readers, doubtless, have,
ere this, drawn their own conclusions as
to the conduct and issue of this eventful
battle, and it is at the risk of being
thought tedious that we venture to offer our
own comments thereupon. Harry Broome
is no longer the man he was, and this remark
applies not merely to his inability to
train, but also to his falling off in that
quickness and judgment for which heretofore
he had distinguished himself. He
admits that he cannot train, that he feels
his own weakness, and that on Monday all
his fighting qualities appeared to have left
him directly he held up his hands. It certainly
did seem extraordinary to see a well-known
good general at the very outset rattle
in and lead off at the body, throwing open
his head to the attack of his adversary; and
when it was seen afterwards that he could
neither stop nor hit with anything like
vigour, there was a general exclamation of
astonishment. Some persons said he did
not intend fighting; but any one with half
an eye could see that this was not the case,
and that all his mistakes were the result of
physical incapability. Even his wrestling
powers appeared to have left him; but then,
it must be remembered that the way in
which all his attempts for the fall were
met by Paddock, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, by fibbing at his
nut until he loosed his hold, was well calculated
to distract even a more powerful man.
The only thing that reminded us of the
Harry Broome of old appeared to be the
gift of occasionally delivering a straight
hit with his left; but even this power was
taken from him by the accident to that hand
early in the fight, which entirely deprived
him of its use, as might be seen by his continually
hitting open-handed. The want of
vigour in his right hand was sufficiently obvious
from the almost entire immunity from
punishment of the winner. Harry still resorted
occasionally to his old trick of turning
round and running from his opponent&mdash;&#8203;a
plan of fighting which, in our opinion, is
neither commendable as a method of escaping
punishment, or judicious as a means of
drawing an adversary off his guard. Of
game and determination Harry displayed no
lack, and it was not until perfectly exhausted
<a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a><span class="pageno">303</span>
and incapable of renewing hostilities
that he consented to be taken away.
Of Tom Paddock we do not feel that we are
called upon to say much, but the little we do
must be all in the highest terms. At first he
was evidently cautious, and a little thrown off
his guard by the extraordinary tactics of
Broome, thinking, as he did, that the latter
was merely “kidding him,” in order to induce
him to throw away a chance. Tom
however, was steady, and bided his time.
He was now and then a little wild, and lost
his precision; but this cannot be wondered
at, seeing the pace at which they fought&mdash;&#8203;not
one round lasting above a minute. He
took what little punishment he received, as
he always does, without a murmur; and we
must do him the justice to say, that he
fought throughout with great good temper.
In point of science and coolness, we consider
that he has improved every time we have seen
him enter the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, and on this, his last appearance,
his advance in the noble art was
more than ever perceptible. He hit straight
and heavily with each hand. When at close
quarters, he fought as one possessing a clear
head, and a just appreciation of what was
best to be done, and occasionally displayed
a presence of mind which was most astonishing,
being quite unexpected from his reputed
“hasty” character. The performance
of changing Broome over from one hand to
the other, and giving him a dose from each
pepper-box, described above, was one of the
best instances of this presence of mind. Tom
is now within one of the goal of his wishes,
and we doubt not will find plenty of friends
to back him against the veteran Tipton
Slasher, who, although he vanquished our
hero five or six years ago, will, in the event
of their again meeting, find that he has cut
out for himself a task the satisfactory completion
of which will be easier imagined than
completed. Tom has now the ball at his
foot; every one wishes him well, and by
steadiness and good conduct he has every
chance of obtaining a position which will
render him comfortable for the remainder of
his days. We cannot conclude these remarks
without paying a compliment to the seconds
for the careful manner in which they nursed
their men. Alec Keene’s excellent judgment
no doubt proved of considerable utility to
Tom Paddock, and the herculean strength
of the “stunted Lifeguardsman,” as he bore
his charge in his single arms to his corner,
elicited the applause, and, we may say, the
astonishment, of the surrounding throng.
Tom Sayers and Tass Parker did their duty
most ably by Harry Broome, and by their
careful nursing enabled him to prolong the
encounter quite as long as was consistent with
humanity or prudence.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>The battle money, £400, was paid over to Paddock, at Alec Keene’s,
on the Friday of the following week. After some deserved complimentary
remarks on the conduct of the winner, the Stakeholder expressed his condolence
with the defeated man, to which Paddock immediately responded,
amidst some applause, by placing a £10 note in our hands towards the
collection already made for the losing man; to this two gentlemen present
added the like amount, and the collection for the losing man was announced
to be £62 14s., a sum subsequently increased. Broome, in a neat speech,
expressed his grateful sense of the support he had met with from friends,
and the kindness of those who had opposed him. He further declared his
intention to “stick to business,” and never again tempt fortune in the Prize
Ring, for which he felt his day was past. The evening thereafter passed
in harmony and good fellowship.</p>

<p>The Tipton Slasher, whose match with Aaron Jones had gone off in
the interval preceding the event just narrated, now came again to the front,
and, Harry Broome having retired from the “the tented field,” made proposals
to Paddock. Tom was now certainly another man from the time when he
was knocking about two or three years previously. Meeting on Worcester
Race-course, at the July races, Paddock being now in a sort of partnership
<a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a><span class="pageno">304</span>
with his late opponent, Harry Broome, as booth-keepers and purveyors,
the “Old Tipton” being also in the same line, the “two-of-a-trade”
proverb was verified, and a couple of “fivers” were popped down for the
old opponents to face each other for £200 a side, and meet at Alec Keene’s
in the next week, and settle particulars. Great was the muster on Tuesday,
July 15th, at the “Three Tuns,” when the articles were drawn, and another
£20, in addition to the first £10, provisionally placed in the hands of Alec,
and the remainder of the deposits dated and settled. Not a little surprise,
however, was occasioned by the fact that Harry Broome appeared as the
backer, friend, and adviser of the Slasher, and declared himself responsible
for his training expenses, colours, &amp;c.; the date fixed being November 15th.
At the second deposit, however, which was appointed for the succeeding
Tuesday, at the Slasher’s own house, “The Champion” Inn, Spon Lane,
Tipton, “a scare” was occasioned; neither Paddock nor any representative
was present, and the Tipton claimed forfeit. Inquiry proved that the
seldom-failing post office was the innocent cause of the non-delivery; Paddock’s
£10 having been duly forwarded from Brighton two days before, but
returned to the post office, marked “Address not known;” “Spon Lane,”
being written thereon, but the important word “Tipton” accidentally
omitted. All which was explained, and the envelope produced, at the next
deposit, at Jem Burn’s, “Rising Sun,” in Air Street. From this time things
went on regularly until £80 were down, when, to the general disappointment
of all parties, Tom presented himself at the appointed place&mdash;&#8203;Jem
Ward’s “Champion Stores,” Oxford Street&mdash;&#8203;and quietly stated that, owing
to “want of friends,” and his own losses “at racing,” he “must submit to
a forfeit.” Hereupon Broome declared that Slasher should fight for £50,
rather than there should be “no fight;” to which there was no response,
and the whole of the money was handed over in due time to the lucky Tipton
Slasher, at a “Champion’s” dinner, at “The Coal-hole,” presided over by
the facetious Chief Baron Nicholson. How this short-lived Championship
was “done for,” in 10 rounds, by little Tom Sayers, on the 16th of June,
1857, at the Isle of Grain, must be read in the Life of <span class="sc">Tom Sayers</span>, hereafter.</p>

<p>In the month of February in the following year, after Sayers’ second
defeat of the unlucky Aaron Jones, we could not help remarking that the
little Champion had mentioned to us privately, though certainly not under
the seal of secrecy, that he thought his next venture would be either Tom
Paddock or the Tipton. It proved to be the latter. Tom, chafing at the
<a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><span class="pageno">305</span>
delay, called on the Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, on the 17th of June, the day
after the battle between Sayers and “The Tipton,” and on the 21st we
read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<span class="sc">Tom Paddock again in the Field.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Paddock is by no means
satisfied that Tom Sayers should wear the Champion’s belt undisputed.
He has, therefore, called upon us to state that he can be backed against
Sayers for any sum from £100 up to £500. To fight within five or six
months at Sayers’ option. He will be at Alec Keene’s, Moor Street, Soho,
on Wednesday next.”</p>

<p>A comical episode intervened. “Big Ben” actually left £10 with “the
Editor” to make a match with Sayers, who, thereupon, promptly covered
it, informing Paddock that if his “engagement” with Ben went off he
should have the preference. The “little game” of the Big One was next
week displayed most transparently. Caunt declared it “to be understood
that the articles were to be drawn up, and further deposits made, at <em>his</em>
house;” and “he should expect Sayers to attend there,” <abbr title="et cetera, et cetera">&amp;c., &amp;c.</abbr>; adding,
that “of course the date must be beyond my affair with Langham,”
(nearly two months later!) Tom was not “drawn” by or to the “Coach
and Horses,” and the negotiations were suspended. In the same paper we
find the subjoined letter from Alec Keene, relating to Sayers’ reply to
Paddock:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="flushright">“Three Tuns, Moor Street, Soho, July 9, 1857.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Mr. Editor</span>,&mdash;&#8203;I have very strictly observed the results of Tom Sayers’ recent career,
and certainly did expect (taking into consideration the many warm interviews between Sayers
and Paddock on former occasions), that the first-named gentleman would have been only too
glad to accommodate Paddock with a ‘merry meeting.’ I cannot understand why Sayers
does not accept Paddock’s offer, for should Sayers be permitted, there is just a possibility of
abortive matches being continually made, forfeits taken, ultimately the prescribed time for
legitimate possession or the belt elapse, and then Sayers becomes its lawful possessor. Let
it be distinctly understood, sir, that I do not say such <em>will</em> be the case; but matches like
Caunt’s (that personage being preoccupied with Langham) must necessarily occupy needless
time; and gentlemen connected with the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> have lately become so learned that it behoves
me (as Paddock’s deputy) to regard every move in the camp of the enemy with jealous
watchfulness. I see no other person really capable to fight Paddock, therefore it will be
useless for the opposite party to dissemble; <em>we must meet</em>, and I hope Sayers will think with
me, that the sooner we conclude terms the more satisfactory to the public, as it is but just
that Tom should be accepted after being so long ‘an expectant.’ I nearly omitted to mention
that Sayers never meets Paddock without distributing a quantity of that chaff for
which he is famous. We do not want this, we wish business; and I conclude by earnestly
hoping your kind insertion of this will assist us.</p>

<p class="flushright">“Yours, &amp;c.,&emsp;&emsp;“ALEC KEENE.”</p>
</div><!--end letter-->

<p>There is, indeed, “many a slip ’twixt the cup and the lip.” The very
week in which Alec Keene penned his friendly note, Paddock was laid
prostrate by a severe attack of rheumatic fever, his state being declared
<a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a><span class="pageno">306</span>
dangerous when admitted to the Westminster Hospital, on the recommendation
of the medical man called in.</p>

<p>And here we must interpose what a parsonic biographer would call a
“refreshing” incident, showing that there is that “touch of nature which
makes the whole world kin” even in the hearts of “those degraded
wretches who engage in brutal prize-fights” (as we heard a very Reverend
Dean, the Vicar of Cheltenham, charitably characterise this very
pugilist and his <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confrères</span>). Tom Sayers called in Norfolk Street, in
the next week, to accept Paddock’s challenge and cover his deposit,
when he was informed of his namesake’s illness. He was himself that
very day going North, and he not only expressed his earnest sympathy
with his adversary’s affliction, but at once left £5 for his use, with a promise
to use his best endeavours to collect a fund among his friends for the
same purpose; and he did so. We find no such practical Christian charity
among the “refreshing” passages in “the Memoirs” of the vice-suppressing
clergyman.</p>

<p>In the October following, Paddock, recovering from his long and painful
illness, looked up his friends, and wrote from Brighton (inclosing £10) to
say that he was “ready to meet the winner of the fight between Tom
Sayers and Bill Benjamin for £200 a side; to come off within four months
after the 5th January, 1858,” the fixture for that fight.</p>

<p>The disposal, by the “coming man,” in 1856, of Harry Poulson, in
February, 1857, of Aaron Jones, of the Tipton Slasher in June of the same
year, and of Bill Benjamin (Bainge), in January, 1856, seemed to have failed
to convince “the knowing ones” of even the probability of a 10½ stone
beating 12 or 13 stone; so the anti-Sayerites readily backed Paddock to
do battle with the “little” champion. Sayers, on hearing that Paddock
had a difficulty (he had quarrelled with Alec Keene, his money-finder) in
raising the £200 required, showed his accommodating temper by lowering
the stake to £150, thus making the total £300 instead of £400. The
15th of June, 1858, was appointed for the battle.</p>

<p>The public interest was intense, and the crowd at London Bridge station
on the eventful morning was immense. Paddock never looked better; he
was red as a beetroot, and as strong and healthy as if he never had witnessed
the sight of “turning off the gas.” He was credited, on the authority
of his trainer, with doing fifty miles of walking a day at one period of
his training, and weighed exactly 12 stone, at which he was supposed to be
at his best. How all these qualifications, backed by perfect confidence
<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a><span class="pageno">307</span>
unflinching game, and desperate courage, failed in the trial, and he struck
his flag to the victorious “Champion,” who, on this day, proved himself
the stronger though the lighter man, will be found in the first chapter of
the next “Period” of our History.</p>

<p>Once more, and for the last time, our hero appeared in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> This
was in combat with the gigantic Sam Hurst, who, in 1860, put forth a
claim to the Championship. Hurst, who weighed 15<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, and stood 6<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> 2½<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr>,
was renowned as a wrestler. Hurst, of whom the reader may know more
by a reference to the Memoir of <span class="sc">Jem Mace</span>, in a future chapter of the
present volume, was, of course, formidable from his strength, weight, and
bulk; his boxing pretensions were of a mediocre quality. Paddock lost
the battle by a chance blow from the Colossus, in the fifth round, at the
end of nine and a half minutes; and thus closed an active, chequered, but
not inglorious Ring career as a defeated man.</p>

<p>From this time Paddock no further occupied a position of prominence in
pugilistic circles. He had but few of the qualifications necessary to
impart the principles or demonstrate the practice of boxing to learners, and
except an occasional appearance with the gloves, he was unheard of by the
public, until his demise, from a somewhat lingering illness, on the 30th
June, 1863.

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="h4head">HARRY BROOME (CHAMPION).<br />
1843&ndash;1856.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Harry Broome</span>, a younger brother of the renowned Johnny, was born
in the “hardware town,” which has given so many of its best pugilists to
the modern Ring, that Birmingham early rivalled, and afterwards eclipsed,
the fame of Bristol as the birthplace of boxers. The subject of this memoir,
who first saw the light in 1826, was a mere boy at the time when his elder
brother had fought his way to “the topmost round of fortune’s ladder”&mdash;&#8203;Broome’s
ultimate victory, that over Bungaree, the Australian, being
achieved in April, 1842, when Harry had not yet counted sixteen summers.
At that time Johnny had already married, and settled as host of a well-accustomed
tavern&mdash;&#8203;to wit, “The Rising Sun,” in Air Street, Piccadilly,
where his shrewdness, activity, and enterprise had transformed the short
avenue from Piccadilly to Regent Street into a “high change” of sporting;
a very Rialto of the Ring, where patrons and practitioners of the Noble Art
“most did congregate.” The sparring saloon at “The Rising Sun,” at this
period, was the arena for the display of the best fistic talent of the Metropolis;
and here, at the age of sixteen, we first saw the aspiring youngster&mdash;&#8203;a lithe,
smooth-skinned, active stripling, very boyish in look, standing 5 feet 8
inches, and weighing 9 st. 7 lbs.&mdash;&#8203;put on the mittens, and make a most
creditable “private trial” with the well-known Byng Stocks, of Westminster.
Stocks, despite his 11 stone and experience, by no means had the
best of the mimic mill, though once or twice urged by the delighted
“Johnny” “Not to spare the young ’un because he was his brother.” This
promising <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</span> was followed by several favourable public displays; and
within a few months not a few of the best judges were of opinion that,
barring all question of breed and blood, a new and formidable aspirant for
the middle-weight Championship would be found in Young Broome,
when a year or two should have hardened the gristle into bone, and manhood
<a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a><span class="pageno">309</span>
had consolidated the muscle and set the frame of the future gladiator.
And so some months rolled on; a glove-fight, in which Harry disposed of
Mitchell, a 10-stone outsider, for a £5 note, being a mere <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’essai</span>, got
up by a few aristocratic visitors of “The Rising Sun,” of which Harry
was the rising star.</p>

</div>

<p>As we have already said, Johnny Broome at this time filled a large
space in the eye of the sporting world, and young Harry, emulous of the
fistic fame of his elder brother, with a strong family instinct for fighting,
was most importunate with Johnny to let him try his “prentice han’” in
combat with some suitable antagonist. Johnny, however, did not choose
to lower the dignity of the name of Broome by allowing Harry to strip for
“a purse” with any novice; nor would he hear of a match with any
“commoner” or “outsider,” for a five, ten, or twenty-five pound stake.
He would back Harry for £50, or not at all.</p>

<p>At this time there was a strong jealousy, not to say envy, of the position
earned by Johnny in Ring affairs, and more than once did we hear a wish
expressed by East-enders and others, that “somebody” would “take the
shine out of these upstart Brums.” Accordingly, when it was made known,
in September, 1843, that “Young Harry” was ready for a “customer” for
£50, they put on their considering caps, and Fred Mason (the Bulldog),
standing idle in the market-place, was asked what he thought of the young
“ten-stunner?”</p>

<p>Mason, who had, among others, twice beaten Bill Jones, after desperate
battles, in which he earned his formidable nickname, received a sort of
certificate from Johnny Walker (by whom he had been beaten) that he
was just the man to achieve the desired object, if he could raise the half-hundred.
At a council held at “The Grapes,” in Aylesbury Street,
Clerkenwell, it was decided that the “needful” should be posted, and the
cartel accepted. The articles proposed Tuesday, the 10th of October
1843, but subsequently Broome objected to this, as on that day the
Cesarewitch would be run, at Newmarket, and several of Harry’s best
friends, who were anxious to see his “first appearance,” would be unable
to be present. It was accordingly postponed to Wednesday, the 11th.
By mutual agreement “The Nymph” steamer was engaged by the two
Johnnies (Broome and Walker) for the mutual advantage of the men, and
to disburse their training and other expenses. All went smoothly. “The
Nymph,” at the appointed hour of eight, got under weigh from Hungerford
Market, with a goodly freight of West-enders; then she took in a large
<a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a><span class="pageno">310</span>
company at Old Swan Stairs, London Bridge, while the “Sages of the
East” came on board at Brunswick Pier, Blackwall, in increased numbers.
Thence she steamed down stream with pleasant speed (with the unwelcome
convoy of a trio of crowded tugs), until she came to Long Reach, where,
between Dartford and Northfleet, in a meadow distant from all human
habitation, it was determined to land. This operation was performed
amidst an aqueous downpour, which drenched all the row-boats and their
occupants, except those who were clad in waterproof garments. The
Commissary lost no time in forming the lists, immediately within the sea
wall, upon an excellent piece of turf, and, despite the rattling shower,
which increased rather than diminished, accomplished his task in a
workmanlike manner. The stools and benches of the steamer were, as
usual, transferred to the shore for the accommodation of the “Corinthians,”
of whom there were many present, and a most acceptable save-all they
proved; nevertheless the great majority had to grin the storm out of countenance;
and amidst a perfect deluge, at twelve o’clock the combatants and
their seconds made their <em>salaams</em>&mdash;&#8203;the Bulldog under the care of Jem
Turner and Jemmy Shaw; Broome waited upon by Levi Eckersley and
Tom Maley.</p>

<p>Little time was lost in encircling the stakes with their fogles&mdash;&#8203;white and
blue spot for the Bulldog, and blue and white spot for Broome. Both
were as cheerful as if pirouetting in the Lowther Rooms. Happily, before
business commenced the storm somewhat abated, and the weather became
comparatively fine, although occasional slantindicular visitations from the
upper regions proved that the only thing settled was the unsettled state of
the weather. Young Harry’s “first appearance” was prepossessing. He
entered the ring, after dropping in his cap, with a modest bow, and a smile
or nod of recognition to several acquaintances, and at once steadily proceeded
to divest himself of his upper clothing. “He is a fine young
fellow,” says a contemporary report, “only eighteen years of age, standing
5 feet 9 inches, and weighing 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 2<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> (he was limited by virtue of
the articles to 9<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 3<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>), and evidently in first-rate condition, not an ounce
of superfluous flesh being visible, and his form as active, alert, and springy
as a greyhound.” Of his milling qualifications of course no one had as
yet any opportunity of judging, so that he was scanned with all the
curiosity with which men examine a “dark horse.” The “Bulldog” also
looked in robust health, but he struck us as being too fleshy; and, added
to this, it could not but be felt that he was rather stale, not only from the
<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a><span class="pageno">311</span>
free life he had led, but from his repeated battles, in which he sustained no
small quantum of punishment, and especially in his fight with Johnny
Walker, who, however, expressed the greatest confidence in his powers.
His weight, we should say, was at least 9<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, and in length he was
full two inches shorter than Broome. His rushing and fearless character
of fighting gained for him the sobriquet of “Bulldog,” and his courage
further entitled him to this canine distinction.</p>

<p>The officials being nominated, offers were made to take 7 to 4, 6 to 4, and
ultimately 5 to 4; but the Broomites were cautious, although, taking
youth, length, and weight into consideration, he was certainly entitled to
be backed at odds. Doubts as to his qualities were, however, still to be
satisfied, and the speculators were shy of investing.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Precisely at twelve minutes to
twelve the men were delivered at the scratch,
neither displaying the slightest nervousness,
and both looking jolly and determined on
mischief. No time was lost; Broome led off
with his left, but the Bulldog stopped and
got away quickly. Bulldog now advanced
to the charge left and right, and got home
on Broome’s nose and left eyebrow. Broome,
not idle, returned prettily, when the Bull
rushed in, closed, and, after slight fibbing,
finding Broome too strong, got down, amidst
the vociferous cheers of his friends.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, nothing daunted, was quick
to the scratch, and led off left and right, the
Bulldog hitting with him; a sharp rally, and
heavy hits exchanged, in which Broome had it
on the smeller, and his cork was drawn. (First
blood for “Bully.”) A close at the ropes,
in which Broome tried for the fall, but Mason
held his legs too wide apart, and the crook
could not be got. Broome forced him on
the ropes, and there held him as if in a vice&mdash;&#8203;his
own nose dropping the crimson fluid.
Bully struggled to get loose, but Broome
grappled him closer. Mutual attempts at
fibbing&mdash;&#8203;when, after an ineffectual trial
on the part of Broome for the fall, Mason
got down besmeared with his opponent’s
claret, and pinked on his left cheek. Broome
showed a slight cut on the left eyebrow as
well as the tap on the snout.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Broome opened the ball without hesitation,
and caught Bully on the mouth,
lifting the bark from his nether lip. A short
pause, when Broome again went to work
left and right, but Mason got away; Mason
hit out of distance. A rally, in which Broome
followed his man to the ropes, hitting left
and right; while at the ropes Broome let go
his right, and catching Bully on the temple
he dropped, but looked up smiling.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Broome popped in his left slightly on
Bully’s cheek; tried it again, but the blow
passed over his shoulder. Mason rushed in
left and right, closed, and tried to fib;
Broome, however, proved the stronger man,
grappled him against the stake, and, after
some in-fighting, in which Mason got a crack
over the larboard cheek, he contrived to pull
Broome down.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Mason displayed a mouse under each
eye, and came slow to the scratch. Broome
hit short with the left, and Bully did ditto.
Exchanges left and right, and a close at the
ropes. Broome hung on the neck of Mason,
which lay across the ropes, but was unable
to get the look for the fall; at last both
were down, Broome having had the best of
the round.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, as lively as a kitten, let fly
his left, and caught Bully on the mug, repeating
a smack on the body with the same
hand. Mason tried his right, only tapping
Broome’s shoulder. Counter-hits with the
left, both napping it on the muzzle. A short
rally, followed by a close, in which Broome
slipped down.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Broome tried his left and right, but
was stopped; he was not, however to be denied;
he again rattled in in the same style,
nailed Mason with both hands, and gave him
the upper-cut with the right. Heavy exchanges,
Mason fighting rather wild. In the
close Bully down, having all the worst of the
milling.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Broome led off quickly with his left,
and nailed his man on the cheek. A pause
for wind, when Broome again commenced
operations. Heavy counter-hitting left and
right, and a spirited rally, in which the exchanges
were severe. Broome closed for the
fall, but Mason dropped on his knees.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Hits left and right attempted, but
both short. Bully’s left neatly stopped,
when Broome delivered a rattler with his
<a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a><span class="pageno">312</span>
right on the body, and on the cheek with his
left. Good counter-hitting with the left; a
close at the ropes, and Mason caught Broome
round the neck over the ropes, but the latter
slipped down.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Mason, short with his left, retreated,
and sparred for wind. Slow fighting on
both sides. They at length got to work left
and right, and heavy muggers were exchanged.
A close for the throw, but Mason got down,
Broome on him.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;The Young’un popped in his left prettily
on Bully’s muzzle. Mason fought wildly
and hit short. Broome rushed to him and
closed, but Bully was not to be had at that
game, and fell.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Good outfighting on both sides, left
and right, and heavy exchanges. Broome
popped in his right heavily, and as Mason
was staggering hit him beautifully down
with his right. In the counter-hits Broome
had received a nasty crack on his smeller,
which bled profusely. (First knock-down
for Broome.)</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Harry, as usual, led off left and right;
Mason rushed to a close, and they reached
the ropes, where Broome, with his arm round
Mason’s neck, hung on him, till at last Mason
got back and fell, Broome over him.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Broome popped in left and right in
splendid style, repeating the dose with the
left on the head, and the right on the body.
Mason closed, but, finding Broome too
strong for him, dropped on one knee with
both hands up. Broome, although entitled
to hit, left him. (Applause.)</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Broome again led off with his left.
Mason short and wild in his returns. Broome
steady, and again delivered his left, drawing
additional claret. A close at the ropes;
more squeezing on the part of Broome, and
Mason got down, apparently fagged.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;The Bulldog slow to the scratch;
counter-hitting with the left, ditto with the
right. In the close Mason down again on
one knee, but Broome once more retired
without taking advantage of the opportunity
offered.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;A good weaving rally, in which the
hitting was tremendous, and, after mutual
compliments, in the close Mason dropped on
his knees. (Mason’s seconds now called for
brandy.)</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Mason slow in going to the scratch.
Broome rattled to him left and right, catching
him a severe nozzler. Bully made a
desperate rush, and heavy counter-hits were
exchanged. A lively rally followed, in which
mutual compliments were paid, and the
dripping claret proved that both had been
heavily hit. In the close, after a severe
struggle on the part of Broome to obtain
the fall, Mason dropped on one knee, and
Broome walked away, exhibiting heavy
marks of punishment. Mason was likewise
severely mauled, and his left eye was fast
closing.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Each regarded the other with mutual
good will. Broome bleeding at the mouth
and nose, but still steady and self-possessed.
He led off with the left, but was prettily
stopped. Counter-hits on each side missed,
when Broome closed, caught Mason round
the neck, and hung on him at the ropes till
he got down, amidst loud shouts of disapprobation
from Bully’s friends.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Broome led off with his left, and
again nailed Mason on the left eye. Mason
closed, when the Young’un suddenly disentangled
himself, stepped back, gave Mason
the upper cut with his right, followed by a
neat slap with his left, when Master Fred
slipped down.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Broome led off left and right; closed,
again caught Mason round the neck, hanging
upon him across the ropes until he fell.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Mason somewhat slow to the scratch,
across which Broome stepped, and led off
left and right. Bully let fly wildly left and
right, when Broome once more closed, flung
him across the ropes, and squeezed him as
if his neck were in a vice, amidst repeated
shouts of disapprobation. Jack Sheppard,
urged by the impatience of some of Mason’s
friends, ran with a knife to cut the ropes,
but luckily his man slipped down, and thereby
prevented an act which would have been
highly imprudent, inasmuch as the ring
would have thereby been destroyed; and
however unseemly such a style of fighting
might appear, it was not inconsistent with
any fixed rule of the Ring.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Broome delivered a heavy hit with his
left on Mason’s body; Mason short in the
return, and, after some wild exchanges, Bully
dropped on his knees.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Counter-hitting with the left; a
close, and, after some slight fibbing, Mason
again dropped on his knees.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Mason stopped Broome’s left, rushed
to in-fighting left and right, then, missing
his upper cut, got down.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Mason’s left eye all but gone, and
Broome’s mug showing sundry marks of
severe deliveries. A desperate rally, both
having made up their minds to mischief.
Heavy exchanges left and right, followed by
a close at the ropes, at which Mason once
more dropped on one knee, but Broome still
refrained from hitting.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Counter-hits with the left, Broome
catching it heavily on the nose. A slashing
rally, in which heavy right-handed hits were
exchanged till Mason fell on his knees, both
bleeding profusely.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Both men cautious. Broome in with
his left, and Mason short in his return.
Heavy counter-hitting. Bully receiving a
finishing smack from the right on his left
eye, which was completely closed. Broome
grappled for the fall, seized Mason by the
neck, and hung upon him until he brought
him down upon his nose.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;Counter-hits with the left, followed
by a close, in which Mason attempted to
get down, but Broome held him by the neck
<a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a><span class="pageno">313</span>
under his arm, and tried to lift him from the
ropes, until he fell, amidst shouts of disapprobation.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;Mason led off short, when Broome
steadied himself and popped in a terrific hit
with his left on the cheek. Counter-hits
left and right followed, Mason fighting
wildly. In the close Broome again hung on
his man till he extricated himself from his
painful position, and in getting away
Broome fell heavily upon him.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Mason getting slower. Counter-hitting
with the left and exchanges with the
right, in which Bully delivered heavily. In
the close Mason dropped on his knees.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;A rattling exchange of hits; a close
at the ropes, and Mason got down, amidst
the cheers of his friends. Broome rather
groggy from the heavy deliveries in the last
round, and the brandy-bottle on his side in
requisition.</p>

<p>     33 and 34.&mdash;&#8203;Short and merry rallies, in
both of which compliments were exchanged,
and Mason got down on his knees.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;Broome delivered two heavy lunging
hits with his left at the body; a rally and
heavy exchanges, when Broome caught his
man in the corner and again grappled him
round the neck with his arm as if in the
folds of a boa constrictor. Here he held him
for a considerable time, till Mason got each
leg in succession over the ropes, and
snatched his pimple out of chancery, as he
rose making a desperate upper cut with his
right, which he luckily missed, for had he
struck his man when outside of the ropes,
he would have lost the fight on the ground
of foul play.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, although fatigued, came up
with unshrinking spirit. Heavy counter-hits
with the left, when Mason overreached
himself, missed, and fell.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;Mason evidently less confident. He
was slow to the call of time, while Broome
rushed to his work, hit out left and right,
bored his man to the ropes, and again
clasped him in his vice till he fell.</p>

<p>     38.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, apparently regaining fresh
energy, the moment time was called rushed
to his man, led off left and right, closed at
the ropes, and, after some in-fighting, Mason
got down, Broome falling over him, evidently
with the intention of avoiding falling
on him.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, becoming still gayer, got to
work without delay, popped in a stinger at
the body with his right, and after an exchange
of facers, closed at the ropes. Mason
struggled and fell back, Broome hitting with
his right, and falling on him. It was now
seen that Mason was satisfied, and after a
short consultation with his friends, he
declined proceeding with the contest, declaring
that he felt he had no chance, for he
could not get at his man, and his power of
hitting was exhausted. At this time his left
eye was completely bunged up, and his face,
mouth, and nose were seriously contused;
added to which he complained that both his
hands were injured. Under these circumstances
Johnny Walker saw it was in vain
to protract the combat, and gave in on the
part of Mason, who immediately stood up
and shook hands with his opponent, who was
proclaimed the conqueror, after fighting <em>one
hour and twenty-one minutes</em>, greatly to the
disappointment and vexation of many of
Mason’s friends, who considered that he was
still able to continue the mill, and probably
make a turn in his favour. None, however,
know so well where the shoe pinches as he
who wears it, and Mason was sufficiently
satisfied with the dressing he had received,
without adding to its severity. On quitting
the ring after being dressed, Broome was so
elated with his success, that he threw three
successive somersaults, thus proving that his
strength and activity, at least, were unimpaired,
although the disfigurement of his
“dial” afforded pretty strong evidence of
the severity of Mason’s hitting.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;The issue of this battle has
placed Young Harry in a very creditable
position, and proved him to possess the first
of the requisites for a professor of pugilism&mdash;&#8203;courage,
combined with perfect self-possession
and a fair share of science. He is quick
on his legs, and possesses the happy knack
of using both hands with vigour and effect.
He never once lost the control over his own
actions, and between the rounds nursed and
husbanded his strength with the cunning
and calmness of a veteran. He was always
first on his legs on the call of time, and
almost invariably led off with his left
with precision and success. It is clear that
he knows the use of his legs; and had not
Bully known how to foil his intentions he
would no doubt have shown him a quick way
to his mother earth. If there was any fault
to be found with his style of fighting, it was
in his repeated hanging on his man at the
ropes. It ought not to be forgotten, however,
that Mason in the closes endeavoured
to grapple him with no friendly intention,
and to resist this he had recourse to an expedient
which is anything but pleasant to
the spectators. There is no law, however,
against it, and he cannot, therefore, be blamed
for following an example afforded him, not
only by his own brother but by many men
of long experience in the Ring. Taking him
“all in all” his <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</span> has been highly creditable,
and we have no doubt, if not overmatched
or overworked, he will become an
ornament to the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> The Bulldog fought,
we think, even better than on former occasions
on which we have seen him engaged.
He used his left more handily than it has
been our good fortune to witness in his
former contests, and his counter-hitting with
that hand was extremely severe, while his
slogging right told with stunning effect on
young Harry’s mug. Of throwing he has
but little knowledge, although he possesses
sufficient tact to evade the exercise of that
<a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><span class="pageno">314</span>
talent on the part of his antagonist. Like
all old ones who have felt the sting of
repeated punishment, he could not resist the
influence of hard knocks; and the body and
the mind concurring in the opinion that
“enough was as good as a feast,” and deeming
discretion the better part of valour, he
left off while he yet possessed sufficient self-possession
to enjoy the satisfaction of knowing
that he might have been worse beaten
without being better off.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>All now sought the ark, there to obtain the “creature comforts” which
had hitherto been withheld. To the men every possible attention was paid,
and a liberal subscription was collected for the loser. The battle-money
was given up to Young Broome, at his brother’s house, in Air Street, Piccadilly,
on the Wednesday of the following week.</p>

<p>The “breed” of young Harry being thus satisfactorily proved, his more
experienced brother determined that he should turn gristle into bone
before he again “sported buff” in the 24-foot, and more than a twelve-month
elapsed ere he made an appearance within the ropes. This was
on December 10, 1845, when he was matched for £50 a side against Joe
Rowe, a well known East-ender, of 10½st., whose victory over Cullen, in
1844, had raised him to a high position among the middle weights.</p>

<p>Mixed up with this encounter was a contemptible and ridiculous feud,
provoked and maintained by certain East-enders, who, taking umbrage
at what they considered the upstart assumption of Johnny Broome, and also
prompted by bitter jealousy at his success with the better order of Ring
patrons, sought by fair or by foul means to disparage the name of Broome,
and to defeat the pretensions of his younger brother. We quote the contemporary
report:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The unfortunate issue of the meeting is to be attributed to the gross
irregularities and unjustifiable outrages of the parties assembled to witness
the affray, who, regardless of all attempts to preserve an outer or even an
inner ring, rushed close to the ropes and stakes, which were broken and
levelled with the ground, and were at length reduced to such a state by
the intrusion of the multitude that it was utterly impossible for the men
to continue their contest; and the referee having withdrawn, both retired
from a scene which, we regret to say, is but a repetition of similar misconduct
in all parts of the country. This species of misconduct has more to
do with the downfall of the Prize Ring than any other cause to which we
can refer. We shall endeavour to describe the proceedings of the day,
and must leave it to the members of the Ring itself who mean to preserve
their ‘order’ to adopt some plan hereafter by which similar evils may be
prevented.”</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that by the articles neither of the men was to
<a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a><span class="pageno">315</span>
exceed 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 5<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, and that they were to meet at Peter Crawley’s on the
Monday for the purpose of going to scale. At Peter’s they did meet, and
were each 1<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> within the stipulated figure, both looking remarkably well
and equally confident. Rowe returned to his training-quarters, at Mitchell’s
Green, about three miles from Greenhithe, Kent, and Harry Broome
remained in London, to be prepared for his embarkation in the morning.
The “Nymph,” Woolwich steamer, was patronised upon this occasion, as
upon many former expeditions of a similar sort, and received on board a
goodly muster of the friends of the men on Tuesday morning, at Hungerford,
London Bridge, and Blackwall. She was not, however, without her
opponents, and another large steamer named the “Nelson,” as well as the
“William Gunston” tug-boat, by the cheapness of their fares, succeeded
in obtaining a very extensive patronage from the “rough-and-ready” customers
both from the East and the West, but more especially from the
former, the great nursery of Rowe’s early pretensions.</p>

<p>Harry Broome embarked at Blackwall, and it was considerably after ten
o’clock before the “Nymph” led the way to the field of battle, tardily
followed by her two rivals, the “Nelson” having got aground under
London Bridge, to the infinite terror of her passengers, who began to apprehend
that they had invested their three “bobs” each without the chance
of obtaining a view of the mill for their money. Luckily, however, they
ultimately got off; and from the delay which took place in arranging the
preliminaries for the battle, they arrived in time not only to reach the
field, but to increase, and perhaps create, the confusion which subsequently
prevailed. The marshes below Greenhithe were selected for the encounter,
and here the Commissary executed his operations with his customary
despatch. By twenty minutes after one the lists were prepared, but upwards
of half an hour elapsed before the combatants made their appearance, and
by this time more than 1,000 persons had assembled, including not only
the crews of the flotilla, but a large accession from the inhabitants of the
surrounding district, who, from Rowe’s training in the neighbourhood, and
from the frequent visits of Peter Crawley and his friends, became fully
apprised of the treat which was in store: a species of foreknowledge which
likewise reached a magistrate in the neighbourhood, who, before the fight
was half over, arrived on the ground accompanied by some dozen policemen.
The impolicy of the men approaching the intended locality of their
fight previous to the mill is manifest, and the present instance confirmed
the justice of our remark. In this case, however, from the terrific
<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span class="pageno">316</span>
confusion which prevailed, neither magistrate nor policemen ventured to get
within the vortex, the chance of a broken head being infinitely more
apparent than the probability of a respectful reception. His beakship, consequently,
contented himself with directing his aides-de-camp to take down
the names of as many active members of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> as they could obtain.</p>

<p>We will now endeavour to describe, as well as the buffetings to which
we were exposed will permit, “the mill,” its progress, and final interruption.
Shortly before two o’clock Harry Broome and Rowe arrived at the
ring; the former accompanied by his brother, Jack Hannan, and Sam Simmonds;
the latter by Peter Crawley, Jem Turner, and Young Sambo.
The ground was hard and the weather cold, but the breeze was somewhat
tempered to the “shorn lambs,” and not quite so piercing as it had been
the day before. The prospect of the commencement of business produced a
great deal of bustle among the ring-keepers, who endeavoured to beat out
those who had not paid for the privilege of the posts of honour; but this was
found to be a task of no common difficulty; in fact, it was soon seen, from
the conduct of the majority, that they were not persons disposed to be
governed by the rules of courtesy or fair play. Among the betting fraternity
Harry Broome had become the favourite, and was backed at 6 to 4, at which
price he backed himself on board the boat on his passage down. As in the
match between Maley and Merryman, Tom Spring was again persuaded
to take upon him the office of referee&mdash;&#8203;a kindness which he had much
reason to regret, as the issue will show. All being in readiness, at the
given signal the men were stripped of their upper crusts, and amidst the
cheering exclamations of their respective partisans, shook hands and threw
themselves into attitude. Their colours were, blue bird’s-eye for Rowe,
and blue with a divided white spot, and the initials “H. B.” in the centre,
for Broome.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;We have already described the
condition of the men, and certainly on their
stripping there was nothing to induce us to
recall our judgment. Broome had a little
the advantage in height and length, but
whatever advantage he possessed in this respect
was counterbalanced by the superior
muscular development of his opponent.
Broome smiled cheerfully, while Rowe displayed
the steady phiz of “a sage from the
East.” After a few dodges by way of feelers,
Rowe tried his left twice in succession, but
was stopped. Harry then led off with his
left, catching Rowe slightly on the mouth.
This brought them to a sharp rally, in
which blows were exchanged. Broome
popped in his left at the body, immediately
closed, and succeeded in throwing his man.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;On coming up Broome rushed to his
man, put in a slight blow on his mouth with
the left, closed, and after a short struggle
both were down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Harry led off with his left, which got
home on Rowe’s whistler; slight exchanges
to a close, when both were again down. (On
Rowe reaching his corner, we fancied we
discovered a tinge of blood on his lips.)</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Rowe, on going to the scratch after
one or two feints, sent his left well home on
Broome’s conk from which the purple fluid
<a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a><span class="pageno">317</span>
instantly flowed in profusion. Rowe again
made his left, this time under Harry’s eye,
from which the claret also spurted. They
then rattled to a close, when some sharp in-fighting
took place, Broome catching Rowe
on the skull with his right, in a sort of round
hit, which evidently injured the thumb-joint,
as he shook it as a dog would his sore paw,
and they fell together.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;On leaving his second’s knee Broome
showed a slight mouse on his left eye, the
effect of Rowe’s visitation in the last round.
Both hit slightly together with the left, and
came immediately to a rally, when some
heavy exchanges left and right took place.
They closed, struggled for the fall, and at
length fell together, Broome under.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;The men instantly rushed to a close,
and Broome got his man to the ropes, where
they hung until they went down, Broome
again under.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Broome napped another crack on the
left eye; ditto repeated; a close, a breakaway,
hit for hit exchanged left and right,
Broome making both fists tell on Joe’s body.
They then closed, and both were down,
Broome under.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Broome jumped up with alacrity,
rushed to his man, and attempted to plant his
left, but was neatly stopped. This led to a
rally, in which heavy hits were exchanged,
Rowe catching it on the muzzle and Harry
on the old spot under his left eye. They then
closed, hung on the ropes, and both were
again down. (The confusion outside the
ring now became greater and greater. In
vain did Cullen, Alec Reed, Young Reed,
and others, use their sticks and whips on the
nobs of the “roughs” who were pressing forward;
they were not to be driven back. It
was with the greatest difficulty the stakes
and inner ring were preserved entire.)</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;After a few dodges, Broome put in his
left slightly on Joe’s body below the waistband.
A claim of “foul” was instantly raised
by Rowe’s partisans, who alleged that the
blow had fallen below the waist. On Spring
being appealed to he immediately decided
“fair,” and the fight proceeded. The men
went to work, counter-hits right and left
were exchanged to a close, and Rowe got
down.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Broome again home on Rowe’s ’tato-trap,
which increased in protuberance;
counter-hits with the left, Broome catching
it on the nose; body blows exchanged;
counters left and right on the dial&mdash;&#8203;a close,
in which both were down. Broome on being
picked up showed a cut over his left brow,
from which the claret was coursing down in
profusion.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Heavy exchanges; Broome again
caught a nasty one over his eye. He returned
the compliment on Joe’s mouth.
Body blows exchanged. A close, and both
down, Broome under. The punishment in
this round increased the flow of claret from
the wounds of both, but they took it coolly,
and came up smiling for the next round.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;This was a punishing round on the
part of Broome, who had no sooner risen
from his corner than he rushed to his man,
put in two or three body blows, and then
made his left and right on Rowe’s frontispiece.
The latter made some slight returns,
and Broome rushed in, caught Rowe in his
arms, and hung upon him at the ropes until
the latter went down&mdash;&#8203;a game he pursued
throughout the fight.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;The cheering and chaffing of the
East-enders were deafening, and it was
with difficulty the timekeepers made themselves
heard. On reaching the scratch heavy
counter-hits were exchanged left and right,
Broome again experiencing the effect of
Rowe’s left on his eye. They soon closed,
struggled for the fall, and went down together.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;This round was similar to the last.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Heavy in-fighting blows exchanged
left and right, both on the mug and on the
body, the hitting rather in favour of Broome.
In the close both down.</p>

<p>     16 and 17.&mdash;&#8203;In these rounds the men
rushed to in-fighting at once, and some
stinging hits were made by each on the sore
spots of the other. Broome’s left eye was
observed to be fast closing. In the closes
which terminated the rounds they fell
together.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Slight exchanges to a close, when
Rowe was down, Broome alongside of him.
Rowe’s mouth began to exhibit unmistakable
evidence of Harry’s power of hitting,
although, with the exception of the cuts on
his lip, there was nothing particular the
matter with his face. Indeed, the hitting
on both sides seemed to have been directed
almost entirely to particular spots&mdash;&#8203;<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>,
Broome on Joe’s mouth, and the latter on
Harry’s left eye and cheek.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Rowe made his left slightly on
Broome’s forehead. The latter then attempted
his left, but was prettily stopped.
In two other attempts he was more successful,
as he put in his left twice, first on Joe’s
mouth, and then on his smeller, from which,
as well as his mouth, the claret began to
exude. In the close Joe was down, Harry
on him.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;The combatants quickly rushed to a
close, and after a short struggle at the ropes,
both went down together. (The noise and
confusion were now becoming terrific. The
spectators in the rear made a rush, the
stake in Rowe’s corner was nearly forced
from the ground, several other stakes were
broken, and the bottom rope of the inner
ring was completely trodden under foot.
The pressure was so great in the corner
where we sat that we were obliged to enter
the inner ring, in order to be able to get a
note of what was going on. There seemed
among some of the lowest order of spectators
to be a strong party feeling against Johnny
Broome, for what cause it was impossible to
tell, but they repeatedly called upon him to
come in and fight himself, and charged him
<a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><span class="pageno">318</span>
with acting foully, although we saw nothing
of the kind in his conduct up to this, beyond
his assisting the seconds in wiping his
brother&mdash;&#8203;an example which Crawley followed
with Rowe.)</p>

<p>     21 and 22.&mdash;&#8203;Broome home with his left
on Joe’s nose and mouth several times.
Rowe’s returns were slight. In the latter
round, however, Rowe succeeded in the
close in forcing Broome over the ropes, and
falling on him.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Broome’s left again in collision with
Rowe’s mouth. Counter-hits with the left.
A close at the ropes, and Broome succeeded
in throwing his man.</p>

<p>     24 to 29.&mdash;&#8203;In these rounds the same style
of fighting was pursued, hitting left and
right being the order of the day. Very few
attempts were made at stopping, and these
few were on the part of Rowe, who parried
Harry’s left on several occasions. The rounds
ended with a close at the ropes, in which
Broome generally had the advantage, and
got his man down by hanging on him.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;Joe stopped a nasty one from Harry’s
left. Heavy hits were then exchanged on
the old spots, and both were down, Rowe
under. (The disorderly conduct of the
spectators got worse and worse. The ring-keepers
were obliged to get inside the ring,
and used their whips and sticks very freely;
but as fast as they drove the intruders back
from the ropes they again came forward, returning
hits for compliments paid them.)</p>

<p>     31 to 36.&mdash;&#8203;Heavy exchanges, and no
flinching or attempts to stop. Previous to
these rounds we thought Rowe was weak
and on the wane, but he now rallied, and
was firmer on his pins. He was, however,
generally forced to the ropes, where Broome
hung upon him until he fell.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;Broome received a stinger on his
snout, which renewed the rivulet of claret.
He returned slightly on Rowe’s cheek and
closed. Rowe was, after a short struggle,
forced down, Broome on him.</p>

<p>     38.&mdash;&#8203;Broome made his left again on Joe’s
mouth. He then retreated to his corner, as
if to get wind. Rowe was following, but
Harry rushed to him, repeated his dose on
the mouth, and fought to a close at the
ropes, where, after a somewhat lengthened
struggle, amidst great confusion in and out
of the ring (Johnny Broome holding the
rope), both got down together.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;Hitting right and left, and a close, in
which some slight fibbing took place, Broome
again receiving over his damaged eye, which
was now almost “used up.” At length, after
a break away, and a few harmless exchanges,
Rowe got down.</p>

<p>     40.&mdash;&#8203;Heavy counters with the left, Broome
receiving a snorter, which re-opened the
springs from which the by-no-means-limpid
stream had previously trickled. A close at
the ropes, Broome still pursuing his tactics
of endeavouring to hang upon his man.
Rowe at length got down, pulling Broome
along with him.</p>

<p>     41.&mdash;&#8203;Rowe had now evidently obtained
fresh vigour, and his bellows seemed to have
undergone a thorough repair. On coming
up, he immediately went to his adversary,
led off with his left, which was returned by
Broome on the nose. Rowe attempted to
obtain the fall, but in so doing slipped
down.</p>

<p>     42 and 43.&mdash;&#8203;Slight exchanges, no mischief
done; both down at the ropes.</p>

<p>     44.&mdash;&#8203;Harry hit out left and right on Joe’s
mug, closed, and threw him heavily, falling
on him.</p>

<p>     45.&mdash;&#8203;Broome again touched up Rowe’s
“blow pipe.” Joe immediately insinuated a
tremendous counter-crack on Broome’s head
with his right, which dropped him, and he
fell on his hands and knees and fell forward
on his face. (First knock-down blow for
Rowe.)</p>

<p>     46 and 47.&mdash;&#8203;Counter-hitting left and right,
Rowe occasionally stopping Broome’s left,
but the latter would not be denied, and hit
away until he brought his man to a close,
and they both went down together, Rowe
under. On reaching their seconds’ knees,
their punishment appeared to be about equal,
neither showing many marks beyond those
on Broome’s left eye and cheek on the one
hand, and Rowe’s mouth and nose on the
other. (About this time a cry was raised
that the police had arrived, but we could see
nothing of them, as we were so hemmed in
by the mob, and, as we stated above, it was
impossible for them to get at the combatants,
or any one in the ring.)</p>

<p>     48.&mdash;&#8203;Stinging hits exchanged with the left
to a rally and a close at the ropes, where
Rowe got down to avoid Harry’s friendly
hug.</p>

<p>     49.&mdash;&#8203;Broome’s left eye was now completely
closed, and the surrounding flesh was considerably
swollen; his nose, also, looked very
blue. He went to his man, caught him round
the neck with his left, and fibbed him severely
with the other hand. Rowe at length caught
the offending mawley, and forced Harry’s
head back. After a little struggling, Rowe
slipped down.</p>

<p>     50.&mdash;&#8203;Joe stopped a well-intended smack
from Broome’s left. The latter then made
his “one, two” on Rowe’s mouth and body.
Joe slipped, and Broome was making an upper
cut at him as he went down, but just
succeeded in stopping the delivery in time
to prevent grounds for a claim of “foul.”</p>

<p>    51 and 52.&mdash;&#8203;Some good countering took
place in these rounds with equal advantage,
for what Broome gave on Joe’s mouth and
cheek he received in return on his damaged
ogle and sneezer.</p>

<p>     53.&mdash;&#8203;The men quickly rushed to a close,
and after a short struggle Joe succeeded in
giving Broome a clean somersault over
the ropes, amidst the joyous shouts of his
partisans.</p>

<p>     54 to 57.&mdash;&#8203;Still the same hit-away style of
fighting, no stopping or flinching, Broome
<a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a><span class="pageno">319</span>
occasionally getting his man’s head in chancery
and fibbing. In the 56th round Harry
put in a smasher on the body of Rowe, from
the effects of which he was going down, when
Broome sent in another, which did not reach
him until he was on his knees. Another
claim of “foul” was made by Jem Turner
and Sambo, but the blow was evidently accidental,
and Spring decided “fair.” Had it
been otherwise, it would have been almost
impossible for Spring to see, he was so beset
by the mob who were creating the disturbance
and overwhelming the ring. Spring at
length was compelled to come within the
arena to watch the proceedings. In the
57th round Rowe went down weak. Both
Johnny Broome and Peter Crawley had now
been in the ring during some rounds, Broome
assisting his brother, and Crawley performing
the same kind office for Rowe. Broome
led the way, and his presence excited a
good deal of angry feeling, but it was “six
of one and half-a-dozen of the other.”</p>

<p>     58 and 59.&mdash;&#8203;Rowe was getting weaker,
and Broome was piping. In the latter
round heavy counter-hits were exchanged in
Broome’s corner. The latter then put in a
heavy body blow, from the effects of which
Rowe staggered and went down.</p>

<p>     60.&mdash;&#8203;In-fighting in favour of Rowe, who
made several good hits on Broome’s dial.
Broome retaliated, but not so severely.
They closed at the ropes, and both fell
together. (The ring was now half full of
people, and sticks and whips were being
plied without avail on all sides.)</p>

<p>     61 to 70.&mdash;&#8203;On coming up for the 61st
round, Broome’s face, principally on the left
side, was terribly disfigured, while Rowe’s
right jaw, cheek, and upper lip were so
much cut and swollen as to produce the
appearance of dislocation of the jaw. The
hitting in these rounds was severe, although
Rowe occasionally hit open-handed. In the
close they generally fibbed each other
severely, and fell together. The space in
which they were fighting became gradually
more and more circumscribed, and almost
invariably in the close the ring-keepers were
obliged to surround the combatants, and
literally beat the crowd away, to give room
for them to struggle for the fall, and to
prevent their being injured by the mob.</p>

<p>     71.&mdash;&#8203;Tom Spring now, finding that there
was not the slightest probability of a clear
ring being again obtained, and satisfied that
it would be impossible to obtain fair play,
resigned his office as referee. The seconds
and backers ought then to have each withdrawn
his man; instead of this, however,
the fight was continued amidst the most
dreadful confusion, and in a space about two
yards square, until the 81st round, when the
men were taken away and conveyed on
board the Nymph, after fighting for 2 hours
and 21 minutes. All chance of concluding
the contest had at this time vanished, and,
of course, universal dissatisfaction prevailed.
A cowardly attack was made on Johnny
Broome by some of the disappointed Eastenders,
but Peter Crawley manfully threw
his shield over him, and prevented mischief.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;We have thus, to the best of
our ability, amidst the shameful confusion
which prevailed, endeavoured to give as
accurate a description of this battle as our
opportunities would admit. We can only
repeat that at a very early period of the
battle the crowd completely overwhelmed
the efforts of those who were certainly
anxious and creditably active in their endeavours
to preserve order. The jealousy
of those, however, who could not pay
towards those who had paid was so forcibly
evinced as to prevent all resistance; and
this, combined with a large majority of
Rowe’s friends and partisans, who indulged
in a very unseemly expression of ill-feeling
towards Johnny Broome and his brother,
produced the very unsatisfactory conclusion
at which the affair arrived, and of course
led to the necessity of another meeting before
it could be decided which was the better
man. We confess we do not feel ourselves
justified, from all we have yet seen,
in assigning the palm of decided superiority
to either. They both fought manfully and
bravely, and exhibited all those sterling
qualities which are calculated to reflect
credit upon the characters of British boxers.
There was no flinching, no cowardly
attempts to fall to avoid punishment, nor
were any of those subterfuges adopted on
either side calculated to create the disapprobation
of the spectators. On the contrary,
when permitted by the disgraceful intrusion
of strangers in the ring, they promptly and
fearlessly obeyed the call of time, and hit
away left and right each with a courageous
determination to turn the scale in his
favour. In the last few rounds&mdash;&#8203;or, rather,
scrambles&mdash;&#8203;which took place, we are inclined
to believe that Broome had a little
the advantage; but it would be by no means
just on our parts to give this as a decided
opinion, and the less so as we saw Rowe
run vigorously from the ring to the place of
embarkation, followed by Broome. We
were glad to make our escape from such a
scene, and made our retreat along the banks
of the river to Greenhithe, from whence we
subsequently obtained a passage, not in the
“Nymph,” but in a Gravesend boat, on its way
to Blackwall, and thus did not obtain a close
view of the men. Many heavy blows were
exchanged in the course of the turmoil, and
some one, with a wantonness perfectly indefensible,
flung up a quart bottle in the
air, which, alighting on Johnny Broome’s
head, might have been fatal, and, as it was,
proved anything but agreeable to his feelings.
We cannot too strongly impress upon
the parties concerned in this disgraceful
exhibition that, as in the fable of the goose
and the golden egg, they are sacrificing the
chances of their own future gratification. A
<a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a><span class="pageno">320</span>
clear ring and no favour is the battle-cry of
all fair boxing; and if the spirit of this cry
be once abandoned, it is in vain to hope for
the continuance of those manly demonstrations
of courage and fair play which render
prize-fighting defensible. It seems also to
be forgotten that, by keeping a wide and
extended ring throughout a combat, all
have a fair opportunity of witnessing its
progress; while, by thus closing in, the
greater portion must be debarred from a
view of the combatants, and thus disorder
becomes inevitable. Added to this, the
prejudices of the opponents of the good old
sport become trebly fortified, and the interference
of the magistrates and the police
will find not only apologists, but eulogists,
even among those who heretofore would
have been the first to decry their interference.
Aquatic excursions, by limiting
the number of spectators, were, in the first
instance, adopted as a prudent and judicious
move, and so long as they were confined, by
a fair charge, to the men and their real
supporters, this object was gained; but the
unfair system of starting opposition boats,
at low prices, by enabling the worst class of
Ring-goers to obtrude upon the scene of
action, has superseded this intention, and it
now only remains to adopt some new expedient
by which fair play and good order
can be maintained. Nothing but a determined
coalition upon the part of the milling
fraternity themselves will prevent the repetition
of evils which must altogether extinguish
their popularity as a class.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Great complaints were made of Broome having gone into the ring to
assist his brother, which was decidedly contrary to the rules of the Ring, and
led to Crawley following so bad an example. It was undoubtedly wrong;
but some allowances must be made for the horrible confusion which prevailed,
and the utter impossibility of the referee calling for a stringent
attention to the rule referred to; although in two instances when Broome
had intruded he peremptorily ordered him out, and was obeyed. It must
be distinctly understood that any man, save the seconds, thus interfering
with his man loses the fight.</p>

<p>Broome soon recovered from the contusions on his face, although when
we saw him on the Friday the marks were sufficiently apparent. The forebone
of the thumb on his right hand was, however, fractured. This
occurred in the fourth round, and the repeated use of the hand afterwards
rendered the consequences more serious. Rowe’s physiognomy was still far
from symmetrical. His face on the right side was dreadfully swollen, and
the cut on his lip severe and deep. The left side of his countenance also
showed obvious symptoms of unpleasant visitations. In other respects the
men were little damaged; but Rowe had clearly got the larger share of the
punishment. His left hand was also much puffed. It was stated that for
the present it would be impossible for Broome to use his right hand, and
Crawley readily agreed that the day for the renewal of the battle should
not be fixed till a surgeon had pronounced when the damaged feeler was
likely to be fit for service. Johnny Broome proposed to give £5 towards
Rowe’s training expenses, provided the match were made for £100, and to
come off in four months. To this Crawley could make no response, as he
had his apprehensions of being able to get any addition to the stakes
down.
</p>
<a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a><span class="pageno">321</span>

<p>The final agreement was that the renewal of the combat should take
place on the 6th of May; Peter Crawley and Johnny Broome to name the
locality. At a subsequent meeting at Spring’s, it being mentioned that the
6th of May was the day of running the Chester Cup, the date was altered to
the 13th by mutual agreement, and the place of rendezvous was settled for
Ensham, Oxfordshire, six miles from the University city. On the overnight the
men and their mentors set off for that locality. The “London Particulars,”
however, contented themselves with the half-past seven morning train, and
the quarter to ten fast ditto, as their method of reaching the trysting-place.
Soon after eleven all was alive in Ensham, and the cavalcade moved off
for the battle-field, many of the drags being of the style and pattern that
bespoke the Corinthian quality of their owners or occupants. At twelve
the Commissary and assistants had made a model ring and enclosure in an
emerald-green meadow near Ensham, and soon after Harry Broome, his
brother Johnny, his seconds and friends, came on the ground on a four-in-hand;
while Rowe, under the broad shadow of Peter Crawley, escorted by
a numerous cavalcade of equestrians and charioteers, with a long queue of
pedestrians was also “thar.” Harry Broome was waited on in the ring by
his brother and Sam Simmonds, of Birmingham; Rowe by Jack Macdonald
and Bill Hayes. Broome’s colours were blue with a large white spot,
Rowe’s the old blue birdseye.</p>

<p>After some little delay in the choice of a referee, “time” was called, and
the men, in fighting costume, advanced from their corners and shook hands.
Young Harry, in point of condition, was all that his best friends could
desire; he was indeed a model of youthful health and activity. He stood
slightly over his opponent, and had evidently the advantage in length of
reach. Rowe looked far more solid and burly at his weight (10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 5<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>),
and was much less graceful in his movements; indeed, his look lacked the
animation and confidence which beamed on the features of his youthful
antagonist. The friends of Rowe were, nevertheless, sanguine of his success,
and took the 5 and 6 to 4 readily which some of Broome’s patrons offered.</p>

<p>At a few minutes before one the men and their seconds crossed hands,
the latter retired to their corners, and the twain stood up for</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On throwing themselves into
position each put out his feelers and advanced
and retreated several times. After
one or two feinting dodges Rowe tried his
left, but was short; they got closer to their
work, and left-hand counters were exchanged,
Rowe catching it on the mouth and
Broome slightly on the cheek. After a break
away they again approached, and once more
exchanged counter-hits with the left, Broome
<a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a><span class="pageno">322</span>
getting well home on Rowe’s kissing organ,
whence blood immediately trickled, and
“first blood” was claimed for Broome and
awarded. Broome rushed in, caught Rowe
round the neck under his left arm, fibbed a
little with his right, hitting up, then, giving
him a leg, threw and fell on him. (7 to 4
on Broome offered.)</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Rowe, on coming to the scratch,
showed a stream of the crimson fluid from
the side of his mouth. Broome led off with
his left, but was neatly stopped, and in the
second attempt equally well foiled. Slight
exchanges, and Broome closed, and, after a
short struggle, had his man down, but came
himself to the ground rather heavily.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Rowe short with his left. Broome
quickly caught him a smasher on his
damaged mouth, repeating the dose twice,
and playing round his man with a celerity
that reminded us of Young Dutch Sam.
Rowe tried to get home, first with one hand
then the other, but was short, from the
rapid shifting of his adversary. In the close
Broome tried to get the lock, but Rowe kept
his legs wide and declined the intended
favour. Broome tried to hit up with the
right, but Rowe slipped on one knee, catching
a stinger on the jaw as he was falling,
and Harry tumbling over him.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;On Rowe coming up, his left eye, left
cheek, and mouth gave evidence of renewed
visitations. Harry, though flushed in the
frontispiece, was not yet “adorned with
cuts.” Rowe hit short with the left, and
then stopped two or three attempts by
Harry to get home with the same hand. In
trying to return Rowe hit rather in the style
of the sparring school, drawing back his
elbow just as his fist reached its destination,
instead of letting the blow go straight from
the shoulder. A rally, in which Rowe succeeded
in planting his left on Broome’s eye,
and then stepped in with a rattling hit on
the jaw that seemed for a moment to stagger
the Young’un; in fact it looked for a moment
as if he would go down from the stunning
visitation; but he did not, and Rowe closed
and threw his man amidst vociferous acclamations
from the East-enders.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Broome came up smiling, steady, and
resolute, showing little effects of the last
round. He made play, but Rowe easily
stopped two long shots from the left. Rowe
retreated, but did not succeed in drawing
Broome near enough, so the latter, after an
exchange or two, got within distance, delivering
left and right heavily on the head and
body, then catching his man firmly on his
left arm, he “fiddled” him with the right,
and as he struggled away gave him the leg
and fell heavily on him. (The Rowe-ites
mute with astonishment.)</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Both showed signs of punishment,
Rowe on mouth, eye, cheek, and left ear,
Broome on the left cheek. Rowe short with
the left; a rally, when Harry caught Rowe an
upper-cut with the left, but Rowe grappled
him, and Harry got down through his hands,
amidst the jeers and scoffs of the Rowe
party.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Broome came up slowly; he sparred
and shifted ground, but Rowe would not be
drawn. Broome sent out his left, but was
short, and in a second attempt just reached
Joe’s neck with his right, who threw his
head back with great quickness out of the
way of mischief. Three times in succession
Rowe stopped Broome’s left with great neatness.
(“That’s the way to break his heart,”
cried Jack Macdonald.) After some more
clever sparring, in which little damage was
done, Broome closed, and again threw his
man, falling on him.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Broome was again neatly stopped, but
he persevered and got in a smasher on Rowe’s
damaged mouth, who counter-hit, but not
effectively. Broome got in to half-arm and
visited Rowe’s left eye. Joe, not relishing
these pops, dropped on his knees, but Harry
caught him with his left arm and lifted him
bodily up from the ground, thus displaying
immense muscular strength, threw him and
dropped on him. (2 to 1 on Broome.)</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Harry came up smiling confidently.
He led off with his left, but Rowe stopped
him three or four times beautifully. (Applause.)
At length they got close, and
Broome twice in succession got home on
Rowe’s mouth and eye. Rowe, wild and
stung, rushed into close quarters, but Broome
got away, broke ground, and twice or three
times popped in sharp hits in the face.
Rowe got down in his own corner during a
rally.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Broome played round his man
actively, occasionally getting in a “little
one.” Rowe was slow, and stood steadily on
the defensive. He evidently reckoned on
Broome tiring himself by doing all the work.
He could not, however, keep Broome out,
who gave him a tidy smack on the cheek, and
Rowe got down.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Rowe still slow and on the defensive.
Broome put in a nobber, and Rowe was
down on the grass.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Rowe stopped a succession of hits with
the left, but Broome would not come in to
be propped; at last they exchanged two or
three sharp hits, when Broome closed and
threw Rowe, but not heavily.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Good out-fighting on the part of
Broome, who planted on Rowe’s neck and
ear. Rowe continued his stopping, and
stepping back, until Broome, tired of the
game, fought in, closed, and threw him.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Broome got home with his left, a cutting
blow; Rowe let go right and left wildly,
of which Broome took advantage, closed,
caught him round the waist, and flung him
cleverly.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Rowe still stopped steadily, but was
sadly short in the returns. As we have before
said, his blows did not go from the
shoulder, but partook of the flip-flap character
of the sparring school. Broome advanced
<a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a><span class="pageno">323</span>
and retreated, and at last, springing in,
caught Rowe in the mark with his left, and
gave the “first knock down.”</p>

<p>     16 to 19.&mdash;&#8203;Broome made the fighting, got
in his left, and threw his man in all these
rounds.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Rowe maintained his steadiness
amazingly. He stopped with precision, and
was getting down from Broome’s onslaught
when Harry seized him, lifted him by sheer
strength, and threw him.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Rowe getting slow, and apparently
vexed at not being able to get his man to
hitting distance. Broome played half-round
to the right, then to the left. Rowe went
in desperately and forced a rally, in which
he got home his right a sounder on Broome’s
jaw, and both were down, amidst the uproarious
cheers of the East-enders, who
seemed “thankful for small mercies.”</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Broome showed symptoms of fatigue;
he coughed and hemmed, stepped back, and
rubbed his arms, leisurely surveying his antagonist.
“Don’t be gammoned,” said Bill
Hayes; Rowe nodded his head assentingly.
As Rowe would not advance Broome went
to him, and in some sharp exchanges hit
hardest and oftenest. Broome’s right came
in sharp contact with Rowe’s sconce as he
was going down, and Broome was seen pulling
at his right little finger, to which some
mischance had happened.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;On coming to the scratch Broome
again sparred <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la distance</span>. “Go in,” cried
Crawley to Rowe; “his hands are gone, it’s
all your own.” This was an error; “the
wish was father to the thought,” for Harry
frustrated his adversary’s attempt by sending
his left slap in Rowe’s mazzard, hit him with
the supposed disabled right in the ribs, closed,
and got him down.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Broome popped in his left, closed,
and rolled over his man as he got down.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Rowe, getting slower and slower,
seemed to content himself with guarding
his head and ribs, and shifting. Broome
bided his time, but at length got home, and
muzzled poor Joe, who went to grass somehow.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;As before, Rowe on the defensive,
stopping, but not returning. Broome followed
him up, forced him on to the ropes,
and rolled over with him.</p>

<p>     27th and last.&mdash;&#8203;Broome came to the scratch
cheerfully; his seconds certainly sent him
up remarkably clean. Although Rowe, as
before, stopped an experimental left-hander
or two, Harry gave him two severe smashers
on the mouth and cheek, then closing as
Rowe was trying to get down, he gave him
the crook, and fell heavily on him. It was
all over. Rowe, though still strong on his
legs, declined to continue the contest; and
Bill Hayes threw up the sponge in token of
defeat. Young Harry was highly elated. He
jumped about the ring like a parched pea in
a frying-pan, shook hands with his opponent,
and performed a <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de théâtre</span> by pressing
the winning-colours to his lips, and then
waving them round his head. At this moment
Harry showed no further discolouration
of the face than a blue mark under the
left eye. One of the bones of his right-hand,
however, was broken, and from that round
it was of little effectual service, though he
used it several times. The fight lasted
exactly fifty-seven minutes, and from first
to last was conducted with the utmost fairness,
and without the slightest interruption
from the surrounding multitude, which was
largely increased by the accession of several
Whitsun clubs, who were celebrating their
holiday in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Broome won the fight from
superior tact, good in-fighting, and the clever
use of his legs, both in getting away and
throwing. To the quick use of his left&mdash;&#8203;for
he did but little with the right&mdash;&#8203;the downfall
of his game antagonist is also to be
ascribed. Rowe, we must confess, from what
we had previously seen, somewhat disappointed
us. Not only was he slow, and
generally short, but his hits were elbow-deliveries,
while, before the battle was half
through, he adopted such a determined line
of mere defensive tactics as never could
have gained him victory over such a courageous
and active adversary as Young
Broome. We almost suspected he had made
up his mind to defeat early in the fight.
Broome’s youth, though much against him,
was relied on by Rowe, mistakingly, as the
event proved. He was neither so much exhausted,
or even tired, as his older opponent.
It would be prudent, from the injury he has
twice sustained in his right-hand, that he
should, for a time, retire from the active
pursuit of the profession he has adopted,
until gristle has hardened to bone, and well-knit
sinew and tendon replace his youthful
rounded muscle. That Young Harry
possesses steadiness, self-possession, game,
and confidence he has fully shown, and
these, aided by the increasing strength and
stamina which time must bring, must ensure
him a high position among pugilistic professionals.
The weather was, throughout the
day, most favourable, and order and regularity
admirably maintained, Spring, Peter
Crawley, Jem Burn, Owen Swift, Johnny
Hannan, Jem Turner, Young Reid, Jemmy
Welsh, and others of the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps d’élite</span>, contributing
greatly to this desirable state of
things.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>At this period (1846) there resided at Birmingham a boxer of high local
repute, some five years the senior of Harry, and still in his prime, who, in
the opinion of his fellow-townsmen, was well fitted to check the triumphant
<a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a><span class="pageno">324</span>
career of the juvenile representative of the house of Broome, which was
considered to have transferred its pugilistic fame from its native place to
London. This was Ben Terry, whose successive defeats of Jem Hodgkiss,
Forster, Davis of Birmingham, and Tom Davis, in 1841, 1842, 1843, and
1844, all middle-weights, had earned for him a character approaching invincibility.
After some cavilling with Johnny Broome in times passed by,
before that boxer retired from the Ring, which, however, ended in nothing.
Ben now proposed a match for £100 a side, with Young Harry, at 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>
4<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, and the youngster, nothing loth, closed with the offer. There was
much partisan feeling mixed up in the affair, and on February 3rd, 1846,
the men met at Shrivenham, Berkshire, on the Great Western line. There
was tedious disputation on the choice of a referee; and the behaviour of
the partisans of Terry was simply disgraceful, and marked most significantly
the falling fortunes of the Ring. The unfinished battle, which
occupies an immense and undue space in the contemporary report, is not
worth preserving. Suffice it to say that for the first half hour the fighting of
Harry was singularly irregular and wild, and only accountable upon the
supposition, loudly proclaimed by Brother Johnny, that Young Harry had
been stupefied by the surreptitious introduction of some drug in his drink&mdash;&#8203;in
short, had been “hocussed.” We, who witnessed the fight, however
loth we should be to admit such a shameful act without clear evidence,
could not resist the suspicion of some foul play. Terry, however, seemed
to fight very little better than his opponent. After the 35th round, the
confusion and disorder defied description. The ring was broken in, and
filled with an unruly crowd; repeated claims of “foul” were made from
both sides; the referee was sought to be intimidated by uproar and threats;
and finally the fight was claimed for Terry, without any decision being
given by the properly constituted authorities, and the respective parties returned&mdash;&#8203;the
one to Birmingham, the other to London, to wrangle over the
destination of the £200 in the hands of the stakeholder. After a tedious
controversy and furious mutual recriminations, it is clear that the Terry
party did not fancy a second meeting, and the affair ended by Johnny
Broome, on behalf of his brother, consenting to draw stakes on receipt of
a douceur of £5. Terry, who was subsequently beaten by Coates and
Posh Price, died at Birmingham, October 12th, 1862.</p>

<p>We have noted in the life of the Tipton Slasher, how, after his defeat of
Paddock, in December, 1850, he laid public claim to the Championship;
how Bendigo, after stating that he was prepared to fight for £500, and
<a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a><span class="pageno">325</span>
no less, backed out when the Tipton offered to meet him for that amount;
and further, that he, the Tipton, would fight any man for £100 or
£200. This challenge was unanswered until May, 1851, when Broome
declared himself ready to make a deposit for an “Unknown,” for £200
a side. This was accepted. At a subsequent meeting at Johnny Broome’s,
on the 2nd of June, the articles were completed, and the battle agreed to
take place within four months. On the occasion first named poor Tom
Spring, who had in this case undertaken to see to the interests of the
Slasher in London, lay stretched on a bed of sickness, struggling with that
grim antagonist who soon after gave him his final fall; consequently
Johnny Broome claimed and received forfeit at the second deposit, the
Slasher’s friends not putting in an appearance. In the following week a
gleam of hoped-for health on the part of Spring, and the arrival of Perry himself
in London, led to a demonstration, and a sum of money was deposited in
the hands of the Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> on the part of Tipton, to meet the
“Unknown” for the sum proposed. That the “Great Unknown” was a
mystery, like the authorship of “Junius,” and, for a time, the Waverley
Novels, was evident, for men did not scruple to say that Johnny had had
a lucky escape from “a bit of bounce” by the receipt of the small amount
down. The mystery, however, was quickly dissipated, for at the next
meeting, to the astonishment of all, Young Harry announced himself to be
the “mysterious stranger,” prepared to join issue with the ponderous
Slasher, and from that evening the match progressed satisfactorily.</p>

<p>In the interim, the Tipton, after a provincial tour, went into training at
Hoylake, in Cheshire, under the mentorship of Jem Ward, and the superintendence
of Jemmy the Black (Young Molyneaux). Harry was, of course,
looked after by his brother, but was unable to do so much work as he
required, owing to the necessity that arose of constantly shifting his quarters.
This, we may now state, was owing to the embarrassed state of his pecuniary
affairs, in connection with the Opera Tavern, in the Haymarket, of
which he was then the landlord.</p>

<p>When we last saw Harry in the lists, in his interrupted combat with Ben
Terry, he was looked upon as a “middle-weight,” his height 5 feet 9 inches,
his weight 10½st.; and from this circumstance, despite the assertion that
he had grown nearly two inches in stature, and would go to scale full two
stone heavier in muscle and bone, there was an obstinate incredulity on the
part of many who thought they knew the man, with respect to the 10½st.
Harry and the 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> Slasher ever facing each other in the Ring.
</p>
<a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a><span class="pageno">326</span>

<p>The stakeholder, upon whom devolved the duty of naming the place of
fighting, selected Mildenhall. Johnny Broome had a predilection for Six
Mile Bottom, near Newmarket, as suitable for the convenience of the sporting
men going to the First October Meeting, but this he subsequently
abandoned. The place having been appointed, Johnny Broome and Young
Spring, on behalf of the Slasher, engaged a special train on the Eastern
Counties Line, which, it was notified, would start at half-past eight. There
was little excitement abroad, for the eve of so important an event
as that which was to decide the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexata quæstio</span> as to who was to be Champion
of England. It is true, the houses of the two Broomes, and the Castle
Tavern, were thronged, but we did not hear of a bet being made, and a
strong impression prevailed up to the very day that something would occur
to prevent the issue of the battle. On reaching the platform whence the
train was to start we found the assemblage was limited, and we should
calculate that not more than one hundred took their places in the carriages,
so that these who speculated on gain were on the wrong side of the post.
With the exception of Peter Crawley and Old Tom Oliver, we recognised
none of the representatives of the old school.</p>

<p>The travellers having taken their seats&mdash;&#8203;the Tipton, accompanied by
Nobby Clarke and Molyneaux, being among them&mdash;&#8203;the whistle sounded, and
off went the party. A good deal of consternation was expressed by some
persons at the non-appearance of Broome; but, on the train arriving at
Bishop Stortford, all doubt was set at rest by his presence on the platform.
The train once more got under weigh, and shortly the goal was reached.
Pursuing a winding lane, the veteran Commissary led the way to the field
where Bendigo won his parting laurel from Paddock, in 1850. This
ground, however, was found to be under plough, and the travellers had to
go further afield; nevertheless, all was soon in apple-pie order for business.
The London train band was reinforced by a few of the Norfolk and Suffolk
Militiamen, and a cavalry contingent from Newmarket, and by one o’clock
there was a tolerable muster round the roped arena. At ten minutes after
that hour the Tipton hero advanced to the ring-side, and, removing his nob-cover,
tossed it gaily within the magic circle. Harry was not long in
answering the Tipton’s call for him to come forth, and was loudly cheered
on presenting himself. After shaking hands, the difficult point of choosing
a referee came on the <em>tapis</em>. This knotty question seemed likely to occupy
the whole day, for to each proposition a negative was offered, chiefly by the
Tipton and his friends. One hour and forty minutes were thus cut to
<a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a><span class="pageno">327</span>
waste, but at twenty-five minutes past two the differences ended by the
selection of Peter Crawley, and the men commenced their toilettes. Crawley
had been previously rejected by the Tipton, from an apprehension that his
predilections were in favour of Broome; and it was not until Harry offered
to fight without a referee that he at last consented. The choice made, the
Slasher approached Crawley, and said all he desired was a fair fight and no
favour. If he did anything foul he must abide by the consequences, and if
his antagonist did wrong he hoped an equal measure of justice would be
meted out to him. Crawley said he might rely on his performing his duty
strictly and impartially. All he desired was to see a fair and manly contest,
and to see it fairly and manfully fought out.</p>

<p>The attendants on the Slasher were Nobby Clarke and Jem Molyneaux.
The bold Harry was esquired by Callaghan, of Derby, and Bob Castles,
Johnny, of course, being in the corner. A little interlude, in the shape of
a shindy between Molyneaux and Callaghan, enlivened the interval of suspense,
but, on everything being ready, they were soon quieted down. The
ring was admirably kept throughout, Tom Callas, Jerry Noon, Mallet, and
others lending a helping hand. The betting at the commencement was 2
to 1 on the Slasher; and at forty-five minutes past two business began.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;And so the men stood up, and
all doubts, fears, and suspicions as to whether
there would or would not be a fight were
at an end, and the question was now to be
set at rest as to what sort of a fight
those present were to witness, and we
were to record. No sooner had the youthful
Harry struck his canvass, and exhibited
himself in Nature’s buff suit, than
an almost audible buzz of surprise and
admiration broke from the spectators.
Never did gladiator of old offer a finer
study for the chisel of the sculptor or the
pencil of the painter. 5<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> 10½<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> in stature,
his height was only fairly proportioned to
his weight, 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> on the morning of
the battle, which, by-the-bye, was 10<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> too
much. His chest and scapulæ, with their
masses of prominent and rigid muscle, were
almost preternaturally developed; and as he
swung his long, round arms, with the motion
of one practising with the dumb-bells, closing
and unclosing his hands (black with the
astringent juices applied to them), to supple
his joints for the impending encounter, all
seemed to agree that he was up to the
standard of weight and measure which the
veteran Captain Barclay said “was big
enough to fight any two-legged creature
that ever walked.” There is much, however,
in “a name”&mdash;&#8203;despite Juliet’s declaration
to the contrary, which, coming from a green
young Miss, don’t carry much authority&mdash;&#8203;and,
accordingly, the old ring-goers were
half inclined to a belief in the Slasher’s
invincibility, and doubted whether the
audacious “boy,” as the Tipton contemptuously
called him in our hearing, would
stand up to his ancient friend and fellow-trainer
in bygone days. That this was a
mistake was soon apparent. Throwing up
his hands with smiling confidence, Harry
toed the scratch, saying, as he did so,
“Here I am, old boy, and I mean to win
to-day.” The Tipton grinned&mdash;&#8203;the absence
of his incisors imparting that expression to
his laugh. On the present occasion, though
he looked brown, hardy, and sunburnt,
there was somewhat of an antiquated cut
about his figure-head which was not observable
on his last public appearance, which,
as we have already recorded, was with Paddock,
in December, 1850. His frame, however,
showed no waste or diminution of its
formidable proportions. Poised upon his
letter K-like pedestals, his huge upper
works, broad shoulders, immense blade-bones,
wide loins and well-ribbed carcase
showed the ponderous athlete, though the
bloom and freshness of youth had faded
<a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a><span class="pageno">328</span>
from his skin. It was clear he meant to
give no rest, and as little room and opportunity,
to his antagonist as he could help.
Harry offered with his left high up, in the
direction of the Slasher’s nob; it was a sort
of measuring, and he stepped aside, breaking
ground with graceful agility. Slasher followed
him, when he stepped aside laughing,
closing and unclosing his hands, playing
about out of reach, and sparring. “Go to
him, Tipton,” cried Jemmy Wharton; “he’s
afraid of you.” The Tipton did as he was
bid, and Harry retreated until near the
ropes. The Tipton let go his right, and
just reached Harry’s ribs, who rapidly
caught him a cross-counter with the left on
the face. A couple of rather hasty exchanges
brought the men together; they separated,
and Broome delivered an upper cut on the
Slasher’s face, who retaliated on Harry’s
body so effectively that he slipped in jumping
back, and fell, throwing up his feet as
he reached the ground, to prevent the Tipton
falling on him, and, when he found himself
safely landed, bringing his heels over
his head with a spring, and turning a complete
somersault. A claim for a knock-down;
but it was anything but that. Four
minutes. (6 to 4 on the Tipton, and no
takers.)</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Harry came up laughing, and nodded
at the Tipton, who laughed and nodded in
return. Nothing was the matter on either
side. Slasher followed Broome, who retreated
to the ropes. “Get nearer, Harry,”
cried Brother Johnny. “Don’t go after him,”
said Molyneaux, and the Tipton in turn retired
to the scratch, to which he pointed
down with his index-finger. Harry stepped
right up to his head, and delivered his left
flush on the Slasher’s mouth. (Cheers.)
There was a momentary pause, Slasher pursued
Harry to the ropes, where the latter
jumped into a close, and caught his opponent
round the waist. Harry tried to get
the lock, but both were down, Tipton having
hold of the upper rope with his right.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Broome was all confidence and elasticity.
He went up to the Slasher, and reached
his head, then retreated from the return.
“He’ll stand it,” cried Callaghan. The Tipton
got in his left on Harry’s right cheek,
who, in return, gave him a sounding flush
hit on the olfactory organ. The Slasher let
fly right and left, and the men closed near
the centre stake. Harry got an unmistakable
outside look with his right leg over the
crooked knee of the Slasher. There were a
few seconds of severe struggling, when
Broome, having fixed his hold, brought the
Slasher over on his back. Down he came,
shaking the earth with the concussion, his
shoulders, neck, and back part of his caput
first saluting the ground, while Harry rolled
over on him. The effect was electrifying:
even “Peter the Great” gave an audible
grunt in unison with the “thud” that accompanied
the Slasher’s downfall. There
lay the crooked Colossus prostrate, till his
active seconds, seizing him by the legs and
wings, conveyed him to his corner, whither
Harry followed him with inquiring eyes.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Tipton came well and boldly, but not
till time had been several times vociferously
called, the Broomites evidently in most
hurry. Harry shifted round and round the
corners, the Slasher following him. Harry
reached the Tipton’s mouth smartly, who
let go both hands. The hit sounded. Broome
closed, and tried the lock again. The Tipton
avoided his hips, and both were on the
grass.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;The Tipton had shaken off the effects
of his fall. He tried to gammon Harry
within reach of his formidable right by short
feints with the left. As this did not have the
desired effect, he went in, hitting out with
both hands. Harry nailed him on the frontispiece,
and as he came on again, administered
an upper-cut. It was not quite close
enough, or it might have told tales. In the
close the Tipton was under at the ropes, but
it was no detriment.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Broome went to the Slasher’s head in
the most manly style, and popped in one.
“Fortune favours the brave.” Tipton retorted,
but missed one very mischievous hit.
The men closed, Harry hit up, catching the
Tipton on the nose, and both were down in
the scramble&mdash;&#8203;the Tipton, if either, first.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;“First blood” for Broome, which was
unmistakably distilling from the Slasher’s
nose, to which he put his hand as if to feel
it. The Tipton forced Broome to the ropes,
threatening with his right, where they
closed, and after some not very effective
fibbing, Broome brought the Tipton down
on his back, falling on his stomach with his
latter end. (An offer to take evens on
Broome.)</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Smart active sparring and a bustling
exchange. Harry gave the Slasher a very
heavy hit on the jaw, producing a slight
cut. The Tipton retorted with a nobber,
and also sent home a body-hit. Whether
the Tipton’s right hand had lost its cunning
or not, these ribbers did not seem to stagger
the Young One as they did former adversaries.
Still, the old one rattled in, and in
the scuffle was jobbed in the head, till at the
end of the round Broome pushed him from
him sideways with both hands, when he got
down. Bellows to mend on both sides.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher came up grinning, but his
merriment looked rather forced, although
the hitting had left but little traces on his
hard features. He hit very short with his
left, and Broome walked round smiling.
There was a close at the ropes in Harry’s
corner, in which the Tipton got Broome
awkwardly over them, and hung on him,
holding the rope with his right, his left
hand being across Harry’s face. The rope
was slacked, and Harry was let down. The
referee was appealed to, who ordered the
fight to proceed.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Exchanges: Harry gave the Tipton
a blow on the left eye that raised a lump,
<a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a><span class="pageno">329</span>
then swung round and broke away from the
return. He jobbed the Slasher as he advanced,
but was driven to the ropes, whence
he suddenly sprang forward, took a half-arm
hit, and making his favourite grip,
brought the Tipton over&mdash;&#8203;a heavy fall&mdash;&#8203;tumbling
on him with his knees. As Harry
lay on the grass, he blew like a grampus.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher came slowly up. There
was a short pause, when again Broome went
up to his head. The Slasher’s right reached
Harry’s body, who put in a sharp left-hander
that cut the Tipton’s lip; there was some
quick half-arm hitting, in which Broome
delivered a clever upper-cut with his right,
and both were down. Broome uppermost,
the crimson fluid from the Slasher’s nose
and lip smearing Harry’s frontispiece as
they embraced.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;The Tipton bored Harry to the ropes,
was on to him before he got his chance for a
lunge, and had him down in a scramble.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Harry retreated to the ropes. The
Tipton followed. Broome stopped his left,
and shifted from his right, but got a slight
taste as he broke ground, and moved round
his man. Harry dashed at the Slasher, and
got within his guard. There was a short
scrambling rally, when the Tipton got
down to avoid the lock. Offers to take
evens, and then to bet the short odds on
“the Young’un.” Bob Castles retired from
Broome’s corner in this round, and his place
was supplied by Macdonald. An objection
to the change of seconds overruled.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Broome milled prettily on the retreat,
the Tipton hitting remarkably short
with his left. Harry unclosed his hands,
and shifting round towards the Slasher’s
corner, said, cheerfully, “I’ll take odds ‘the
boy’ licks him without a black eye.” The
Tipton was evidently more bothered than
beaten, and the facility with which he was
thrown made him put on his considering
cap. Broome went up to his head, as if to
attack, but as quickly stepped back. The
Slasher followed, and let go both hands, his
right alone getting home. Harry turned at
the instant, hit up sharply with the left,
and weaving away, the Tipton got down.
In the in-fighting there were some heavy
hits exchanged, and Broome’s over-weight
told sadly on his bellows, which heaved and
jerked like those of a pumped-out steeplechaser.</p>

<p>     15th and last.&mdash;&#8203;There was a little squabble
about time, the Slasher slowest from his
corner. Both sides seemed somewhat inclined
to spar for wind. Harry dashed in,
evidently with the intention of closing and
trying for a heave. He hit the Tipton on
the chin, but the Ould’un got away, as if to
get room for his right. Harry advanced,
closed, and a struggle took place, each
attempting to hit. The Tipton grasped
him tightly with his left, and was trying to
hit with his right, when Harry slipped down
on both knees. The Tipton let go his right
just as he reached the ground, giving him a
decided nobber, which certainly did not
reach its destination till Harry was down. It
was the work of a moment. The shouts
from all sides were tremendous. Broome’s
seconds ran to the umpires and referee, as
did the ever-active Molyneaux, on the side
of the Tipton. There was a short pause,
during which “Peter the Great” declared
he had not yet been formally appealed to.
This was done, the umpires, of course,
disagreeing. “A most deliberate foul,” said
“Peter the Great,” and the ring broke up.
Thirty-three minutes had sufficed for the
present decision of the question, “Who is
the Champion of England?”</p>

<p>          As the ponderous Peter left the roped
enclosure, another instance was added to
the many previous of the suicidal conduct of
the present race of Ring men. The referee
was surrounded by a vociferous and violent
mob, whose language was of the most outrageous
description. The Tipton himself,
too, so “raised the dander” of the referee
by his remarks and conduct, that the veteran
Crawley declared he would fight for his
credit and integrity, and, to the no small
amusement of many, was disencumbering
his portly person of his outer coat, to inflict
summary punishment on his assailants, when
the Tipton was forced away.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Upon this battle, ending in a
manner so unsatisfactory, few remarks are
necessary. The style of fighting will speak
for itself. It was clear that the Tipton was
surprised by the vigour and determination
of his youthful opponent, and not less so at
the manner in which he exhibited his throwing
powers; for, in closing, not only was
Harry the better wrestler, but apparently
the stronger man. How the battle would
have terminated had it proceeded in the
ordinary way it is impossible to say, and in
this respect opinions naturally differed. For,
on the one hand, the little punishment that
was administered came from the Young One,
while the Old One had evidently lost none
of his personal confidence, and no doubt
anticipated that Harry would out-fight himself,
and, by the rapidity of his movements,
increase that exhaustion which had already
shown itself at the conclusion of some of
the earlier rounds. The sudden termination
of the battle came upon all by surprise, and
few believed that there was a “deliberate”
intention on the part of the Tipton to
administer the blow which was pronounced
“foul.” That Harry was on his knees when
he received the ugly hit we can aver, as we
were seated by the side of the referee at the
time of the appeal. The men were certainly
in a scrambling close at the moment; and it
was obvious that, while Harry desired to get
out of trouble, the Tipton felt inclined to
make the most of his fancied advantage.
Crawley’s experience thoroughly enabled
him to form a correct opinion, and we have
no reason to believe that his judgment was
<a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a><span class="pageno">330</span>
not given fairly and impartially. Of course
those not over-honest persons, who always
attribute unworthy motives to others, assert
that Crawley’s prepossessions were in favour
of Broome, and that this was the reason why
the Tipton originally objected to his being
selected as referee. To this we can distinctly
oppose that, to our own knowledge,
the bias of Peter, if he had any, would have
carried him the other way. Such, however,
was not the opinion of the Tipton nor of
his friends, as the latter, on the following
day, served the stakeholder with notice
“not to part with their money,” and the
Tipton still asserted himself to be “Champion
of England.”</p>

<p>     Upon this unsportsmanlike proceeding
the Editor commented with much severity,
arguing that if such practices were pursued,
there would be an end to all confidence
between man and man in sporting matters,
and would assuredly deter any one from
posting money on any similar event, as well
as from holding stakes.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Harry Orme having, as we have seen in the preceding chapter, defeated
Aaron Jones a second time, was strongly urged to put forth his claim to
the Championship, and to meet Harry Broome on his “advertised” terms.
Months, however, passed before the match was made. First Broome made
one stipulation, and then Orme’s friends showed their “stupid cleverness”
in a counter-proposition, and there was a cannonade of angry correspondence
of the most futile controversial character. Late in the year 1852,
however, articles were signed and delivered for a fight to come off on the
18th of April, 1853, for £250 a side, the Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> to name the
place of fighting, and also appoint a referee.</p>

<p>Harry, who since developing into a Boniface had become excessively
corpulent, at once placed himself under the care of Levi Eckersley, at
Cleave Hill, near Cheltenham, and here diligently subjected himself to
an immense amount of work. Orme went into training near Maidstone,
whence, the Monday before the battle, he removed to Greenstreet Green,
in Kent.</p>

<p>It being stipulated in the articles that the stakeholder should name the
whereabouts for the event, a special train was engaged on the Eastern
Counties Railway, for “an excursion of 100 miles or thereabouts,” the
exact spot being undivulged to the general sporting public, lest the gentry
then known as “Cheapsiders” should get down “by hook or by crook,”
and, by alarming the county, spoil sport. The arrangements with the
railway company were made with despatch, and the gentlemen at the
Shoreditch Station took every care to make such dispositions on the eventful
morning as effectually to prevent any of the unprivileged classes from
obtaining admittance. The time for starting was nominally a quarter-past
eight, but long before that hour the neighbourhood of Shoreditch was
in a perfect ferment; the streets and the station-yard were crowded with
spectators anxious to get a glimpse of the chief performers in the
forthcoming drama; but in this they were disappointed, as they had
<a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a><span class="pageno">331</span>
both proceeded a certain distance on the line of march on the previous
day. As the time for starting approached, the arrival of cabs and other
vehicles was incessant, and it was perfectly clear that there would be a
very large muster of patrons of the sport, the majority of whom were what
Pierce Egan would have called “reg’lar nobs and tip-top swells,” but who
are, in the present Ring vernacular, classed as patrician and Corinthian
patrons of the noble art. At no fight for many years past had there been
such a congregation of noblemen and gentlemen; and certainly at no
encounter since that between Caunt and Bendigo, in 1845, was so much
interest excited. Among the company present we were glad to observe
some patrons of the Ring of the Old School&mdash;&#8203;gentlemen who remembered
the battles of Cribb, Spring, Hickman (the Gas-man), Oliver, &amp;c. There
was also a good sprinkling of Turfites present, attracted partly owing to its
being a bye-day in the racing world, and partly by the fact that Orme’s
backer was a gentlemen well known in the betting-ring. Among the latest
arrivals at the station was the “Arch” Bishop of Bond Street, with a considerable
number of his flock. The reverend “gent.” although suffering
from gout, had strained a point to be present at such an important contest,
no doubt anticipating that the winner would insist upon his “crowning”
him upon the spot; but in this the “mad priest” was disappointed: his
services were not required, and he had to return to town after the battle,
without being called upon to distinguish himself in any manner except in
the voracious devouring of the contents of a huge sandwich-box, which he
was compelled to attack by the calls of appetite, and in the ceremony of
swallowing which he highly distinguished himself. At length the train
was full, the station-doors were closed, and at half-past eight precisely the
whistle sounded, and we were off. The caravan, consisting of some sixteen
carriages, all of which were crammed, proceeded steadily on its way until
we reached Bishop Stortford, where we took in Orme (for the fight), and
water (for the engine). The next stoppage was Elsenham, where Broome
got into the train, and the engineer received his orders as to the final destination.
He, acting under directions, pulled up at Ely, where a pilot, who
had gone on the previous day, took up his position on the train, and
informed us of that of which we had already our misgivings&mdash;&#8203;<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, that an
immense number of persons had gone by parliamentary train from London
to Mildenhall, early in the morning, and were there in waiting to receive
the combatants and their friends. This being the case, proved the correctness
of the precautions we had taken in sending on a pilot beforehand.
<a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a><span class="pageno">332</span>
That gentleman now undertook to conduct us to a spot where business
could be proceeded with in peace and comfort, and the train once again
sped on its way. As we passed Mildenhall, we saw hundreds of disappointed
travellers, who had been patiently waiting all the morning, and
who were thus, very properly, baulked in their parsimonious intentions.
At Lakenheath, the next station, we perceived a company of mounted
blues in readiness to spoil sport. These worthies, like the would-be spectators
at Mildenhall, also had their trouble and expense for nothing.
There was no intention of breaking the peace within their bailiwick, so
still the train went on. At length the appointed spot was reached, between
two stations, and about 108 miles from London. Here a hasty debarkation
was effected, and the train returned to the nearest station. Tom Oliver,
his son, and Tom Callas, at once proceeded to erect the lists, while Dan
Dismore carried on a brisk business in the sale of inner-ring tickets. Some
idea of the number of gentlemen present may be gathered from the fact
that the tickets so disposed of realised between £40 and £50. There were,
of course, a great number of outsiders on the ground, but owing to the
precautions that had been taken in keeping things dark, the total number
of spectators did not exceed 2,000. All these persons, by the admirable
arrangements, and the activity of the ring-keepers of the Pugilistic Association,
obtained an admirable view of the contest throughout, and we did
not, during the day, hear of a single disturbance calculated in the slightest
degree to interfere with the sport, or those anxious to witness it. By a
quarter-past one o’clock the ring was completed. Orme immediately
pitched his castor within the ropes, and followed himself, attended by Tom
Sayers and Jack Grant. He looked well and hardy, and wore a smile of
confidence on his good-humoured mug. In about ten minutes more the
other Harry made his appearance, closely followed by Bill Hayman, of
Birmingham, and Callaghan, of Derby, his brother Johnny being, as he
had promised, “in the corner.” Harry smiled, and shook hands with
t’other Harry, and both were loudly cheered. The ceremony of peeling
now commenced, and by half-past one the men were delivered at the
scratch in fighting undress.</p>

<p>On toeing the scratch, there was a very perceptible difference in the
appearance of the men. Broome overtopped his adversary a good two
inches, and was proportionably longer in reach. His weight, we are told,
did not exceed 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 5<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, but of this he might well have spared half a stone.
There was much loose flesh about his back, chest, and ribs, and although
<a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a><span class="pageno">333</span>
he was evidently in rude health, he had not been drawn fine enough to
stand a long day’s work under such a burning sun as shone down upon the
combatants during the fight. Broome, had he been permitted to take that
pains with himself requisite to make him fit, would have been about as
awkward a customer as could have been well conceived. As it was, however,
he was so much harassed with law and other proceedings that he
could not pay that attention to his training that he otherwise would have
done. We think at 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> his condition would be about perfection.
His attitude, as he stood awaiting the attack, was admirable, and, had it not
been for his fat, he would have looked all over a gladiator. Orme, whose
colour is almost mahogany, is barely 5<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> 8<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> in height, but is a thick-set,
powerful fellow, with a frame of iron, long arms, a perfect bull-neck, and
a pair of understandings fit for an Atlas. His weight was 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, and
of this scarcely 2<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> was superfluous stuff. His attitude, when on the
defensive, is not graceful, but he looks rough and ready, his dangerous
right being across his mark, but always ready to be dashed out at the least
opening on his adversary’s ribs. It was clear that there was a determination
on both sides “to do or die,” and the spectators made up their minds
that they were in for a good thing. Before the men entered the ring, the
betting was 6 and 7 to 4 on Broome, but these odds were, previous to the
fight, increased to 2 to 1, at which price a good deal of business was done.
The colours having been duly tied to the stakes (blue and white spot for
Broome, green, with small white rings thereon for Orme), the signal was
given that all was in readiness, and “time” was called.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, after one or two feints,
approached his man and attempted to draw
him, but Orme was wary, and stepped back.
They both then advanced and retreated
several times, Broome repeatedly making attempts
to kid his man within reach, but
Orme was too wary. Broome scratched his
ear, as endeavouring to rouse an idea what to
do next, when Orme approached and lunged
out heavily with his right out of distance;
Broome then let fly both hands, but was
neatly stopped. Orme now went up to his
man and sent out both mauleys, but Broome
jumped away. More sparring and fiddling,
Orme several times stopping Broome’s left.
At length Broome crept close again, lunged
out one, two&mdash;&#8203;his left was stopped, but his
right just reached the left side of Orme’s
nut; Orme returned very heavily with his
right on the ribs, and after receiving a gentle
tap on the forehead from Broome’s left, the
latter closed, and both rolled over. This
round lasted eight minutes, and at once
showed to the spectators that Orme was
much better on his legs and cleverer at stopping
than the public had given him credit
for.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Again did each man make ineffectual
feints out of distance. Broome at length
let go his left, but Orme jumped cleverly
away. Broome tried it again, but was stopped.
“There’s luck in odd numbers,” however,
for, in a third attempt, he got home
heavily on Orme’s left peeper, and then on
his mouth, and, on Orme rushing at him
to make a return, Broome turned his back
and ran round the ring. They quickly got
together again, when, after one or two very
slight exchanges, Orme got down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, on nearing his man, led off
with his left, and reached Orme’s kissing-trap.
Sharp counter-hits followed, Orme
<a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a><span class="pageno">334</span>
reaching Broome’s left ogle with his right,
and Broome getting heavily home on Orme’s
right eye. A few weaving half-arm hits followed
to a close, and both were down, Orme
under.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Broome feinted with his left, but it
was no go. At length he succeeded in drawing
Orme, who rattled at him, when Broome
propped him heavily on the left peeper,
drawing “first blood” from a cut on the
brow. Some heavy exchanges followed, Orme
delivering his right with terrific force on
Broome’s ribs three times, and receiving
heavy spanks in return on his right ogle and
mouth, drawing more claret, and in the end,
as Orme lunged out with his right, his head
came forward, and Broome administered a
terrific upper-cut in the mark, which doubled
him up completely. Orme turned round, and
gradually fell to the ground. It was now
thought to be all over, but Orme, being in
good condition, quickly rallied.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Orme, on coming up, showed marks of
Broome’s visitations on his right peeper,
which was beginning to close, while the
marks on Broome’s ribs proved that Orme’s
right had done him good service in that quarter.
Broome dodged his man, and on Orme
poking his head forwards, instantly dashed
in his left on the dexter optic. He tried to
repeat it, but was stopped. Both now let
fly out of distance, crept close, and Broome
made his one, two, on the right eye and side
of Orme’s canister. Orme returned with
severity on the ribs, and then on Broome’s
mouth. A pause ensued, during which
Broome put down his hands. On lifting
them again he approached Orme, planted
one hand on the forehead, and the other on
the left lug, and cleverly jumped away from
Orme’s return. Broome made two attempts
to repeat the dose, but Orme got quickly
away. Orme now took a turn, swung out
his right heavily on the ribs, and got away.
Long sparring followed, during which the
perspiration came from Broome’s every pore&mdash;&#8203;the
sun was insufferably hot for the time
of year, and must have been distressing to
both men. Caution was now the order of the
day, until Broome got within distance, when
he sent out his left and caught Orme on the
right eye, but not heavily; this he repeated,
when Orme again swung out his right, catching
Broome heavily on the ribs, and jumped
away. Some wild hitting out of distance
succeeded, but, on their getting steadier,
Broome let go his left spank in Orme’s
mouth, and jumped away; again he crept
close, made his one, two heavily on the left
and right cheek, drawing claret from the
latter. On Orme attempting to rush in,
Broome again turned tail and ran across the
ring. Orme followed him up, when Broome
jumped quickly round and delivered his left
heavily on the right cheek. Orme countered
him heavily on the mazzard&mdash;&#8203;received
another spank on the right cheek, when
Broome once more turned his back and retreated.
Long sparring for wind now took
place, after which there was some mutual
stopping. Broome, at length caught Orme
sharply on the mouth and right cheek,
which brought them to a rally, in which
Orme’s right was excessively busy on
Broome’s ribs, while the returns of Broome
did no execution. The repeated “thuds”
on his ribs made Broome wince, and screw
himself up, evidently with pain; he retired,
blowing, while Orme (instead of following
him up) stood in the middle of the ring until
Broome recovered himself. The latter
now popped in his left on the right cheek,
but Orme countered him with the left heavily
on the nozzle, drawing claret from a cut
on the bridge of that organ, which, in Harry,
as well as Johnny Broome, is slightly of the
Roman order. Orme also caught Broome
another spank on the ribs with his right,
which led to heavy exchanges, in the course
of which Broome reached Orme’s mouth and
right cheek, while the latter caught Broome
a tremendous hit on the left eyebrow, with
his right, inflicting a deep, perpendicular cut,
and drawing the ruby in profusion. Broome
retired, and wiped away the fluid as it ran
into his ogle, Orme again refusing to profit
by opportunity, and go in while his man was
confused. Broome soon recovered his presence
of mind, went at his man, and, after
some rattling exchanges, Orme was down,
amidst the vociferous cheers of his friends,
who considered that in this round he had
infinitely the best of the hitting. It was a
tremendous round, lasting sixteen minutes,
during the greater part of which time the
hitting was extremely severe.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Both came up puffing, and their countenances
considerably changed since the last
round. After a good deal of sparring out of
distance, Broome opened the ball, just reaching
Orme’s nose with his left. A second
attempt was frustrated by Orme jumping
away and lunging out his right most viciously
at the body; luckily, however, for the Champion,
it did not reach him, or it would most
assuredly have “found him at home.” Broome
again crept up, caught Orme on the potato-trap
with his left, but was prettily stopped
in a second attempt. He tried once more,
reached Orme’s left whisker-bed, but napped
it heavily on the sore spot, his left eyebrow,
from which a fresh tap was instantly opened.
Broome retreated to wipe away the carmine
from his peeper, and as Orme attempted to
follow him up, he met him with a straight
shooter on the mouth, which opened up
another spring. This caused Orme to rush in
wildly, when he caught it severely on the
smeller, from which more claret trickled;
Broome then closed, and, after a long
struggle, threw and fell heavily on Orme.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Broome led off with his left, but was
neatly stopped; he tried again left and right,
and was again parried, Orme returning a
stinger with his right on the left eye. Orme
now took the initiative, dashed in regardless
<a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a><span class="pageno">335</span>
of consequences, and was propped heavily on
the left eye. This led to tremendous
counter-hits with the left, each getting well
home on his opponent’s smelling-bottle. A
ding-dong rally followed, both getting it
severely on the mouth and nose, left and
right, and Orme punching Broome’s ribs with
great severity. At length they closed, and
rolled over together, Orme under.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Both came up much the worse for
wear. They sparred cautiously for wind,
until Broome got close and sent out his left,
which Orme parried, and missed his return.
Broome led off twice in succession; the first
time Orme jumped away, but the second
Broome paid a visit to his right cheek.
Orme then made his left on the chest,
Broome returning with both hands on the
side of his opponent’s nut and his right
cheek-bone. Two more attempts were
cleverly stopped by Orme, after which they
rested a short time. Broome was first to recommence,
caught Orme on the left cheek,
and received another awkward reminder on
the left eyebrow from Orme’s right sledge-hammer.
Heavy exchanges followed, Orme
getting well home on Broome’s mug and
nose, and Broome on the right ogle and
mouth. Broome now resorted to his old
system of turning his back and running
away, Orme after him. Broome at length
turned round, let out his left, but was
countered heavily on the nozzle and mouth.
Heavy hits were now exchanged, left and
right, and in the end Orme caught Broome
full on the point of his conk, drawing the
ruby in profusion, and knocking the Champion
off his legs; “first knock-down” being
awarded to Orme amidst vociferous cheering.
This round, which, like the fifth, was extremely
severe, lasted twelve minutes.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Broome came up snuffling; the crack
on his snuff-box in the last round had
evidently been a teazer. His left eye was
fast closing, and the hopes of the East
Enders began to be in the ascendant. The
betting receded almost to even money, and
it was clear Broome had made the discovery
that his adversary was no such catch as people
had expected. He, nevertheless, opened
the proceedings by dashing out his left,
which was well stopped. Counter-hits followed,
Broome reaching his opponent’s left
cheek, and receiving in return on the mouth.
Broome next made play left and right,
caught the gallant Orme heavily on each
cheek, and then, closing, threw and fell on
him. (One hour had now elapsed.)</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Broome once more took the lead, but
was prettily stopped. Heavy counter-hits
followed, Broome on the nose and Orme on
the left cheek. A close at the ropes succeeded,
when Broome hugged Orme round
the neck. Orme, however, punched away at
his ribs until Broome released him, and
Orme retreated to the centre of the ring,
whither Broome followed him, and some
heavy exchanges took place, Orme reaching
Broome’s nose and left peeper, and Broome
punishing him severely on the mouth. In
the end Orme got down.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, first to open the ball, caught
Orme sharply on the ivory box with his left,
drawing claret and loosening several of his
head rails. Orme would not be stalled off,
but immediately rattled in, when some
heavy counter-hitting took place, each getting
it severely on the nose and mouth. A
break away and at it again. The hitting in
this round was really tremendous, both men
staggering away after the counters, and each
having his cork drawn to some purpose. At
length they closed, and after a slight struggle
Orme got down.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, in coming up, looked weak
and distressed. Orme was also by no means
in good order; both his cheeks were considerably
swollen, and his mouth was
“reethur” out of shape. Orme led off, but
was well stopped. A second attempt from
his right reached Broome’s ribs very heavily,
and caused the latter to wince like a galled
horse. He quickly got over it, however, and
dashed out his left on Orme’s mouth.
He tried again, but Orme stepped back,
propping Master Broome on the sneezer
with his left as he came in. Exchanges followed,
Orme inflicting a fresh cut under
Broome’s left peeper, and receiving sharply
on his damaged kissing trap. In the end
Orme got down to avoid the fall.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, after a little cautious sparring,
let go his left and right, but was short,
and Orme immediately returned on his right
peeper; Broome retreated, and as Orme
came after him Broome sent out his left on
the mouth again, drawing the cork freely.
Broome now made two attempts to get in
his one, two, but on each occasion Orme was
too quick for him, and jumped away. In a
third attempt he reached Orme’s smeller, a
heavy nose-ender, which again tapped his
best October. He repeated the dose on the
mug, whereupon Orme dashed in, caught
him on the left cheek with his right, closed,
and, after a short struggle, both were down.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Orme feinted with his left, and then
dashed in his right on Broome’s left ogle, a
very heavy hit. Broome returned on the
mouth, and then retreated; some sparring
at a distance followed, and on their again
getting close, Broome sent out both mawleys,
but was cleverly stopped. Orme then
popped in his left on the right cheek, and
Broome, in getting away from further visitations,
fell through the ropes.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Both slow to the call of “time,” and
on reaching the scratch they stood and looked
at each other until Orme advanced, when
Broome tried to meet him with his left, but
Orme stopped him neatly twice, and at a
third attempt jumped away. Orme then
again crept in and made his right tell heavily
on the ribs. Broome now sent home his left
and right on the left ogle and nose of Orme,
repeated the dose on the nose and mouth
<a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a><span class="pageno">336</span>
heavily, and as Orme dashed in with his
right on the ribs, Broome caught him a tremendous
upper-cut on the mark with his
right, and Orme fell.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Orme, on coming up, appeared to have
suffered severely from the upper-cut in the
last round; he was evidently much shaken,
in addition to which both his eyes were gradually
going. He nevertheless tried to lead
off left and right, but his blows wanted
power. Broome returned on the left cheek,
and then on the mouth, Orme’s return being
out of distance. Orme still persevered, but
got propped heavily on the nose from
Broome’s left. Broome at length closed,
when Orme punched him heavily on the
ribs, but Broome succeeded in throwing and
falling heavily on him.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Orme led off left and right, but was
stopped; he then rushed in, and was
propped heavily on the nose, and got down.
(Time, one hour and a half.)</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Broome rattled in left and right on
the ogles of Orme, and got away. Orme
followed him up, reached his chest with the
left, and was propped heavily on the left
cheek. Broome closed, and catching Orme
round the neck, hugged him until Orme
dropped on his knees. Orme then put his
hands round Broome’s thigh, but Broome
got away, and walked to his corner. A claim
of “foul” was made on the part of Broome,
on the ground that he (Orme) had attempted
to pull him over by catching him below the
waistband. The claim, however, was not
allowed, the referee believing that Orme
was utterly unaware as to where he had
caught hold of Broome.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Broome again led off left and right,
reaching Orme’s cheek and mouth heavily.
A close, and some in-fighting in favour of
Broome, followed by a break-away, and at
it again, Broome delivering heavily on Orme’s
nose and eyes, and drawing claret from several
bottles. In the end Broome closed, and
threw his man again, making the unpleasant
addition of his own weight.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Both long in answering to the call
of time, but Broome first up. On getting
close Orme caught Broome on the ribs, and
was countered sharply on the nose. Broome
then took the lead, and planted on his right
cheek heavily. This brought them to some
sharp exchanges in favour of Broome. In
the end, Orme got down on his knees, and
Broome caught him on the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">os frontis</span> with his
left while in that position. A claim of “foul”
was now made by Orme’s friends, but it was
clear Broome’s blow had started before Orme
reached the ground, and could not have been
withheld. The decision was again “fair,”
and the mill proceeded.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, after one or two feints, let
go his left, reaching Orme’s snuff-box with
effect; slight exchanges ensued, and Orme
again got down weak.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, seeing his man was much
shaken, at once went to work, caught Orme
heavily on the left cheek, and closed at the
ropes, where he hung on Orme; the latter
pegged away at Broome’s ribs until he let
him go, and Orme then planted his right
heavily on Broome’s left cheek. Tremendous
exchanges followed, each staggering
from the effects of the blows, Broome reaching
Orme’s left eye and nose, and he receiving
on the left peeper and ribs. Broome then
stepped back, and as Orme came again caught
him heavily on the left ogle, and Orme fell.
Both were now much distressed, and lay on
their backs on the ground until time was
called.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Orme was the first at the scratch,
and attempted to lead off, but Broome got
cleverly away, and then went at his man,
delivering both hands on the mouth and
nose heavily, and jumped easily away from
Orme’s returns, which were sadly out of distance.
Orme, however, followed him up,
and although Harry met him full on the
snout, he planted his dangerous right on the
ribs with astonishing effect. Harry then
reached Orme’s sinister peeper heavily, drawing
more of the Falernian, and finally shut
up the shop. Rattling exchanges followed,
Broome getting well home on the mouth,
and receiving a slogging right-hander on the
jaw, from the effects of which he staggered
back and fell in his corner.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Orme came up almost blind, but still
he persevered; he feinted, and tried to get
on to Broome, who stepped cleverly away,
and waited for the attack. Orme did not
keep him long in suspense, but dashed out
left and right; the former was stopped, but
the latter reached Broome’s damaged peeper,
drawing more blood. Broome, however, by
way of retaliation, cross-countered him on
the nose heavily, again drawing a crimson
stream. Broome now walked to his corner,
took a sponge and wiped his eye, and went
at it again, caught Orme heavily on the
point of the nose with his left, and Orme
dropped on his knees, Broome again catching
him a snorter just as he reached <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</span>,
giving rise to another appeal, which was not
allowed.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Caution the order of the day, both
evidently tired. Orme at last led off, and
caught Broome with his right on the side of
his cranium, on which Broome closed, and
Orme immediately got down.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Orme led off with his left, but was
short. Broome quickly returned one, two,
on his left cheek and mug, and got away
from Orme’s return. Orme persevered and
bored in, but Broome hit him straight on the
cheek, Orme being again out of distance
with his returns. At last he reached Broome’s
ribs with a heavy right-hander, and Broome
returned on the mouth. Both now retired
to their corners, and permitted their seconds
to wipe their phisogs for them, and took a
pull of “Adam’s ale,” after which refreshing
ceremony they once more returned to
the scratch, and Broome let fly his left on
<a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a><span class="pageno">337</span>
Orme’s left cheek, closed, and after a short
struggle both were down. (Two hours had
now expired.)</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Broome set a good example by dashing
out his left on Orme’s right cheek, which
led to light exchanges at the ropes. Orme
then walked to the middle of the ring,
whither Broome followed, gave him a spank
in the left eye, and walked away. He again
approached his man, caught him heavily on
the mouth, and in return received another
rib-bender from Orme’s right. Broome now
made his right tell on Orme’s ribs, and in
getting away from the return fell.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Orme, although almost in darkness,
led off with his right on the ribs&mdash;&#8203;he attempted
a repetition, but Broome caught him
heavily on the mouth and then on the nose.
After some slight exchanges in favour of
Broome, they again retired to their corners
and had a rest, and came at it again; Orme
was receiver-general, and in the end got
down.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;Orme again led off, but was well
stopped; he tried it yet once more, but
from the style of his hitting it was pretty
clear he could scarcely see his adversary.
He, however, reached Broome’s ribs heavily
after one or two attempts, and Broome
missed a well-intended upper-cut in return.
The latter, however, soon approached his
now fast-sinking adversary, delivered his
left and right heavily on Orme’s left ogle
and smeller, drawing a fresh supply of claret
from the latter, and knocking his man
down.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;Orme came up very groggy and wild,
but determined; he led off with his right,
but Broome laughingly stepped on one side;
he tried again but was stopped, and received
heavily on the left eye and mouth, and was
again knocked down. His backers and
seconds, seeing that it was useless to prolong
the contest, wished to throw up the sponge,
but the gallant fellow would not hear of it,
and he laid on his back until time was called,
when he again went to the scratch for the</p>

<p>     31st and last round.&mdash;&#8203;It was evident that
he came up only to receive, and that he was
struggling against nature; he was all but
blind, and tremendously punished about the
head, but was still tolerably strong on his
pins. He led off wildly, but of course was
out of distance. Broome then went to him,
administered the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grâce</span>, in the shape
of a gentle tap on the nose, and the brave
fellow went to earth almost insensible. Tom
Sayers now threw up the sponge, and Harry
Broome was proclaimed the victor, and still
Champion of England, amidst the vociferous
cheers of his friends. The battle lasted exactly
<em>two hours and eighteen minutes</em>. All
being over, all at once made for the station
to which the train had been removed, the
vanquished man being conveyed there on a
truck. The only personage left behind on
the ground was Jem Burn, who, being still
a martyr to the gout, declined attempting
to walk a good mile along the railway to the
station, and intimated his intention of remaining
on the field of battle all night.
All necessity for his imposing on himself
such a penalty as this was, however, avoided
by the engineer taking the engine and
tender which had been attached to the
train down the line to the place where “my
nevvy” was located, and bringing him up,
sitting on a heap of coke, to the door of the
carriage in which his patrons were already
seated. All now quickly ensconced themselves
in the train, and the homeward
journey was commenced about half-past
four o’clock, and the Metropolis was reached
about eight o’clock, after many stoppages.
On the homeward passage a collection was
made for the game and resolute Orme,
which reached the handsome sum of £22,
and this was considerably increased at the
giving up of the stakes.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;This battle took everybody
by surprise. On the one hand, there had
been continual rumours that Broome never
intended fighting, that he could not possibly
get himself anywhere near fit, and that the
match would end in a juggle. On the other,
it was asserted that Orme had overreached
himself, and was flying at too high game;
that he would never be able to reach Harry
Broome, and must be beaten in half an hour.
Our readers will perceive, by the foregoing
account, that the “croakers” were far from
the mark. The fight was the best we have
had for years between two big men. Broome
has lost none of his scientific acquirements.
He is a good straight hitter, clever at
stopping, an excellent wrestler, and quick
on his pins. He is, however, remarkably
awkward in getting away when in difficulty&mdash;&#8203;instead
of jumping back, as we are accustomed
to see others do, he turns his back
and runs, leaving himself open to severe
punishment from a cleverer tactician than
Orme. Although he was much out of condition,
and was hit very hard, both in the
ribs and on the frontispiece, and several
times was in great difficulties, he persevered
most gamely throughout, and took his punishment
like a thorough glutton. Should he
make another match, he ought to commence
training much earlier than he did on the
present occasion, and reduce himself certainly
to 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, which is the outside
weight at which he ought to fight. If he
does this, we think, looking at the way in
which he fought on Monday, he will prove
himself a tough customer to all comers, and
the man who wrests the laurels of the
Championship from him will have reason to
be proud of his achievement. Orme, since
his last battle with Aaron Jones, has wonderfully
improved in science and quickness.
On Monday, for a considerable length of
time, Broome found it exceedingly difficult
to get on to him; he could stop well, get
away sharply, and, directly he saw an opening,
was ready with his dangerous right,
<a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a><span class="pageno">338</span>
which, as will be seen above, proved a
dreadful teaser to the flesh-covered ribs of
Broome. We consider him to be the severest
hitter of the present day, and did he but
understand leading off with his left, instead
of giving his head, as he must necessarily
do when he makes play with his right, would
be “hard to beat.” The knock-down blow
on Broome’s nose and jaw, and one or two
of the punches in the ribs, administered
early in the fight, were of such a nature as
for the time to reduce Broome to a standstill,
and had Orme only possessed the
requisite skill to follow up his advantage,
things might have presented a very serious
aspect as regarded Broome’s chance of
winning. By saying that Orme did not
possess skill, we do not for an instant impute
to him a want of ordinary boxing capability,
but a want of tact in knowing when
to “force the pace,” and prevent his opponent
recovering wind and strength. Had
Orme been capable of pursuing that system,
the result might have been “a horse of
another colour.” This only applies to the
earlier part of the contest. After the upper-cut
administered on the mark in the 15th
round, a great deal of the steel was taken
out of Orme, and we are informed that he
felt sick during the remainder of the fight,
while Broome slowly, but surely, improved
his position. Although Orme now and then
got again on the damaged ogle and ribs,
Broome almost invariably met him on the
eyes and mouth, gradually reducing his
chance, until, in the last round, he was
completely blind, and nature had deserted
him. Some remarks were made on the
novelty of the men retiring to their corners,
and “taking a drink” during the rounds.
We do not recollect ever witnessing a similar
scene before; but the want of condition on
the part of Broome, combined with the heat
of the day, was a very good excuse for his
adopting such a plan, and as it was resorted
to by one, there could, of course, be no
reason why the example should not be
followed by the other. The battle, from
first to last, was a manly, upright struggle
for pre-eminence&mdash;&#8203;neither man attempted to
take an unworthy advantage&mdash;&#8203;and had it not
been for the ridiculous appeals made by the
seconds on each side, would have been a
model mill in every sense of the word. Such
a fight for the Championship has not been
seen for very many years.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Once again the Old Tipton made public his “grievance,” declaring that the
award of “foul” in their former encounter had deprived him of the honour of
the belt and the profit of the stakes, and that the bold Harry held the Championship
by “a fluke.” Harry accepted his offer, and articles were entered
into, but when £25 were posted, Broome forfeited the money down; his
plea being that he had an engagement with Aaron Jones (this went off),
and another with Paddock. Forfeits seem to have been in fashion in
1855. On February 20th, 1855, Harry Broome forfeited £180 to Tom
Paddock, and on March 12th, £10 to the same. In March, 1856, the
Tipton received £70 forfeit from Aaron Jones; and on October 2nd, 1856,
he also received £80 forfeit from Tom Paddock. Pleasant times for the
<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</span> backers of men!</p>

<p>It would have been well for Broome’s fame had his hard-won victory
over the gallant Harry Orme been the closing scene of his Ring career;
his increasing bulk, as was evident to all who knew him, forbade the
absolutely necessary reduction of weight which must precede anything like
fitness for a pugilistic contest of a prolonged and severe character. Not
so, however, thought Harry Broome. On the 12th of December, 1855,
he signed articles with Tom Paddock, for £200 a side, for a meeting
on May 19th, 1856, and on that day experienced his final defeat, of
which the full details will be found in the Memoir of <span class="sc">Paddock</span> in our
preceding chapter (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 294&ndash;303).
</p>
<a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a><span class="pageno">339</span>

<p>From this time forth Harry fell out of the rank of claimants for the
“blue riband” of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, leaving the struggle for supremacy to
Paddock, Aaron Jones, the Tipton Slasher, and the little pugilistic phenomenon
of 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 12<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> who successively beat all three of them, and whose
exploits form the subject of our next chapter.</p>

<p>Harry left London in 1856, and became the landlord of the Albion
Tavern, in Warblington Street, Portsmouth, which was soon famous as
a sporting rendezvous. From this house he backed several good men, the
best known of whom was the unlucky Bill Bainge, or Benjamin, who as
“Broome’s Novice” was twice unsuccessfully brought out to check the
upward and onward career of Tom Sayers to the eminence of the
Championship. For a few years following Harry was a public caterer and
attendant at the principal race-meetings. The last time we met him in
the flesh&mdash;&#8203;and he had then too much of it&mdash;&#8203;was at Epsom in 1865, in
Gladiateur’s year, when, in reply to an inquiry after his health and
prospects, he told us he was “in charge” of the Count Lagrange’s invaluable
horse; we suspect as a “watcher,” for which he was formidably
well qualified, physically as well as mentally. He was, however, aptly
described by a friend as “all to pieces,” and this was shown by his death,
which soon followed, on the 2nd of November in the above-named year,
at the early age of 39 years.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_27" id="fnanchor_27"></a><a href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span>

 It may interest some readers to know that we are indebted to Harry Broome’s early
opponent, Joe Rowe, for the original of the portrait which faces the first page of this
memoir. In our search after authentic likenesses, we learned that “Joe” still flourished
as the proprietor of a cigar and tobacco store in Sun Street, Finsbury. Thither we bent our
steps, and there we found a pleasant-spoken and young-looking specimen of the fair sex,
who, in answer to our inquiries, announced herself as Mrs. Rowe. Our first impression
was that we had chanced upon “Young Joe’s” bride; but no, it was the spouse of “Old
Joe,” who was “kicking up behind and before,” and in his sixty-second year is proprietor
of the lady and the “Sultan Cigar Stores.” A shake of the hand and a recognition, a
smoke, and a “liquor-up,” renewed acquaintance; and as Joe has a portfolio of “sporting
celebrities,” he cheerfully placed them at our disposal, for which we thus record our
thanks.

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Of</span> the numerous pugilistic pretenders who did battle during the years
comprised between the Championships of Bendigo and that of Harry
Broome, few deserve the honour of a separate memoir, or even of a recapitulation
of their battles. The best of the fights, indeed, may be safely credited
to the middle and light-weight men, who were, by their class, excluded from
competing with the big ones for the Championship.</p>

<p>Of these, Hammer Lane, Jem Wharton (Young Molyneaux), Johnny
Broome, Johnny Hannan, Owen Swift, Ned Adams, Mike Madden, Bill
Hayes, Donnelly, and others, will be found in the Author’s “Recollections
of the Ring,” to which the reader is referred. Here it is proposed to insert,
with a brief notice, the best battle of such heavy-weights as appear in these
pages as the antagonists of the men whose biographies are included in this

YOUNG LANGAN, of Liverpool, for £100.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">In the Memoir of <span class="sc">Caunt</span> (<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span> <a href="#Page_60"><abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 60&ndash;69</a>) will be found the details of
Brassey’s gallant contest with the gigantic Champion, October 26th, 1840.
That John Leechman had fair pretentions to be selected by his patrons to
do battle with “Big Ben,” the subjoined account of his fight with
Young Langan, of Liverpool, in the October of the previous year, will
show.</p>

<p>John Leechman, whose height was six feet, and weight 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>,
was born at Bradford, in Yorkshire, on the 1st of January, 1815. His
first battle, recorded in “Fistiana,” was in 1831, when, at the age of 16,
he defeated one Thomas Hartley, at Eccles Moor, near Leeds, after a tough
<a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a><span class="pageno">341</span>
fight of an hour and a quarter. On August 24th, in the same year, he took
the same time to batter one Ned Batterson, in 72 rounds. He then fought,
at Harpurhey, near Manchester, in May, 1833, Young Winterflood, of
Nottingham, for an hour, when the affair ended in a wrangle. Brassey
next met the well-known Jem Bailey, at Baildon Moor, and beat him, on
the 24th of April, 1835, in 74 rounds, occupying 2 hours and a quarter;
Brassey being at the same time sadly out of condition. Tom Scrutton was
also disposed of in 20 minutes, 17 rounds, on January 11th, 1836; and
this brings us to Brassey’s battle with the eccentric Bendigo. In the
memoir of that boxer (<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_7">7</a>, <a href="#Page_8">8</a>), will be found the particulars of that
defeat, which took place near Sheffield, on the 24th of May, 1836.
Brassey’s former antagonist, Jem Bailey, now came out, and demanded a
second trial, to which Brassey assented, and the men met at Hales Green,
near Pulham, Norfolk. Although Brassey had won the fight in the
71st round, through the indecision or misconduct of the referee,
Bailey’s backers raised a dispute, sued the stakeholder, and recovered back
their money. We now come to the battle with Young Langan, of Liverpool,
which, except his defeat by Tass Parker, is Brassey’s only fight
worth preserving.</p>

<p>This contest, which was decided on the 8th of October, 1839, at Woodhead,
in Cheshire, excited an unusual degree of interest, not only among the
friends of each man, but throughout all sporting circles in Yorkshire, Lancashire
and the Midlands. Brassey was trained near Norwich, under the
personal superintendence of the veteran Ned Painter, who accompanied
his pupil to the scene of action. Langan took his exercise at Bootle,
near Liverpool, in company with Tommy Britton, and his condition was
pronounced “perfect.” The ring was formed by the Liverpool Commissary,
and at 25 minutes past one Brassey, accompanied by Bill Hall, and
Gregson Green, the “sporting sweep,” as seconds, threw in his hat, and
was quickly followed by Young Langan, amidst loud cheering from the
Liverpool contingent. The day was magnificent, the sun shining with
splendour, and as Langan lost the toss for corners, Brassey was placed with
his face to the north. Each man was near upon 13 stone, but Brassey
was a little the taller. An objection having been taken to the length of
the spikes in Langan’s shoes, “the Morocco Prince,” who acted as his
second, condescended to waive his dignity, and a file being procured, he sat
down, and in a most workmanlike style reduced the sharp projections to
the dimensions of “sparrowbills.” Again some delay took place in the
<a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a><span class="pageno">342</span>
selection of a referee; this point settled, the men stripped for action. The
colours, an orange bandanna for Brassey, and a green and yellow for
Langan, being knotted to the stake, at 23 minutes past two the men
shook hands and stood up for</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Each advanced to the scratch,
Langan cool and smiling, Brassey looking
serious and earnest. After slight manœuvring,
Langan tried his left, and caught his
opponent upon the mug. Brassey was impetuous,
as if his anxiety was outstripping
his prudence. He looked sternly at his antagonist,
let fly, and planted two successive
right-handers upon Langan’s frontispiece&mdash;&#8203;one
upon the left eye, and the other on the
potato-trap; a close, and both down. Upon
Langan’s rising “first blood” was claimed
for Brassey, which was perceptible upon Langan’s
mouth.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Langan still wore a good-natured
smile, while Brassey appeared serious, and
the eagerness which he displayed was checked
by several of his friends, who saw that although
“his soul was in arms and eager for
the fray,” yet a little more of “the better
part of valour&mdash;&#8203;discretion,” might prevent
an accident. A little sparring&mdash;&#8203;Brassey
using his arms <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Bendigo</span>. Closer and
closer went the men, and a few smart exchanges
took place, when they fell upon the
ropes; a brief struggle ensued, and both
went to the ground.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;No alteration of moment was to be
seen upon either of the men, except that
Langan’s left eye seemed rather inclined to
renounce the plebeian cast, and become “a
swell.” Langan held his right arm upon his
breast, and his left a little advanced; feints
from both, when Langan shot out with his
left, caught Brassey upon the pimple, and
sent him to grass. Brassey’s second objected
to this being considered a knock-down blow,
but the referee decided “first knock-down
blow” in favour of Langan.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Brassey came to the scratch with as
much eagerness as ever, and scowled upon
his rival. Langan was not dismayed, and
the smile of good-humour, before noticed,
assumed, for an instant, that of derision; he
was, however, cautious, and played about
actively. Brassey tried his right, was well
parried, ditto with his left, when Langan
receded a pace or two, and escaped a nasty
one for his nob. Langan tried his luck,
when a rapid bout of in-fighting ensued,
which terminated in Brassey’s being thrown.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Upon “time” being called, Langan
marched to the centre of the ring, and as
Brassey did not appear inclined to advance so
far, Langan pointed to the scratch, as much
as to say, “Come to the spot, my boy.”
Brassey kept his station, when Langan
“crossed the Rubicon,” and a long, dodging
round took place, each trying his left mauley
occasionally without effect, until they reached
a corner of the ring, when a slashing rally
followed&mdash;&#8203;Brassey down.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Brassey was now more quiet in his
demeanour, but still intent upon mischief;
in fact, had he not softened down the very
strong penchant for going in, which he evinced
during the five preceding rounds, it is questionable
whether his eagerness would not
have led him headlong into mischief. Each
man eyed the other with determination,
Langan tried his left, no go&mdash;&#8203;again, it would
not fit&mdash;&#8203;again he essayed, and caught Brassey
a good left-hander upon his dial, receiving
a straight left-handed one in return
upon his snuff-box. A quick rally, mutual
exchanges, when once more Brassey fell.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;The visit which Brassey had paid to
Langan’s snout was far from pleasant
and the claret flowed profusely; the left eye
also of the young Hibernian began to puff,
and increase beyond its natural dimensions.
Lengthened sparring. A close; Langan got
away; the men closed again, when some
severe blows from the right and left took
place, the punishment being about equal,
and in the struggle both went down, Langan
first on the floor.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;The concluding rally of the last round
had not been mere play, for each man’s
phisog bore <em>striking proofs</em> of handy work.
Brassey was cut over the right eyebrow, and
was bleeding copiously; and Langan’s left
was following suit, except that his wound
was under the eye, and his opponent’s over.
Extreme caution was now the password.
Sparring, and no attempt at a single blow
for nearly six minutes, which drew forth
some volleys of hisses at the tardiness of the
performers. Two minutes more elapsed, and
no inclination to go to work, when Langan
tried his left, missed, and caught a tremendous
left-hander upon his nut, which, we
fancy, suffered less than his assailant’s
knuckles, and Brassey slipped down.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Langan evidently wished to repay
Brassey for his kindness, and planted two
successive right-handers, one upon his weasand,
and the other upon his nob. (Loud
cheers for Langan.) A close, both down.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Sparring and manœuvring (5 to 4 on
Langan). Brassey looked daggers, made
a feint with his right, and made a lunge
with his left upon Langan’s body corporate.
Langan quickly tried a right-handed return,
<a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a><span class="pageno">343</span>
failed, immediately seconded his intention
with an effectual one, when some excellent
counters ensued, and Brassey went down.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;The men met, when Brassey dropped
his arms straight down, looked and nodded
to his opponent. Langan maintained his
position, and smiled (loud applause). Protracted
sparring. Dodging all round the
ring: another halt; more procrastination.
(“Go to work,” cried the Morocco Prince;
I’m tired of this sort of play.”) All was
of no avail, the men still continued sparring,
at last an indifferent rally ended suspense,
and Brassey was thrown. This round lasted
sixteen minutes and a half, and no real work
done.</p>

<p>     12 and 13.&mdash;&#8203;Mutual returns, with considerable
bodily exertion, both down in the
struggle.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Very slight variation from the two
last.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Counters. Brassey lunged out, and
gave Langan an effective muzzler, receiving
an excellent left-hander by way of “change,”
upon his brow, which set the crimson flowing.
Langan went to his antagonist, when
Brassey slipped and fell.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Langan’s lip began to swell, and the
gash under his left eye still emitted the
claret. Brassey’s first wound was quite dried
up, and a stranger might have pronounced
it three or four days old. After a little
sparring, Langan shot out with his left, and
fell from the over-reach of his own blow.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Give and take; Brassey down.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Langan was advancing to the scratch,
when some cowardly rascal pitched a clod at
him, which struck him on the hip, without
doing any damage. A tedious round, when
Brassey fell, escaping in his fall a right-handed
upper-cut from Langan’s bunch of
fives.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Hit for hit; when Langan, in striking
out, as Brassey jumped back, caught him
just below the belt with his right. An appeal,
but the referee decided the blow to be
unintentional, and consequently fair, and
the fight proceeded, Langan getting the worst
of the rally; both down.</p>

<p>     20, 21, 22, 23, 24.&mdash;&#8203;All in favour of Brassey.
A great uproar and confusion took
place in the last round, in the outer ring,
which threatened an interruption of the mill,
but, after some delay, the tumult was quelled,
and the spectators resumed their
stations.</p>

<p>     25 to 33.&mdash;&#8203;Each of these rounds were,
more or less, in favour of Brassey, although
he was invariably undermost.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Langan’s frontispiece was sadly
disfigured, whilst Brassey’s was tolerably
symmetrical. This may be accounted for
from the fact of Brassey’s flesh not swelling,
nor his wounds remaining fresh, but quickly
assuming the appearance of cuts of some
standing. From this to the 39th round,
Langan gradually lost ground, though he
never flinched from fairly meeting his man.</p>

<p>     40.&mdash;&#8203;Another uproar in the outer ring,
with the addition of a few heavy clods
flying about, the Liverpool party containing
some noisy members. The men proved
themselves good ’uns in reality, for they
paid no attention to the row, but kept to
their work, caught each other’s open left
hand, and delivered two terrific round
swinging right-handers upon each other’s
corpus. After some little fibbing Brassey
went down, and Langan rolled over him.</p>

<p>     41 to 44.&mdash;&#8203;Brassey was evidently gaining
ground, and in the latter round Langan
severely injured his right leg in falling
against a stake, which made him lame for
the remainder of the fight.</p>

<p>     45.&mdash;&#8203;Nothing material in this round, except
one dishonourable knave deliberately
cutting the rope of the inner ring, and had
it not been for the praiseworthy activity of
little Billy Critchley in splicing the same,
would doubtless have finished the mill with
a wrangle.</p>

<p>     46 to 51.&mdash;&#8203;Brassey’s friends were in transports.
Victory was now booked as certain,
and the rowdy upon Brassey could find
no takers.</p>

<p>     52.&mdash;&#8203;Langan rallied, and up to the 56th
round may be said at intervals to have
turned the tide in his own favour; nay, even
bets were loudly proclaimed, but little tin
was sported.</p>

<p>     57.&mdash;&#8203;Brassey was evidently at sea, and
the Langanites bawled most lustily. Compliment
for compliment, each party alternately
cheering on their man until Brassey
fell.</p>

<p>     58 to 62.&mdash;&#8203;Both men fought well and to
win. Brassey’s lower lip had received some
stingers from his opponent in the way of
cutting and carving, while Langan’s phisog
was quite the reverse of what Lavater would
term “the exquisite,” strongly reminding
us of Kenney Meadows’s “Gallery” portrait
of the “Man wot won the fight.”</p>

<p>     63.&mdash;&#8203;To all appearances it was now extremely
doubtful which would be the victor.
Hit for hit&mdash;&#8203;right and left&mdash;&#8203;give and take&mdash;&#8203;advance
and retreat, until both heroes fell
over the ropes and out of the ring.</p>

<p>     64.&mdash;&#8203;Brassey came up and lost no time
in drawing the claret from Langan’s right
peeper, but slipped down from exertion.</p>

<p>     65.&mdash;&#8203;Langan’s mug was awful, his left
ogle nearly closed, and he looked more languid
than in any round previously; this
and the 66th round told against him.</p>

<p>     67.&mdash;&#8203;One effort more; Brassey missed his
left, Langan grasped him, and with a vigorous
strength which we at this time thought
he did not possess, threw him heavily.</p>

<p>     68.&mdash;&#8203;From this to the 73rd round Langan
gradually continued losing, his left eye
being quite closed, his right much swollen,
and his lips as thick as those of Massa
Molyneaux; Brassey seemed recovered, and
was nearly as fresh as ever.</p>

<p>     74.&mdash;&#8203;Brassey, bent upon finishing as soon
<a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a><span class="pageno">344</span>
as possible, met his man, delivered his left,
then retreated, and as Langan stumbled
forward, delivered two tremendous right-handed
blows, which felled him to the
ground.</p>

<p>     75.&mdash;&#8203;Upon time being called, Langan was
deaf to the cry, and Brassey was pronounced
the conqueror after a protracted struggle of
<em>two hours and thirty-five minutes</em>.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;The instant the men had
peeled the disparity in height and length of
arm was apparent, which nothing short of
superior science and activity on the part of
Langan, which he certainly did not possess,
could have overcome. In science Brassey
is fully equal to Langan, while in lasting
power he is his superior. In the quality of
game Langan proved himself a hero; he
only gave in when nature left him powerless
to continue the contest. Brassey was
quickly himself, and walked to his carriage,
and Langan, though by far the most punished,
said, soon after, that he was fairly
beaten. Both men left the ground, as all
British boxers should, with no feeling of ill-will
towards each other.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>&mdash;&#8203;<span class="sc">TASS (HAZARD) PARKER, of West Bromwich, and
JOHN LEECHMAN (BRASSEY), of Bradford, for £100.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">After Brassey’s defeat by Caunt, already referred to, Tass Parker, of
West Bromwich, offered himself to the notice of Brassey, proposing to meet
him halfway between Bradford and West Bromwich, for £100. Parker,
(whose best fighting weight was 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>) at catch weight, and Brassey
not to exceed 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> on the day of fighting, which was fixed for
the 13th of July, 1841; a date which was subsequently extended to the
10th of August, on which day the men met at Brunt Lays, near Worksop,
under the circumstances and with the result we are now about to narrate.</p>

<p>Though the match was originally made in Manchester, the celebrity of
the men lent a metropolitan interest to the battle, and on the receipt
of a letter, dated the previous Friday, naming Lindrick Common, Notts,
near Eckington, on the borders of Yorkshire, as the rendezvous, the
writer booked himself, on the Monday, by the North Midland Rail for
Worksop. On arriving at that place he ascertained that Brassey was
already snugly ensconced at a small inn on the borders of Lindrick Common,
aforesaid, under the care of a liberal backer and Jemmy Wharton
(Young Molyneaux). Brassey was in high spirits and full of confidence,
yet we did not, upon a close scrutiny, consider him up to the mark, and
there was a feverishness in his pulse when we shook hands with him that induced
us to question the Black, whereon we were informed that he had
made an eccentric bolt from his training quarters a few days before,
and that otherwise he had not been strictly observant of the rigid
discipline indispensable to A 1 condition. Nevertheless his friends
not only declared him “all right,” but offered the odds of 6 to 4 in proof
of their good opinion. On the same night Parker arrived, accompanied by
Nick Ward, and by Jack Hunt, of Birmingham. He domiciled at the
<a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a><span class="pageno">345</span>
“Red Lion,” where we saw him on the following morning. He was in rude
health, his corpus as firm as collared brawn, and in expressing confidence
he was by no means more backward than his foe. The expediency of an
early meeting at the scene of action being admitted, it was agreed that
Brassey should go to scale at 10 o’clock, and that as soon as possible
afterwards operations should commence&mdash;&#8203;a prospect extremely agreeable
to some hundreds, who were desirous of returning the same day to the distant
localities from whence they had come, among whom we noticed
several Corinthians of “the upper crust,” and staunch supporters of the
fistic art.</p>

<p>Precisely at 10 o’clock we reached the Common, where an immense
multitude had already assembled, in every order of vehicle, and including
an extraordinary field of equestrians, who were, however, far out-numbered
by the muster of <em>toddlers</em>, a vast number of whom had devoted the night to
the exercise of their pedestrian powers. The scene was altogether most
animated, and rendered not the less so by a huntsman and a pack of foxhounds
taking their morning exercise in the distance. To all this, however,
there were drawbacks which threatened mischief; the first was the fact of
our having passed a body of the rural police for Nottinghamshire on their
march to the Common, and the next and more serious, the actual presence
of a worthy beak for the county of York, who, however loth, declared he
could not permit hostilities to take place within his jurisdiction. Thus
Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire were <em>tabooed</em>, but as Derbyshire, close
adjoining, was unrepresented, it was at once resolved to conduct the candidates
for milling fame to its hospitable meads. In the interim Brassey
was found to be as he should be in “pounds avoirdupois,” and a general
move to the “land of promise” took place. Of pilots there were abundance,
but, as it turned out, not equally happy in their knowledge of the
county; for while Parker and his friends took one road, Brassey and the
Commissary, with the ropes and stakes, took another. The latter led
through bridle paths of the most villainous description, which had never
been traversed but by farmers’ carts, and through which it was with the
greatest difficulty the carriages could be dragged, not only from the narrowness
of the roads, but from the horrifying ruts by which they were cut
up. At last, after indescribable difficulties, this portion of the cavalcade
reached a field in which it was said the two counties of York and Derby
were divided by a small bank. Here, with great difficulty, from the rocky
character of the subsoil, the ring was formed, and all waited with patience
<a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a><span class="pageno">346</span>
for the arrival of Parker and his division; but they waited in vain. It
was now ascertained that the ring was still in the county of Nottingham;
a fatal error. At last, when patience was exhausted, news arrived that
Parker had been more successfully led by turnpike roads to a place called
Brunt Lays, near Worksop, and to that place a move became inevitable.</p>

<p>The materials of the ring having been once more transferred to the cart in
which they had been brought, another pilgrimage was commenced through
paths if possible more perilous than the former, till finally by two o’clock
the desired goal was reached, and a fresh arena formed. But here a new
difficulty arose: the carriages and carts drew so close round the ring that
it was impossible to drive back the dense masses which had congregated.
There was but one remedy, and this was to carry off the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">materiel</span> to a new
position, where in maiden ground a more extensive field of action was
secured, and the throng as it approached being marshalled with a due regard
to the formation of a spacious area, the preliminaries were happily and
conveniently adjusted for the accommodation of all parties; the pedestrians
forming the inner circle, and the outer circle being composed of carriages,
carts, waggons, and horsemen. There were scarcely less than ten
thousand persons present, and a more imposing spectacle has seldom been
witnessed on any similar occasion. The police were in the rear of the
cavalcade as it moved, but they did not attempt to interfere, merely intimating
that “such scenes were contrary to Act of Parliament,” a piece of
information as novel as it was ineffective in preventing sport.</p>

<p>All being in readiness, the heroes were summoned to the lists; Parker
from an adjacent farm-house, where he had been hospitably sheltered, and
Brassey from the carriage which had conveyed him to the ground. Brassey
first made his appearance, attended by “King Dick” and Hall, with a
host of friends sporting their bright “yellowmen.” On throwing his
castor within the ropes he was received with shouts. Parker
next presented himself, under the care of Hunt and Nick Ward, and also
escorted by his backers, displaying fogles bearing the insignia of the
Royal Standard of England in four compartments. His reception was far
from flattering, and the yells of the roughs completely drowned the
friendly cheers of his admirers, but they created a strong sympathy in his
favour among the advocates of fair play. Betting was commenced
with great briskness, and 6 to 4 were freely laid and taken&mdash;&#8203;Brassey being
of course the favourite. There was the usual admission of privileged
spectators within the outer circle on the payment of a stipulated fee, and
<a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a><span class="pageno">347</span>
the difficulty of preserving order was proportionately increased; but at last
all was tolerably well adjusted, and the men commenced their toilettes.
The toss for choice of position was won by Brassey, who not only took
the higher ground, but placed his back to the sun, which was happily
shining with great brilliancy&mdash;&#8203;more favourable weather could not in fact
have been enjoyed. The colours of the men having been tied to the stakes
in the usual way, a curious scene followed. Several of the partisans of
each who wore colours agreed to bet them one against the other, and
these were also entwined to different stakes, giving to the ring an appearance
of unusual gaiety, from the brightness of the kerchiefs as they fluttered
in the breeze. Umpires and a referee having been chosen, little time was
lost in commencing business.</p>

<p>On Brassey being stripped his appearance by no means altered the estimate
we had formed of his condition on the previous night. He was
“unshaven” and “unshorn;” barbers being unknown on Lindrick Common,
he had not been able to obtain the assistance of one of the fraternity.
This gave a haggardness to his countenance&mdash;&#8203;not the most prepossessing&mdash;&#8203;which
was not calculated to raise him in the estimation of the spectators.
His flesh, too, appeared flabby, and there was an absence of that healthful
glow and muscular development which was observable at his contest with
Caunt. He struck us, too, as being out of spirits, although there was no
indication of the want of personal confidence. Parker, on the contrary,
was obviously “up to the mark,” his skin was clear and fresh in colour,
and his muscles exhibited a tensity indicative of rude health, while his
bearing was marked by unusual confidence. On standing together the disparity
of size was not so remarkable as might have been supposed, although
in height and frame Brassey had clearly the advantage. At twenty
minutes to three o’clock the men were conducted to “the scratch,” and
their seconds retired to their corners.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Brassey, on throwing himself
into position, stood erect, with his hands
well up and his head thrown back, but his
manner was stiff and constrained. There
was nothing of that graceful ease which distinguishes
an accomplished master of the art,
and which is characteristic of quickness and
activity. Parker was more free in his action,
his shoulder and head thrown slightly forward,
and his arms free and in playful attitudes,
low, but ready for a fly. Brassey
waited for the assault, and on Parker making
one or two dodges, showed himself well on
his guard. Brassey advanced, but Parker
broke away; at last Parker let go his left,
but was stopped. Brassey again made a forward
motion, and Parker retreated. Brassey
let out his right, but was short, and Parker
instantly popped in his left and fell. (Cries
of “Nick Ward has come to town” from the
Brasseyites.)</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Parker evidently creeping in to hit,
Brassey waiting. Slight exchanges with the
left, when Brassey popped in his right on
<a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a><span class="pageno">348</span>
Parker’s nose, and in the scuffle Parker got
down (cries of “First blood from Parker”),
and in a short time the purple fluid was seen
trickling from his nasal promontory.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Brassey on his guard, but Parker succeeded
in popping in his right; his left went
over Brassey’s shoulder. After slight exchanges,
Parker was down, his nozzle still
bleeding.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Parker tried his left and right, but did
not get home. Brassey rushed to him and
hit him slightly on the ear with his right.
He was preparing for further mischief, but
Parker slipped down, holding on by the ropes
with his left.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Parker led off again, left and right,
but without effect. Brassey followed him,
and in a wild rally, in which trifling hits
were exchanged, Brassey fell back on his
knee.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Parker, who was the first to go to
work, planted his left and right on Brassey’s
dial. Brassey tried his left in return, but
was short, and Parker slipped down.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Parker short with his left and right,
Brassey stepping back. Brassey attempted
to return with his left, but was also short.
Parker, in a second attempt, was more successful,
and delivered his left on Brassey’s
ogle. Brassey returned a round hit with his
right on Parker’s pimple. Slight exchanges,
when Parker let go his left with dire intent,
but Brassey ducked his nob and got away.
In a scramble which followed Parker got
down.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Parker dodging, Brassey waiting;
Parker let go his right, which got home on
Brassey’s cheek, but missed his left. Brassey
made play, but Parker retreated and
slipped on his knee, looking up at Brassey
as he approached. Brassey walked quietly to
his corner.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Brassey now changed his tactics and
led off, but Parker got away. Slight counter-hits
with the left. Parker retreated, but,
waiting an opportunity, popped in his left
twice in succession. Brassey followed, contemplating
mischief, but Parker got down.
(Cries of “Foul,” but no notice taken by
the umpires.)</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Parker tried his left and right, but
Brassey got away. Brassey advanced, hit
round with his right, but was short. Wild
exchanges with no effect, and Parker down.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Parker was the first to make play,
tried his left and right but did not get home.
He retreated, when Brassey followed him
up, shoved out his left, and Parker went down.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;An exchange of trifling hits, and
Parker down to avoid.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Up to this time there was no visible
appearance of punishment on either, with
the exception of the first blood already
noticed. Parker put in his left and right,
when Brassey caught him round his neck
with his left, and gave him a crack on the
ear with his right. Parker slipped down to
avoid a repetition of the compliment.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;(2 to 1 on Brassey). Counter-hits
with the left, but that of Brassey was more
like a shove than a hit; it wanted elbow-grease,
and made no impression. Brassey
closed, grasped his man with his left, and
was about to fib him with his right when
Parker slipped down to avoid.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Brassey came up eyeing his antagonist
with contempt. Parker approached him
slowly, and let fly his left and right, catching
him on the phiz. Brassey rushed at him
to return the compliment, but Parker went
down “nasty,” quite in the Nick Ward
style.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Parker, as usual, opened the ball,
but was stopped left and right. Brassey ran
to him, hit out slightly with his left, when
Parker fell on his back, Brassey falling over
him, with his knees on each side of his
body.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Parker hit over Brassey’s shoulder
with his left, and was going down to avoid
when Brassey hit him with his right hand
open on the back.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Parker again hit over with his left,
and Brassey followed him to the ropes, hitting,
without precision, left and right,
while Parker retreated and fell on his knees.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Smart exchanges left and right,
Parker napping it on the auricular, and
down to escape a repetition of the dose.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Parker popped in his left heavily on
Brassey’s mouth, from whence blood was
drawn. It was a stinging smack Brassey
rushed after him in the retreat, when Parker
fell, Brassey upon him.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Smart counters with the left, and
Brassey again paid a visit to Parker’s listener.
Parker, on Brassey’s efforts to engage him in
a rally, went down.</p>

<p>[This falling system on the part of Parker
caused many expressions of contempt on the
part of Brassey’s friends, and he was called
upon to “stand up and fight like a man.”]</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Parker pursued his dodging system,
and again delivered his left on Brassey’s
mouth. Brassey caught him with his right
on the side of the head, but was unable to
get home with his left; Parker dropped.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;A trifling exchange of hits left and
right, when Parker got down, Brassey falling
upon him.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Counter-hits with the left, but Brassey
did not get well home. Brassey tried
to bring his man to a rally, but he went
down to avoid.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Parker hit short with his left and
retreated to his corner. Brassey followed
boldly, when he napped it from the right
on the jaw. Brassey hit out left and right,
missing his man, and Parker went down.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Parker hit slightly left and right,
but in getting away from the return slipped
down.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Brassey led off, missing his left and
right, when Parker got away and went
down.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Parker, as usual, led off with his
<a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a><span class="pageno">349</span>
left, but caught it in return from Brassey’s
right on the lug. In the close Parker
caught Brassey round the waist, threw, and
fell on him, thereby showing that he possessed
strength enough if he had but
courage to use it.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;Counter-hits, followed by a close, in
which, after a slight struggle, Brassey threw
Parker on his back and fell on him. Parker
in going down caught at Brassey’s face open-handed,
and drew blood from his mouth.
(Cries of “He’s gouging him,” and exclamations
of disgust.)</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;Wild fighting, in which trifling exchanges
took place, and Parker went down,
Brassey falling on his knees beside him.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Parker led off, but Brassey retreated,
hitting out wildly. Parker rushed in to him,
and Brassey fell as he stepped back. From
this to the 38th round little mischief was
done. Parker generally led off, and occasionally
delivered heavy blows left and right,
which began to tell on Brassey’s phisog;
Brassey was far from idle, but Parker invariably
pursued his dropping system when
mischief was likely to ensue.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;In this round they looked at each
other for some time with their arms down,
Brassey laughing and shaking his flabby
sides, but still fresh and vigorous. At
last, on approaching nearer, Brassey let go
his left, with little effect. In the short
rally which followed Brassey received a
heavy right-handed thump on the jaw, and
Parker went down.</p>

<p>     In a rally in the 44th round heavy blows
were exchanged, Parker catching it on the
nose, which again commenced bleeding, but
he still pursued his getting down system.
In the 46th round Brassey led off, hitting
Parker on the ear with his right, and repeating
the dose with his left on the mouth
and nose; Parker down bleeding, and 3 to
1 offered on Brassey, although he had evidently
received the worst of the punishment.
Parker’s pusillanimous system of
dropping excited general disapprobation,
but he contrived so to time his tactics as to
keep within the pale of the law. Brassey’s
seconds, finding that Parker’s one two was
invariably set aside when Brassey led off,
urged him to let fly the moment Parker
approached; from these assaults, Parker,
stopping left and right, retreated, but in
the 55th round went down so palpably
without a blow, that cries of “Foul!” burst
from all quarters. An appeal was instantly
made to the referee, who, however, would
not pronounce his judgment till properly
applied to by the umpires, to whom no appeal
was at all made, and Brassey, instead
of retiring to his corner, as he ought to have
done, to await a deliberate decision, rushed
to take the handkerchiefs from the stake,
an example which “King Dick” followed.
At this moment Parker approached
Brassey, struck him a heavy blow with his
right, and a desperate rally ensued; heavy
hits were exchanged left and right, and in
the close both were down. On rising to
their seconds’ knees both showed severe
marks of punishment, Parker on his left
ear, and Brassey on his mouth and left eye.
This renewal of the combat with such mutual
good will necessarily set aside the claim of
“foul,” and thereby deprived Brassey of the
verdict of “victory,” which would doubtless
have been given in his favour.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_28" id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span>
</p>

<p>     56.&mdash;&#8203;Counter-hits with the left, when
Brassey caught Parker another of his terrific
round hits on the ear, and after a short
scramble Parker got down.</p>

<p>     57.&mdash;&#8203;A rally, in which heavy hits were
exchanged, Parker down, Brassey falling
upon him with his knees. (“Foul” was
claimed for Parker, but the intention was
not sufficiently apparent to justify a decision
in his favour, added to which, he provoked
the act by his own tricks.)</p>

<p>     From this to the 100th round the same
style of fighting was pursued, with alternate
changes, Parker receiving some heavy lunges
from Brassey’s right on his ear, which
was dreadfully swollen, and presented a
most unseemly aspect, and Brassey catching
it repeatedly on the mouth and face&mdash;&#8203;the
former of which was cut, and the latter exhibited
marks of repeated visitations. Parker
went down at the termination of almost
every round, obviously to avoid punishment;
but although this system was cowardly, and
opposed to the character of a fair stand-up
fight, he contrived so to time his prostrations,
as to keep himself within the pale of
the law; blows, however slight, having
been exchanged. The unnecessary length
of the spikes in his shoes might have had
some influence in the falls, but it was too
clear that he wanted a heart to stand up
manfully to give and take in the old
English fashion. From the 100th to the
117th round the same objectionable system
was pursued; but although numerous hits
were exchanged, and the marks of punishment
on the side of Parker’s head and Brassey’s
frontispiece increased in severity, there
was still no decisive mischief done. Brassey’s
left seemed to be of little use to him;
and although with Caunt he used it with
cutting effect, with Parker he did no execution,
and the right side of Parker’s face
was literally without a mark. Nevertheless,
<a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a><span class="pageno">350</span>
in the 118th round, Brassey was the favourite
at 2 to 1. From the 118th to the 127th
round, during which time the same style
of tactics was adopted, little visible
alteration took place in the spirits of the
men, both coming to the scratch with confidence,
but slowly. In the latter round,
however, Parker succeeded in delivering a
heavy blow with his right on Brassey’s nob,
who fell in a state of apparent insensibility.
All was now thought to be over, and a simultaneous
rush took place from all quarters to
the ring. “Time” was called, to which
Brassey did not respond. Parker, for whose
personal safety from the crowd apprehensions
were evidently entertained, was almost
immediately taken away, his seconds and
friends claiming the battle. To the astonishment
of all, however, Brassey rose, and
declared his readiness to renew the combat,
a claim which the referee, when appealed to,
allowed; for although more than eight
seconds had elapsed, by which time he ought
to have been at the scratch, still, as he had
not been duly summoned&mdash;&#8203;the umpires having,
in the confusion, neglected their duty&mdash;&#8203;he
was fairly entitled to the advantage. In
like manner it was determined that Parker,
who quitted the ring without first going to
the scratch, to which he had not been called,
was absolved from the penalty of the loss of
the battle to which his absence might otherwise
have exposed him.</p>

<p>     [This, again, imposes on seconds and umpires
the absolute necessity of obtaining a
perfect knowledge of their duty, and strictly
adhering to its dictates. From the great confusion
which prevailed in this instance some
excuse may be found, but it only confirms
our repeated observations on the great disadvantage
arising from permitting throngs
of partisans to congregate close to the milling
arena, who, by shouts and exclamations,
tend to interfere with that cool and dispassionate
judgment which the umpires and
referee should be permitted to exercise, and
which, in ancient times, was perfectly secured,
none but the umpires and referee
being then permitted to sit close to the ropes
and stakes.]</p>

<p>     Some delay took place before Parker returned,
one of his seconds declaring he had
been knocked down, an assertion which
proved without foundation, although on his
way to his carriage he had certainly fallen,
and execrations were showered upon him
from the friends of Brassey.</p>

<p>     With the 128th round the fight was renewed,
but amid such a riotous display of
party feeling from the crowd, which could
not be driven back from the ring, that it was
difficult to note the changes which took place.
Brassey exhibited unshrinking “game,” and
succeeded in planting some heavy blows with
his right on Parker’s ear, while the latter
was occasionally equally successful in delivering
his left and right on his opponent’s
disfigured mug. Parker, as usual, preserved
his cautious or rather questionable generalship,
and no sooner found himself in danger
than he got down. In point of freshness he
had a decided superiority over the unfortunate
Brassey, and not only hit oftener but
harder. In the 143rd round he planted the
first heavy body-blow with his right, the
effects of which were instantly visible on
Brassey’s countenance, who was almost
doubled up with pain. In the next round
he was equally successful with his left on the
body, and Brassey was again down. For the
three succeeding rounds Parker fought not
only with renewed vigour but with a more
manly and determined spirit, a change sufficiently
amounted for by the almost helpless
state of his antagonist, who was down in
every round.</p>

<p>     The friends of Brassey now saw that all
hope of a favourable change was extinguished.
The ropes were cut, and a crowd armed with
sticks and bludgeons rushed between the
men, and prevented the possibility of the
continuation of the fight. The most dreadful
confusion prevailed, during which Brassey
lay at full length with his head resting in
his second’s lap, who sat down on the ground
to receive him. He was evidently in a helpless
state, but still he refused to give in, declaring
himself perfectly ready to renew the
contest whenever the ring was cleared. Persuasions
and entreaties were all in vain to
induce the interlopers to retire. Parker’s
seconds claimed the battle; but this would
not be conceded; and after a long wrangle
between those who wished the fight to
be drawn and those who wished it to be
concluded, a body of horsemen were admitted
within the outer circle, who instantly
galloped round the fragments of the ropes
and stakes yet left standing, and effectually
succeeded in clearing the area. Those within
the ring then retired, and with some difficulty
the ropes were spliced and the ring
assumed something of its original form.
Brassey still continued to lie prostrate on
the earth, but there being no further impediment
to his once more resuming the battle
he was again called to the scratch. He came
up quite groggy, while Parker, on the contrary,
was fresh, and apparently as strong
as when he commenced the battle.</p>

<p>     It was soon seen that the forebodings of
Brassey’s friends would be confirmed, and
that his chance of success had indeed vanished.
In fact, Parker hit him as he liked,
his boldness increasing as his sense of danger
diminished. Still, from the 148th to
the 156th round, Brassey came valiantly to
the scratch, but was down in every round,
and was obviously incapable of stemming
the current of misfortune. His friends
again forced themselves into the ring; but
“King Dick,” feeling the folly and foreseeing
the danger which a repetition of punishment
under such circumstances might
incur, refused to second him any longer,
and the unfortunate fellow at last consented
<a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a><span class="pageno">351</span>
to give in. He then shook hands
with Parker, who although thus crowned
with the wreath of victory, was certainly
not entitled to praise for either manliness
or gallantry. He retired from the field
perfectly fresh with few marks of punishment,
save those on his left ear and on the
left side of his <em>caput</em>, which were certainly
most wofully damaged. Brassey was completely
exhausted, and almost in a state of
stupefaction from the repeated visitations,
left and right, to his knowledge box. His
lip was split, and in other respects his punishment
sufficiently testified that he had
not left off till nature had deserted him. It
is needless to say that his friends and himself
were deeply mortified and disappointed
by the result. The fighting was rapid, time
called quick, and the rounds extremely
short, which will account for the number of
rounds is so limited a period.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;We candidly confess that
from first to last we never witnessed a fight
the conclusion of which was less satisfactory.
We have more than once expressed our disgust
at that species of tumble-down fighting
by which men, regardless of the principles of
fair stand-up boxing, seek to punish others,
while by cowardly subterfuges they escape
punishment themselves. It is a species of
paltry cunning to which no true British
boxer would have recourse, and which in
Parker’s case, as well as that of Nick
Ward, admits of no apology. It is ridiculous
to say that such manœuvres are consistent
with good generalship, or excusable
when small men are opposed to men of
greater bulk; because, if small men are incapable
of fighting men of larger size by fair
means, it is not incumbent on them to enter
the lists at all. But here the disparity of
size was by no means such as to justify the
adoption of such a mode of defence. From
the first it was clear that Parker was not
only the better fighter left and right, but
was the harder hitter; and if he had had
the courage to exercise those physical qualities
which he possessed, and fought fairly
and manfully at his man, there is little
doubt that he would have brought the combat
to a similar issue in one-third of the
time. That he actually went down without
a blow in more instances than one the spectators
must have been perfectly satisfied,
although on those particular occasions the
appeals to the referee were not legally and
properly made; and that he frequently
went down equivocally is equally certain,
but he had always self-possession and
cunning enough to take care that he did not
have recourse to these tricks except under
circumstances where no adverse decision
could be formed. He was repeatedly warned
by the referee, but he declared solemnly
he could not help it. On quitting the ring
he vauntingly forewarned Caunt, who was
present, that he would ere long have a
tussle with him for the Champion’s belt,
but we apprehend this is idle bounce, which
he will be very unlikely ever to realise. With
regard to Brassey, he utterly disappointed
the anticipations of his friends. He no
longer presented the formidable front by
which he was distinguished in his contest
with Caunt; he seemed, in fact, to have
lost that gift of hitting left and right of
which the head of Caunt, after their fight,
afforded such signal testimony. His left
hand appeared to be utterly ineffective, and
when he did hit with it it was rather a
shove than a blow, while the hits with his
right hand were anything but decisive,
although from their repetition they seemed
at one time to threaten the ultimate defeat
of his shifty antagonist. Of Parker’s cleverness
and pusillanimity the reader will find
further examples in the account of his defeat
by Perry, the Tipton Slasher, in our
memoir of that boxer, forming Chapter <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>
of this volume.</p>

 It should never be forgotten by seconds that the referee is distinctly bound by the 4th
of the New Rules of the Ring, to “withhold all opinion till appealed to by the umpires.”
And it is to those umpires alone that the first appeal should be made; not by bystanders,
who may be influenced by personal interest, but by the seconds alone, a rule which is unfortunately
but too frequently forgotten, and which was in this instance attended by
unfortunate consequences to Brassey&mdash;&#8203;<span class="sc"><abbr title="Editor">Ed.</abbr></span></p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>&mdash;&#8203;<span class="sc">TASS PARKER, of West Bromwich, and HARRY
PRESTON, of Birmingham, for £100.</span></h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">As</span> the name of Harry Preston has more than once occurred in connection
with the subjects of Memoirs in our history, and was at one period
of his career thought good enough for a match for £300 with Young
<a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a><span class="pageno">352</span>
Dutch Sam (see <span class="sc">Pugilistica</span>, <abbr title="Volume Two">Vol. II.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 388), we shall here give his last
battle, which was also memorable as being Tass Parker’s first Ring
victory. The articles, which fixed the 8th of May, 1838, as the day of
meeting, and the stakes to be fought for at £200, and further stipulated
that Preston should confine himself to 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, were duly complied with,
Preston, on the morning of fighting, balancing 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, which many considered
8<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> below his best standard. Harry, it must be borne in mind,
was an “old stager,” having credited to him, in the previous ten years,
seven victories, two draws (one with Young Dutch Sam, already alluded
to, the other with Davis, of Birmingham, whom he afterwards conquered),
and but <em>one</em> defeat, and that by the scientific Jem Wharton (Young Molyneaux).
It was, therefore, to be expected that 6 to 4 was readily offered
on Preston, and that the defeat of Parker, who, notwithstanding his admitted
superior skill with the gloves, had been twice beaten by the renowned
Hammer Lane, with a prevalent doubt of his gameness, should have
been booked as a certainty; the sequel, however, proved that in the
Ring, as on the Turf, “public running” is not always to be implicitly
relied on.</p>

<p>On the morning of the event we found ourselves in Sawley, a village in
Derbyshire, eight miles south-west of Nottingham, where we were introduced
to Preston, at a “public” on the banks of the Trent, wherein he
had taken up his quarters. He spoke confidently of his prospects of success,
and treated his reduction of weight as by no means reducing his capabilities.
We, however, did not share his opinion; though lighter bodily, his
face struck us as more puffy than is consistent with perfect training, and
he did not impress us with the idea of a man hardened by his exercises.
Of Parker’s whereabouts we could learn nothing; and a warning
being given that “a magistrate was in the village with an escort of police,”
Preston was hastily disguised and got out of danger; and not a bit too
soon, for scarcely was Preston on the road to Appleby, when a clerical
“beak,” with a constable and three or four “specials,” armed with a warrant
for “three counties,” as we were informed, made their unwelcome
appearance. In justice to these officials, however, we must say that they
behaved in what poor Jack Scroggins called “a gentlemanlike sort of a way,”
and gave all to understand that they should exercise their undoubted
powers with moderation, and that if “the peace” of Derbyshire was
unmolested, their function would then and there cease. Away, then, for
Leicestershire, towards Ashby-de-la-Zouch&mdash;&#8203;renowned in days of old for
<a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a><span class="pageno">353</span>
its tournaments and “passage of arms”&mdash;&#8203;was the word. Now, as fighting
Ashby (fifteen miles from Leicester) was about seventeen from where we
then were, and as it was already past twelve o’clock, the “fixture” was
indeed a damper, many remembering how they were thrown out
when Caunt and Bendigo held their first “joust” at Appleby. The
cloud, however, passed away when, about a mile and a half beyond Castle
Donington, a hint was given that in a field not three hundred yards from
the turnpike-road, yet out of view of it, a secluded spot was at the service
of the weary wayfarers. A general halt was made; each man was temporarily
housed in an adjacent “Tom and Jerry;” and these establishments
being each luckily provided with considerable stabling, every stall and shed
was at once occupied by vehicles and quadrupeds, while the bipeds consumed
every eatable and drinkable, to the last loaf and the last “tilt of
the barrel,” in both establishments. These despatched, word was brought
that the Birmingham Commissary had pitched his stakes, and all moved
off to a pretty dell, where, on a nice bit of turf, surrounded by gentle
slopes thickly wooded, the lists were formed; not a few aspiring countrymen
and youths ascending the trees nearest the ring, and forming a
“rookery” whence a vocal, but not very musical, “cawing” was heard at
intervals of the fight.</p>

<p>At two o’clock precisely, Preston made his appearance, and shied his
pimple-coverer into the ring; an example immediately followed by Parker,
who stepped briskly into the arena, and with a good-humoured smile went
up to Preston and shook hands with apparent cordiality. There was a
buoyant springiness in Parker, and a confidence in his appearance, which
seemed to say “I mean winning, and nothing else.” Preston’s manner
was more subdued&mdash;&#8203;he looked serious, but exhibited nothing like distrust
in his own powers. Betting was 6 to 4 on Preston, which, in a few
instances, was taken, Parker’s partisans seeming doubtful of their man.
The colours having been fastened to the stakes, and umpires and a referee
chosen, the men stripped. Parker’s condition appeared excellent&mdash;&#8203;he
looked as fine as a star, and weighed exactly 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> Preston looked
delicate&mdash;&#8203;his flesh did not appear firm, nor had it the roseate hue of health.
At fourteen minutes after two the men came to the scratch&mdash;&#8203;Peter Taylor
and Nick Ward seconding Parker; and Dick Davis and Holland, both of
Birmingham, performing the same friendly office for Preston. After the
usual formalities,
</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT</p>

<p>     Commenced, Preston having the sun shining
brilliantly in his face. “It will be a merry
fight,” said Taylor, who had been taking
the odds of 3 to 2; “but my man is in a
merry mood, and means winning, and
nothing else.” Preston’s attitude was good;
he appeared ready either for the offensive
or defensive, and watched his man closely,
who was also on the alert; Preston trying
to draw him, and making two or three
feints, but Parker was wide awake. Preston
made a hit, but Parker jumped back, keeping
his hands well up. After two or three
feints, Preston hit right and left; Parker
countered; several exchanges, slightly in
favour of Preston. A smartish rally, each
trying to give the upper-cut; a short struggle,
and both down, Preston under. “First
blood” was claimed for Parker, and admitted;
it was from a slight blow on the
mouth. This round occupied four minutes,
and was in favour of Preston; but the
Parkerites were uproarious, Tassey having
gained the first event.</p>

<p>     Round 2.&mdash;&#8203;After sparring for some time,
neither man liking to commence operations,
Preston put in a tidy one with his left on
the ribs without a return; more sparring;
Preston got in his left, and Parker countered
well. Both on their mettle, and
rapid exchanges of compliments passed,
each anxiously trying to give the upper-cut.
Parker planted a facer, and Preston returned
under the left ear. Loud cheering for both
men animated them to redouble their exertions;
and after a sharp and merry round,
in which there was good fighting on both
sides, both down, Preston under. Preston
had rather the best of this round. This
round lasted 16 minutes.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Long sparring; Preston trying to
“gammon” his man to begin, but Parker
seemed to be down to Preston’s moves. At
length Preston led off with his left, which
was well stopped; Parker countered smartly,
and fought well before him, boring his man,
who gave his head away. Preston tried to
give the upper-cut, but failed. “Give and
take as much and as quickly as you can”
appeared to be the motto of each, and they
rattled away merrily without any decided
lead to either. This was the best-contested
round in the fight, and Parker proved
himself a better man than many anticipated.
He stood well to his gun, and not a few
thought Preston began not to fancy his man
quite so much. Indeed, Harry found him
stick closer to him than he expected, and a
much sharper fighter than he had calculated
upon; still, the round was, if anything,
favourable to Preston. 25 minutes had
elapsed.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;The effects of the last round and the
heat of the day appeared not to suit Preston.
He had a slight mouse on the left eye,
when he came to the scratch, and hemmed
several times, as if a “little” touched
in the wind. Preston manœuvring to draw
his man; Parker hit short. After sparring
for some time, Parker put his hands
down as a “ticer.” After a little more
sparring, Parker made his one-two without
a return, and followed his man briskly.
Preston’s face covered with perspiration,
both hit together; exchanges, Parker driving
his man to the ropes, where he fell,
Parker upon him. (Shouts for Parker, and
cries of “He’s got Harry; where’s your 6
to 4?”)</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;This was a short round; Parker took
the lead, and hit his man well and smartly,
gave him no time for parrying, but bustled
away. Preston relished this mode of attack
so little that he turned from his man.
(“What do you say now? Why it’s Donington
Hall to a cowshed!” exclaimed
Peter Taylor. “Oh, my man’s got him
beautifully&mdash;&#8203;it’ll soon be over.”) Parker
stuck to his man; delivering rapidly as he
went in, and Preston went down.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Preston looked as if he meant mischief,
but was fearful of going in; after he
had made a few feints, Parker went boldly
in, hitting away right and left, and, to
avoid punishment as well as fatigue, Preston
went down in a short rally. (“He’s coming
it”&mdash;&#8203;the Tassites uproarious, and the
layers of odds rather blue.)</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Parker found he had got his man,
went to work instanter, and drove him
before him, and Preston fell outside of the
ropes. (“He’s done for!” was the general
exclamation of the Parkerites).</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Parker determined not to give a
chance away, commenced fighting instanter;
Preston giving his head, and making no
defence, slipped down. (Cries of disapprobation.)</p>

<p>     In the next round Preston was driven out
of the ropes; and the three following
rounds were all one way. It was clear that
Preston’s chance was gone. From the fourth
round he appeared to fight like a man who
had either made up his mind to be beaten, or
was so dreadfully out of condition that he had
not the power to make any defence. At the
end of the thirteenth round, on being lifted
up, he could not, or would not, stand; and
his seconds gave in for him. Preston’s
friends said he was seriously hurt, in a very
tender part of the body, by Parker falling
upon him. He certainly looked faint and
ill, but Parker’s friends denied the assertion,
and the Brums were loud and deep in
their expression of disgust and indignation.
Time 40 minutes.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;The fight was over at twenty
minutes to three, and certainly disappointed
every one who saw it; after the third round
Preston appeared to be “down on his
luck;” still, many thought he was only
“gammoning,” but the conclusion of the
fourth round convinced the most sceptical
that the glory of Harry had departed, for
<a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a><span class="pageno">355</span>
he never stood well up to his man afterwards.
He gave his head every round, and
fell to avoid punishment in a manner that
excited feelings of contempt. Parker from
the first showed great confidence; when
he found he had “got his man,” he bustled
in and gave him no time for breathing, and
although two pounds the lighter, proved
himself by far the stronger man; he used
both hands well and quickly. Among the
members of the Ring on the ground were
Hammer Lane and his brother Surrender,
Lazarus, Johnny Broome, and Bill Atkinson;
Caunt, Merryman, and several others
were thrown out. Preston exhibited no
severe marks of punishment, excepting a
mouse under the left eye, and a swelling of
the left ear, although Parker appeared to
have given him several “hot ’uns.” Parker
appeared as fresh as when he began. If, as
Preston said, “He never was better,” it
is clear he never used his physical advantages
to less effect. That he is a game man
he has on more occasions than one signally
proved, and his defeat can only be attributed
to a falling off in power and lasting
quality; while the proverb that “youth will
be served” receives another illustration in
Parker’s rapid success when he found his
adversary’s strength had left him. Tom
Spring being stakeholder the money was
handed to the victorious Tass at the
“Castle,” Holborn, on the ensuing Thursday
week, who then and there challenged
Britton of Liverpool. With that boxer
Tass fought, on the 8th May, 1839, a drawn
battle. Britton was subsequently arrested,
and bound over for twelve months. The
men met again on the 9th of June, 1840,
when Parker was victorious after 77 rounds
fought in 1 hour and 50 minutes, and was
thereafter matched with Brassey of Bradford,
with the result we have already narrated
in a former page.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>&mdash;&#8203;AARON JONES AND BOB WADE (THE DOVER
CHAMPION).</h3>

<p class="p2">“’Tis not in mortals to command success,” says Addison in his sententious
“Cato,” though they may “do more&mdash;&#8203;that is, deserve it.” Aaron
Jones, born in 1831&mdash;&#8203;who, in his first essay in the Ring, at the age of 18,
had the ill luck to encounter the formidable Harry Orme (in 1849), when
he fought him for 2 hours and 45 minutes, at Frimley, as we have already
narrated&mdash;&#8203;was a notable instance of this. Jones’s after-defeats by Orme,
Paddock, and Tom Sayers being herein set down, we now propose to
resuscitate and “photo” the only gleam of sunshine in Aaron’s clouded
career. This was his battle with Bob Wade, called the Dover Champion,
on the 24th September, 1850.</p>

<p>From the time of Jones’s first defeat he had been anxious for a second
customer; but his friends dissuaded him, and gave him the good advice to wait
until another year or two had hardened gristle into bone, and set the stamp
of endurance on his frame. The youngster, however, was impatient and
importunate, and a cavalry officer, to whom Jones had been known in his
boyhood, and who was a constant visitor at Jem Burn’s, on Jones calling
his attention to a challenge from Bob Wade, offering himself as a candidate
<a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a><span class="pageno">356</span>
for the favours of any 12 stone man, for the small stake of £25 a side,
consented to find the quarter of a hundred needful for the match. To
improve the amount for the men, it was arranged that they should join in
hiring a train on the South Eastern line, in conjunction with the clever little
Joe Hoiles (“The Spider”), who was articled to do battle with Jemmy
Madden, on the 24th of September. Accordingly, the “excursionists”
repaired, on the morning of that day, to the London Bridge terminus of
the South Eastern; for as yet the London, Chatham, and Dover was not.
The day was delightful, and the destination, Edenbridge, Kent, was
reached by noon. Here the travellers alighted at the foot of a rude set of
steps cut in the turf embankment. These surmounted, a walk of a few
hundred yards down a shady lane, out of sight of travellers by the rail,
brought Tom Oliver’s roped square in view, and the smaller couple of heroes
were soon at work. After a lively exhibition of game and resolution on
one side, and artistic skill, with precise and cutting execution, on the other,
“The Spider” succeeded in knocking his sturdy little opponent out of time.</p>

<p>The bantams having settled their difference of opinion, the bigger brace
of “unfeathered bipeds” appeared in the pit&mdash;&#8203;we beg pardon, the ring. Jones
looked youthful, fair, cheerful, and symmetrical; his height 5 feet 11 inches,
his weight 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> Wade, on the other hand, was a brown and hardy
veteran, his look as solid as his carcase, and his weight the same as Jones.
His more compact frame, however, gave him quite two inches less stature
than the Young’un. Jones had two excellent seconds in Alec Keene and Bob
Fuller, while Wade had no reason to complain, having the services of the
gallant Jack Grant and the accomplished Bill Hayes. It was currently
reported that Jones had made rapid improvement since his encounter with
Harry Orme, in the previous December, and hence he had the call in the
betting at 5 to 4. We prefer giving a description to a mere numbered
detail of the rounds.</p>

<p>In leading off, after a few seconds spent in manœuvring, Jones got in
his left so cleverly and effectively on Wade’s jaw-bone that he not only
staggered the veteran, but sent him against the centre stake with such force
that his head was cut severely, and bled profusely throughout the after
rounds of the fight. Wade, nevertheless, returned to the charge, and in
the exchanges caught Jones a sounding right-hander in the ribs, after
which both were down in a scrambling rally. In the second round Jones
displayed superior science, nobbing Wade neatly, who, however, when he
got to half-arm hitting, pegged away with resolution and effect, until again
<a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a><span class="pageno">357</span>
both were on the grass, with hardly any “best” in the matter, though Jones’s
friends were uproarious in their encouragement of their man.</p>

<p>From the third to the tenth round Wade worked away well, Jones not
seeming able to meet him with sufficient precision and certainty as he came
in. When the men got together, ding-dong hitting and give and take was
the order of the day; thus they roughed away until one or the other
was down in the hitting, Wade the most frequently, Jones’s superior and
straighter style gradually improving his position. In the twelfth round
Wade, who had certainly by far the larger share of the punishment, caught
Aaron a stinging hit on the nose, and so severe was its effect that for the
moment it brought the Young’un forward in a state of mystification, and,
hitting out at random, he came upon his knees. The Dover lads were
vociferous in their acclamations, but Jones came up steady, and in the
next round, nailing Wade as he came rashly in, balanced the account by
battering his already damaged figure-head. In the succeeding three or four
rounds Jones stopped Wade’s rush effectually. Both men rallied with
great determination, and many thought that the lasting stamina of Wade
must wear out the active spurts of Jones. In a rally in the 25th round,
the Dover veteran hit Jones down with a swinging body-blow, and the hopes
of his partisans were again buoyant. Wade, however, was too much
abroad from severe hitting to take full advantage of his chance, and again
and again his adversary administered punishment, as he followed him up to
force the fighting. In the 39th round, Jones having propped Wade three
or four times in succession without a return, the Old’un fell. Fifty-six
minutes had elapsed, and amidst cries of “Take him away!” Wade came
up for the 40th round, and Jones, in a half-arm rally, milled him down.
The 41st and 42nd rounds presented little variation, Wade obstinately
refusing to give in, though so advised by his friends; and at length, just as
the hour had expired, and Wade had come up for the 43rd bout, Jones
nailed him two straight ones, the first on the side of the head, the second
on the mouth, and down went poor Bob, to all intents and purposes a
beaten man. Jones was highly elated at his conquest, which was certainly
creditable to the youngster, as his experienced antagonist was one of that
old-fashioned “give and take” school, the members of which are not to be
beaten by any boxer who cannot stand heavy retaliation in return for the
favours he may bestow upon his opponent, even by superior skill or activity.
The money, £50, was given up to Jones on the following Thursday, at
Mr. Prior’s, South Audley Street, when the brave Old Bob received a
<a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a><span class="pageno">358</span>
liberal supply of “golden ointment” to heal his disappointment and his
bodily hurts.</p>

<p>Jones, for a long period, up to the present year, 1881, has been living
in America, where he has earned respect for his civility, steadiness, good
behavour, and his skill as a teacher of the art of boxing. A paragraph
in a recent newspaper informs us of his return to the Old Country at the
age of fifty-one.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">TOM SAYERS (CHAMPION).&mdash;&#8203;1849&ndash;1860.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">As</span> seven cities contended for the honour of being the birthplace of
Homer, so, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">parvis componere magna</span>, half a dozen places, English and Irish,
have been named as the spot of dull earth whereon the last Champion of
England opened his sharp little grey eyes. Somers Town and Camden
Town, his favourite haunts in later life; Pimlico, now a palatial precinct
of Belgravia, and several other places, have been oracularly declared, in
“Answers to Correspondents,” in sundry sporting journals, to have been
the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus in quo</span> Tom struggled into what proved in his case literally “the
battle of life.” A clever sporting writer (“Augur”) remarks with truth
that “Ireland makes it her rule of faith always to claim the winner, be it
man, woman, or quadruped. The ‘divided honours’ of Farnborough presented
no obstacle to this. She adopted the maternity of Heenan out of
hand, and with fair pretence, and now she has put in a <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</span> claim
to Tom Sayers. A regular county Kerry genealogy has been found
for him, including a maternal aunt, who, naturally and nationally attributes
his valour to her family infusion of the ‘blood of the Fitzgeralds!’”</p>

<p>In the memoir in <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, at the date alluded to (which to our
knowledge was from the pen of a trueborn Celt), we read “Tom Sayers,
whose parents came from Dingle, in the county of Kerry,” &amp;c. This
gossip we pass, being able to state from personal knowledge, not
only that Tom was born at “Pimlico,” a place of “fish-like smell,” in the
middle of Brighton, Sussex, on May 25th, 1828, but that his father, “Old
Tom,” so called from the bronzed complexion he transmitted to his son,
<a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a><span class="pageno">360</span>
whom he survives, is a genuine Sussex man, born at Storrington, near
Steyning, in that county, where he was baptised in 1793, and in 1819
married a home-born and home-bred Sussex woman. Tom’s pedigree,
therefore, is indisputably that of an Englishman. How he passed his
youth, pushing off the Brighton hog-boats from the shingly beach of
London-super-mare, we may also pass. In due time he was placed out to
the trade of a bricklayer, and we have heard him say his first “big job”
was on the Preston Viaduct of the Brighton and Lewes Railway, a noble
structure of stone and white brick, visible from the Brighton terminus,
crossing the Preston Road. Tom quitted Sussex, and in 1848 he was
following his vocation on the extensive works of the North Western
Railway at Camden Town, a locality for many years a favourite with
the departed Champion.</p>

<p>Sayers’s Ring career was doubtless one of the most remarkable on record,
his fights extending over twelve years, 1849&ndash;1860, besides numerous earlier
battles. They were, within the regular <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> ropes, sixteen in number,
including one defeat and a wrangled “draw;” and in all but three cases
against heavier and bigger men; for soon after the opening of his career no
professional of his weight and inches cared to tackle him.</p>

<p>Tom was in his twenty-third year when, having migrated in the pursuit
of employment from Brighton to Camden Town, he was induced by the
challenge of one Aby Couch, and the stake of a “fiver,” to meet his opponent
“down the river,” in the ropes of old Commissary Oliver. The
affair came off on March 19th, 1849, near Greenhithe, when Tom sent
Couch to rest in less than 13 minutes. For more than a twelvemonth
Tom’s friends looked in vain for a customer at 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, or thereabouts, but
could not find one, though they declared him not particular to a
few pounds.</p>

 <p class="caption">A TRIO OF CHAMPIONS&mdash;&#8203;THE THREE TOMS.</p>
</div>

<p>At length “Tom Spring’s waiter,” Dan Collins, whom we remember as
a civil, smart, intelligent news-boy, petitioned his worthy master for a shy
at Master Thomas, and articles were agreed for £25 a side, to fight on October
22nd, 1850. Dan was about an inch taller than Sayers, and a trifle
heavier, though each on the day was under 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> His known skill, too,
from his exhibitions at Spring’s, made him the favourite, though he had
been defeated by Ned Donnelly in the previous year. We well remember
the surprise of the veteran Vincent Dowling (Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> for
more than its first quarter of a century), and of Tom Spring, not only at
the tough resolution and remarkable endurance and strength of the
“novice,” as the Camden Town hero was called, but at the gameness with
<a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a><span class="pageno">361</span>
which poor Dan, sadly overmatched, took his “gruel.” At Edenbridge,
Kent, in the first ring, they fought nine resolute rounds in 27 minutes,
when, the rural constabulary intruding, the belligerents retired to Red
Hill. Spring considerately proposed to Dan to decline, saying “He had
fought quite enough for his money,” but Dan earnestly entreated, and was
indulged, when thirty-nine more rounds were fought in 1 hour 52 minutes,
both men being heavily punished. Darkness now interposed, and the final
trial was postponed to December 10th, to meet in the same ring as Young
Sambo (Welsh) and Cross. This draught-board game proving a draw
between black and white, burned out two hours and a half of the short
daylight, and there was no time for Sayers and Dan to exhibit; so once
more the decision was deferred.</p>

<p>On April 29th, 1851, Sayers and Collins met in fistic fray at Long
Reach. The improvement of Sayers in skill made poor Dan appear to
have fallen off, and though he struggled gallantly through forty-four
rounds, occupying 84 minutes, the tide never turned in his favour. Collins
scaled 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 2<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> at this second meeting, Sayers 9<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> If Tom
reaped fame by this contest, there was but little profit in training three
times for a quarter of a hundred “yellowboys.”</p>

<p>The great improvement of Sayers on this occasion was evident to every
judge of boxing; he took a strong lead, was never headed, and won in a
canter. If there was little profit in three trainings and three fights for
one stake, Tom gained confidence and lots of friends. His weight, however&mdash;&#8203;too
heavy for the nine-stone men, and underweight for the “middles”
and “heavies”&mdash;&#8203;kept him without a match for nearly a year. The
“empty praise” of his friends, too, kept him from the “solid pudding,” so
that none of the 9<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> men cared to meddle with him. Various challenges
in the columns of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> show the impatience with which Tom bore
this enforced inactivity. At length, to the surprise and delight of the
Southwarkians, Tom had, what they thought, the presumptuous hardihood
to offer to meet the renowned Jack Grant, for £100 a side. Jack was at
the top of his renown. He had beaten James Haggerty, drawn with Mike
Madden (daylight failing), beaten Alec Keene, and received forfeit from the
talented Callaghan of Derby. Winning, and nothing else, was the idea of
the Borough lads. The mill came off at Mildenhall, Suffolk, June 29th,
1852, for £100 a side. Grant was attended by Harry Orme and Jemmy
Welsh; Sayers by Nat Adams and Bob Fuller the pedestrian. Betting

<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On appearing at the scratch,
the condition and general appearance of
Sayers was the theme of admiration:
there was not an ounce of superfluous flesh
about his body&mdash;&#8203;he appeared all wire and
muscle. His phiz wore a good-humoured
smile of confidence, and there was a ruddy
glow upon his cheek which told of good
health and condition. His attitude was
graceful and firm, and, to a good judge, it
was apparent that if he was as good as he
looked the Borough Champion had his work
cut out. Grant seemed not quite up to the
mark. His arms, it is true, were muscular
and brawny, and his good-tempered mug
looked healthy; but there were certain
accumulations of fat upon his chest and ribs
which sufficiently indicated that his exercise
had not been so severe as it might have
been, and we were informed that, instead of
weighing about 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 2<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> he turned the
scale at 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> Notwithstanding his
lustiness, however, he appeared to look
upon the result with quiet confidence, and
to hold his adversary at a very cheap rate.
His position indicated the old tactician&mdash;&#8203;the
arms well up, and not too far from his body,
his head back, and his eye fixed upon that
of his adversary, who stood well over him,
and was longer in the reach. After a little
dodging, Grant, who was anxious to begin,
led off with his left, slightly reaching Tom’s
forehead, and jumped away from the return.
Sayers followed him up, when Grant tried
to repeat the dose on the forehead, but was
prettily stopped. Sayers at length got
home with his right on the ribs, which was
followed by heavy counter-hits, Grant on
the left cheek, and Sayers heavily on Grant’s
nose. Ditto repeated, when Sayers gained
“first blood” from a cut over that organ.
Grant then went in to force the fighting,
but Sayers stepped back, jobbed him again
on the nose, cleverly stopping the return.
Counter hits succeeded, Sayers catching a
nasty one on the left side of the head, and
on getting back slipped down.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Grant tried to lead off several times,
but was on each occasion well stopped. He
returned the compliment by twice stopping
Sayers, and then lunged out his right, catching
Sayers heavily under the left ear. Tom
countered him with effect on the nose, and
a close following, both were down; Sayers
under.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Grant took the initiative, but Sayers
jumped away smiling; he, however, came
again directly, and led off with his left, but
was stopped. He was more successful a
second time, and reached Grant’s damaged
nose. Grant closed for the fall, but Sayers
would not struggle, contenting himself with
fibbing Grant on the nose and left ear until
both rolled over.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Mutual good stopping, after which
Sayers delivered his left heavily on Grant’s
ribs and jumped away. Counter-hits with
the left followed&mdash;&#8203;Sayers on the nose, and
Grant on the ribs. A close, and some sharp
fibbing. A break away, and at it again,
Grant delivering his right heavily on Tom’s
left eye. Slight exchanges, Grant again getting
it on the nose, and Sayers slipped down.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Both, on coming up, looked flushed.
Sayers smiled, while Grant looked grim.
The latter led off, but was twice stopped.
They then got to work; sharp counter-hits
were exchanged, Sayers receiving heavily
on the left cheek, and Grant on the nose and
jaw. A close and struggle for the fall ended
in Grant being thrown, but not heavily.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers tried to lead off, but Grant
was wary, and stopped him. He was not to
be denied; however, he made another attempt,
and again reached Grant’s smeller,
getting well away from the return. Sayers
then repeated the dose heavily with both
hands, and followed this up by one or two
punches in the ribs. At length Grant swung
round his dangerous right, and caught Master
Tom a tremendous whack on the left
ear, which staggered him. Grant then
closed, but Sayers declined to struggle for
the fall, and fibbed away at his man until
he allowed him to slip down.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers showed the effects of Grant’s
visitation to his left ear, which was considerably
swelled. Grant looked flushed
from the taps on the nozzle. The latter led
off, but was quite out of distance, and Sayers
followed his example by delivering too
high to be of any service. Exchanges then
took place, each catching it on the right eye,
Sayers’ delivery appearing to be the heavier.
In getting away Sayers slipped down.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Grant took the lead, but was again
stopped, and caught an awkward one on the
left listener for his pains. He then succeeded
in planting his left on Tom’s forehead.
Grant bored in, but Sayers stepped back,
administering an upper-cut, which led to
a rally, in which some sharp hitting took
place, and Sayers scrambled down.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Both slightly blown. Tom stopped
Grant’s attempts to plant on him, and then
delivered his left on the nose twice in succession.
Grant again made his right sound
against the left side of Tom’s head, and then
sent in a heavy one on the ribs. Sayers,
nothing daunted, was at him again, popped
in his left on the cheek and his right on
Grant’s left ear, and this bringing them to
a struggle, Sayers letting himself down easy.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Grant tried to force the fighting by
boring in, but got it on the left eye rather
heavily. Sayers, however, had not the
strength to stall him off. He again went in,
caught Sayers on the left eye, and in a
struggle which followed the latter again
slipped down to avoid being thrown.
</p>
<a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a><span class="pageno">363</span>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Grant led off, got well home on
Sayers’ left ear, and then closed, and both
rolled over together.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers’ left ear and left side of his
head were much swollen; still he smiled,
and calmly awaited the attack, which was
not long in coming. Grant dashed in, and
commenced hitting away with both hands;
he drew blood from Tom’s mouth by a heavy
spank from his left. Sayers delivered on
the left cheek, and the round finished by
both falling together at the ropes.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Grant made his right with severity
on the ribs, getting away from Sayers’ return.
Sayers followed him up, and some sharp
hits were exchanged left and right, both
catching it on the nose and cheek, and
Grant at length got down.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Grant dashed in resolutely, but
twice was well stopped. Sayers then
delivered his left and right on the nose and
left eye. Grant, not liking this, bored in,
made his right on Tom’s left cheek, closed,
but Sayers catching well hold of him, threw
him a cross-buttock and fell on him.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Both, anxious to get to work, led off
at the same time, and each got it on the left
eye. Grant was then neatly stopped twice
in succession, but at length closed, and some
sharp in-fighting took place, Sayers catching
it on the left eye, and Grant on the left ear.
The round ended by both going to grass.
(Forty minutes had now elapsed, and those
who had backed Grant to win in an hour
began to look blue.)</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;A capital round. After some excellent
stopping and manœuvring on both sides,
they got close together, and some sharp exchanges
took place, each catching it on the
nose and left cheek. A close ensued, followed
by a break away, and both at it again,
left and right, until Grant got down, somewhat
blown, his want of condition evidently
beginning to tell.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Somewhat similar to the last, each
catching it severely on the side of the head.
The hitting appeared rather in favour of
Grant, who drew more claret from Tom’s
mouth. Both were eventually down.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Grant dashed in and closed for a fall,
but Sayers declined the struggle, fibbed
him severely on the left ear several times,
and Grant slipped down. He lay on his
back where he fell, blowing like a grampus
until time was called, when he was carried
to his corner, from whence he walked to the
scratch.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Some good exchanges, Sayers on the
right eye, and Grant on the nose, removing
the bark, and drawing a fresh supply of the
ruby. Quick exchanges, but both apparently
hitting open-handed, were followed by Tom
getting down cleverly.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Grant, whose ear had been lanced,
came up bleeding from that organ, which
was much swelled from the blows in the
18th round. He rushed in, but Sayers
caught him heavily on the damaged listener.
Grant, still determined, persevered, caught
Tom on the left side of the head twice in
succession; exchanges followed in favour of
Grant, and at last Tom got down.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers’ left eye began to show symptoms
of adopting the early closing movement.
He tried to lead off, but was stopped
by Jack, who made his left again on the
closing peeper, and then closed. Sayers
fiddled away at his left ear until both were
down.</p>

<p>     22 and 23.&mdash;&#8203;Both slow but steady, and the
rounds ended, after a few exchanges, in the
men slipping down at the ropes. In the
latter round Grant pursued Sayers, who
ran round the ring until he got to his own
corner, when he turned sharp round, caught
Grant left and right on the nose and left eye,
which led to the close and fall.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Grant came up bleeding from a cut
over his left eye. Sayers attempted to take
the lead, but was well stopped, Grant
making his right heavily on his left ear, and
Sayers fell through the ropes.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers was again neatly stopped, and
in stepping back from Grant’s return, caught
his heel and fell.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Mutual good stopping, Sayers evidently
the more active; he caught Grant
again on his left ear, which was terribly
swollen, received a heavy thump on the ribs
from Grant’s right, and dropped on his south
pole.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Grant dashed in with his left on the
mouth, and then his right on the side of
Sayers’s head. Exchanges&mdash;&#8203;Grant drawing
blood from Tom’s nose. Some good in-fighting
in favour of Sayers, and Grant got
down.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Good counter-hits, each catching it
heavily on the nose. They now went to
work in earnest; the hitting on both sides
was tremendous, but owing to the excellence
of Sayers’s condition, he did not show it
much, while Grant, who received principally
on the left ear and nose, looked considerably
the worse for wear. Eventually Sayers
slipped to avoid Jack’s friendly hug, and
Grant, who fell over him, cleverly avoided
touching him with his spikes.</p>

<p>     29 to 32.&mdash;&#8203;In these rounds Grant led off,
but his want of condition prevented his being
as quick as he otherwise might have been,
consequently he was often stopped, and of
course exhausted himself by throwing away
his blows. When, however, they got at it
he gave as good as he got, and the rounds
ended by Sayers slipping down. In the
32nd, however, Grant threw Sayers, and fell
heavily on him.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;Grant came up bleeding from the
mouth and left ear; he tried to lead off, but
was stopped. Sayers popped in his left and
right on the mouth and throat, getting it in
return on the nose heavily, more of the bark
being displaced, and in the end both were
down.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Grant planted both hands, but the
<a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a><span class="pageno">364</span>
steam was gone; Sayers returned on the
mouth and left eye. A rally, Grant delivering
on the damaged cheek-bone of his adversary,
and receiving another gentle tap on
his nose, which drew more fluid. A close
struggle for the fall, and both down, Sayers
under.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;One hour and a half had now elapsed,
and both appeared fatigued from their exertions.
Grant stopped several well-intentioned
deliveries, and returned on Tom’s
left eye and nose, drawing blood from both.
Good exchanges led to a close, when both
were down.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers came up weak, while Grant
had slightly recovered. The latter led off,
was twice well stopped, but ultimately sent
home his right on Sayers’ left cheek and the
latter slipped down.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers, whose left cheek and eyebrow
were much swollen and discoloured,
led off, and caught Grant on the left eye and
nose, but not heavily, and in retreating fell.</p>

<p>     38.&mdash;&#8203;Grant took the lead, but was propped
in the throat by Tom’s right. Grant,
however, found out the side of his head with
effect. Exchanges followed, both receiving
on the nose; but Sayers, who was the weaker,
got down on the saving suit.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;Grant dashed in with his right on
Tom’s left cheek, who closed, fibbed him
heavily on his damaged ear, and then slipped
down.</p>

<p>     40 to 42.&mdash;&#8203;In these rounds but little mischief
was done, both sparring for wind, and
eventually Sayers got down cleverly.</p>

<p>     43.&mdash;&#8203;Grant, who seemed to have got
second wind, led off quickly, but Sayers
jumped away. Grant followed him up,
caught him on the ribs, heavily with his
right, and then on the nose with his left.
Sayers returned on the throat, and some
heavy deliveries on both sides took place,
both standing and hitting away for some
time without an attempt at stopping, and
there appeared to be no decided advantage
on either side; at length Sayers slipped
down exhausted. This was unexceptionally
the severest round in the fight. The men
appeared to think this was the turning-point,
and each wished to make some decided impression
on his game adversary.</p>

<p>     44.&mdash;&#8203;Both were the worse for the exertions
in the last round. Grant’s left ear
bore marks of having been again severely
visited, and we believe his seconds again
found it necessary to lance it. Sayers did
not show such decided marks of Grant’s
handiwork, but this was mainly accounted
for by his excellent condition. His left eye
was, however, closing, and his left cheek
much swollen. Both unwilling to begin,
and some slight blows having been exchanged,
Sayers slipped down.</p>

<p>     45.&mdash;&#8203;Grant went into mill, but napped
it on the left ear and nose with severity.
Good exchanges followed, and Sayers again
slipped down.</p>

<p>     46.&mdash;&#8203;Grant still first to fight, but was
cleverly stopped by Sayers, who was getting
more active. They quickly got to in-fighting,
when after a few exchanges
they rolled over, and Grant excited the admiration
of all by the careful manner in
which he avoided falling on his man with his
feet or knees.</p>

<p>     47, 48.&mdash;&#8203;Grant took the lead in both these
rounds, but was stopped in each instance,
and received deliveries from Sayers’s right
on his left ear. He nevertheless succeeded
in each round in planting on Sayers’s left ear
with his dangerous right; but the blows
had not that vigour we have seen him exhibit
on former occasions. Both were down in
these rounds.</p>

<p>     49.&mdash;&#8203;Some rattling exchanges took place
in this round; Grant getting it on the throat
and ribs, and Sayers on the chest and mouth
and eventually slipping down.</p>

<p>     50.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers made play on the ribs with
his left heavily, Grant returning on the nose
with his left; Grant then stopped two attempts
on the part of Sayers, made his left
and right on the nose and left cheek, and
Sayers slipped down.</p>

<p>     51.&mdash;&#8203;Grant again popped in a spank on
Tom’s nut, receiving in return on the smeller
heavily, and losing more claret. Good exchanges
followed, when Grant rushed in and
bored his man over the ropes.</p>

<p>     52.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers attempted to make the running,
but was stopped by Grant, who went
in to mill, and planted both hands, one
on the nose and the other on the left side of
the head heavily. Another on the nose succeeded,
which opened the claret jug again.
Sayers only planted his left once on the nose
and slipped down. This round was decidedly
in favour of Grant.</p>

<p>     53.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers made his left on the ribs, and
tried to plant the same hand on the nose,
but was well stopped. He received one
from Grant’s right on the side of his head;
this brought on a rally, in which he caught
it on the eyebrow heavily, and slipped
down.</p>

<p>     54.&mdash;&#8203;Grant, thinking the game was now
his own, again rushed in, but Sayers was
with him and in the exchanges which followed
he visited Grant’s left ear with great
severity, catching it slightly on the side of
the head, and then getting down cunning.</p>

<p>     55.&mdash;&#8203;Grant again first, but stopped; he
however, made good his right on the ribs
directly afterwards, and then his left on the
right eye of Sayers, who sent home his right
on the neck, and his left on the left ear.
Grant bored in again, received one on the
left ear, which bled freely, and Sayers slipped
down.</p>

<p>     56.&mdash;&#8203;A close, and Sayers got down.</p>

<p>     57.&mdash;&#8203;No mischief done. Some slight exchanges,
and Sayers slipped down.</p>

<p>     58.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers caught Grant as he came in
on the nose and throat, and then on the
mazzard heavily, drawing more of the ruby.
<a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a><span class="pageno">365</span>
Grant then closed, struggled, and both fell
heavily to the ground&mdash;&#8203;Sayers uppermost.</p>

<p>     59.&mdash;&#8203;Grant, who seemed weak and exhausted,
was twice stopped; but in a third
attempt caught Sayers on the left ear with
his right, and the latter slipped down.</p>

<p>     60.&mdash;&#8203;Grant led off, reached Sayers’ left
eye, received one on his damaged listener,
and slipped down.</p>

<p>     61.&mdash;&#8203;Grant appeared determined to finish
the matter off hand, rushed in left and right
on Sayers’ cheek and nose. Sayers put in
both hands on the left eye and nose; a rally,
close, and short struggle, both again coming
to the ground heavily&mdash;&#8203;Grant under.</p>

<p>     62.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers tried to lead off, but was
short; Grant just contrived to reach his
nose, but the blow had no steam in it, and
Sayers in getting back slipped down.</p>

<p>     63.&mdash;&#8203;Both slow to the call of time, and both
evidently exhausted. Grant was first up,
but he looked much flushed; his face was
much swollen, his nose anything but Roman
in its appearance, and his left ear presenting
an unpleasant spectacle. He rushed in, but
Sayers, whose good-natured mug still bore
the ghost of a smile, although nearly on the
wrong side of his mouth, stopped him cleverly
and got away; Grant followed him up,
got home with his right on the side of his
head, receiving, in return, on the left ear.
A close, and long struggle for the fall, which
Grant got, throwing his man and falling
on him.</p>

<p>     64 and last.&mdash;&#8203;Grant came up looking very
groggy. The falls in the few last rounds
had evidently shaken him. He appeared to
be suffering from cramp, but still was determined.
He led off, getting slightly home
on Sayers’ left cheek bone. Tom retaliated
on the left ear. A few sharp exchanges
were succeeded by another struggle for the
fall, and ultimately both came very heavily
to the ground&mdash;&#8203;Grant being undermost&mdash;&#8203;Tom
falling across his stomach. Both were
immediately picked up and carried to their
corners, and on time being called, Jemmy
Welsh, on the part of Grant, threw up the
sponge in token of defeat. On our inquiring
as to the cause of this rather unexpected
termination of the affair, we were informed
that Grant was severely suffering from cramp,
and had moreover injured some part of his
intestines in such a manner that it was
feared he was ruptured, and he was in such
pain that he could not stand upright.
Sayers went up to his fallen but not disgraced
adversary and shook him kindly by
the hand, and was proclaimed the victor
amidst the shouts of his friends. Grant
was conveyed on a railway truck to a small
public-house in the neighbourhood, where
every attention was shown to him, but he
continued in great pain for some time afterwards.
The poor fellow was not actually
ruptured; but he had received a severe internal
strain, which caused him considerable
uneasiness for some time. Grant met with
an accident some time before at Manchester,
which always rendered him weak in the
muscles of the stomach, and he considered
that being not fully up to the mark, he was
more than usually susceptible of injury.
The fight lasted exactly <em>two hours and a
half</em>.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;The great length to which
our account of this “model mill” has extended
imposes upon us the necessity of
being brief in our remarks. Tom Sayers by
this victory established for himself a reputation
as a man of science, courage, and endurance,
for which few were disposed to give
him credit. The manner in which he stopped
the determined attacks of his adversary,
and the judgment with which he extricated
himself from difficulty, and continually refused
to struggle for the fall with a man
stronger than himself, proved that his headpiece
was screwed on the right way, and
that although, compared with his opponent,
a novice in the Prize Ring, he was perfectly
acquainted with the theory of his art, and
only wanted the occasion to arise to put
that theory into practice. He proved himself
a very hard hitter, and managed to get
on to his opponent so frequently that even
Grant’s iron mug displayed such bumps and
contusions as the gallant hero has seldom
exhibited in his former engagements. Sayers
is a good-tempered, well-behaved young fellow,
and bears a high character for honour
and integrity. He is by this victory nearly
at the top of the tree, and we trust that by
his future conduct he will show that prosperity
has not, in his case, as it has in many
we could name in his profession, had the
effect of destroying his good principles.
Grant, although not destined on this occasion
to wear the crown of victory, was not
disgraced by his fall. He manfully disputed
every inch of ground with his clever opponent,
and showed that his qualifications as a
sparrer were quite equal to those of Sayers.
His stopping and wrestling were universally
admired, while the manliness and care with
which he avoided falling upon his adversary
in such a way as to cause any dispute, obtained
for him the repeated plaudits of the
surrounding throng. The fight, as we have
before observed, was conducted throughout
in a way to leave nothing to be desired.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Tom now remained idle until January of the following year, 1853, when
a game, resolute fellow, named Jack Martin, who had disposed of several
countrymen, and grown into high favour with Ben Caunt, was brought
<a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a><span class="pageno">366</span>
forward by “Big Ben” to uphold the honour of the “Coach and Horses.”
Tom’s standing challenge was accordingly accepted for £50 a side, and
Wednesday, January 26, 1853, named as the day of battle. A foggy trip
per steamer landed the voyagers in Long Reach, and, the preparations
being made, the men stood up and shook hands; Alec Keene and a friend,
for Sayers, and Tom Paddock and Jerry Noon as seconds for Martin,
joining in the friendly ceremony.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On toeing the scratch it was
clear to all that Sayers was a bigger man
than his adversary; and, if possible, in better
condition. His eye had resumed its
brightness, and there was a hardness in his
general appearance which made him look all
over a perfect gladiator. Martin, who was
shorter in the reach than his opponent,
showed great muscularity of arm and thighs,
but elsewhere he was not nearly so well
furnished. He was pale, but there was a
good-humoured smile on his mug, which
showed that the word fear was unknown in
his vocabulary. Little time was lost in sparring&mdash;&#8203;Sayers
led off, catching Martin slightly
with his left on the nose. Martin immediately
rushed to in-fighting, when some heavy
hits were exchanged, each catching it on
the left eye, and each showing claret at the
same moment from cuts on the brow. After
a few random shots both were down together.
“First blood” was claimed by each
party, but was decided by the referee to be
a drawn event.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Both bleeding from the left eye, Sayers
appearing to have the worst of it. He was
undaunted, smiled, led off with his left,
catching Martin on the right cheek. Martin
again went in, and commenced pegging away
with both hands. Sayers was with him,
hitting with most precision, and the round
ended in both again falling together.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers commenced the ball, caught
Martin a spank on the right cheek, received
slightly on the body, and then catching
Martin full with his left on the nose, sent
him to grass, a clean “knock-down blow,”
and thus won the second event.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Martin came up bleeding from the
nose, but with a smile of confidence. Sayers
led off, but Martin jumped cleverly back.
He then stepped in, caught Sayers on the
damaged optic, drawing more of the ruby.
Heavy exchanges followed; Martin delivered
his right heavily on the ribs, Sayers returning
with effect on the nose. A close at the
rope followed, and both were quickly down.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Martin attempted to take the lead,
but was neatly stopped; he then swung
round his right at the body, and immediately
closed for the fall. Sayers, instead of
struggling, fibbed away at Martin’s head
until Martin forced him down.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers led off on the nose with his
left; Martin countered on the side of the
head. A tremendous rally followed, the hits
on both sides succeeding each other with
great quickness. Each caught it on the side
of the head, but the blows of Sayers, from
his superior reach, told with most force. In
the end both were down.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Martin led off, was well stopped, and received
a nasty one on the nose; he then closed,
but Sayers refused to struggle with him, and
got down, Martin following suit.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers commenced by planting his left
on Martin’s nose with effect, and immediately
repeating the dose. Martin returned
on the left eye heavily, enlarging the old
cut; and Sayers, in stepping away, slipped
down.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Martin showed a bump on each side of
his nose from the heavy blows in the last
round. He tried to take the lead, but was
well stopped. Ditto repeated. After which
he bored in, Sayers catching him heavily on
the left cheek. Martin succeeded in reaching
Sayers’ damaged brow; good exchanges
followed, Sayers getting, however, on Martin’s
right eye, and Martin on the ribs with
his right. Another tremendous rally followed,
each getting heavy pepper, Martin,
however, having the worst of it, and receiving
on the mouth and left eye with great
severity. At last they got close together,
and, after a short struggle, Sayers eased himself
down, and Martin fell on him.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Martin, on coming up, showed marks
of the efficacy of Sayers’ handiwork in the
last round. His right eye, which was previously
“all serene,” was now completely
closed, and his right cheek much swollen,
while Sayers appeared little the worse for
wear. Sayers led off, but was short; Martin
then made an attempt, but failed in like
manner. Counter-hits followed; Sayers again
reached the right ogle of his adversary, who
took all in good-humour, and still smiled
with one side of his face. He now dashed
in, and more exchanges took place, Martin
succeeded in inflicting a cut over Sayers’
right eye, which had been hitherto unscathed.
<a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a><span class="pageno">367</span>
At length, after some sharp in-fighting in
favour of Sayers, Martin slipped down on
one knee. Sayers, who might have hit him,
laughed and walked away, amidst cries of
“Bravo” from both sides.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers led off with his left, reaching
the side of Martin’s nose. A rattling rally
followed, at the end of which Sayers threw
his man, and fell heavily on him.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Martin came up bleeding at all points,
but still the same good-humoured fellow as
ever. Sayers led off short, ditto Martin;
Sayers in on the ribs with his left. Counter-hits,
Sayers on the nose, and Martin on the
cheek, drawing more of the ruby fluid. A
close followed, and some more heavy infighting,
after which, Martin contrived to
swing Sayers over.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers on coming up was bleeding
rapidly from a severe cut on his left hand,
evidently inflicted against Martin’s teeth.
The men quickly got to it, counter-hits were
exchanged, Martin on the ribs, and Sayers
on the right cheek, followed up by two spanks,
left and right, on the nose and mouth. More
heavy pounding in favour of Sayers, who hit
at points, while Martin hit round, and principally
at the body. At length they closed,
and both were down, side by side, each looking
at his adversary and smiling.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Martin led off with his left, but was
out of distance. Sayers, with great quickness,
let go his left, and reached his opponent’s
mouth. Martin merely grinned at the visitation,
bored in, but only to receive another
severe prop on the right eye and a spank on
the nasal organ. Still he was determined,
and again went at his man, who, in getting
away, slipped down.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Martin’s phisog in anything but picturesque
condition, his right cheek much
swollen and bleeding, and his mouth completely
out of kissing condition. After a
few passes, slight counter-hits were exchanged,
Martin getting home on the body,
and Sayers on the left cheek. Martin, not
to be stalled off, rushed in and delivered a
heavy round hit on the ribs with his right;
Sayers was with him, and visited his damaged
smeller with severity. This led to another
good rattling rally, in which Sayers inflicted
more heavy punishment on poor Martin’s
nose and right eye, while Martin only succeeded
in delivering some sounding punches
on his ribs. They broke away, again got at
it ding-dong, and finally, in the close both
were down. Martin apparently as strong on
his legs as his opponent.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Good counter-hits with the left, each
catching the other on the mazzard. Sayers
now stopped one or two attempts on the part
of his adversary very neatly, and returned
heavily on the nozzle. An attempt to repeat
the dose was unsuccessful, Martin quickly
jumping back. Martin came again, and
swung round his left on the ribs, but napped
it again on the nose for his imprudence.
More mutual punching in favour of Sayers
followed, but still Martin’s deliveries were
occasionally severe. A close, in which both
fibbed away hammer-and-tongs. Sayers
reaching Martin’s remaining optic, but not
with sufficient force to put up the shutter,
and Martin drew more claret from his opponent’s
left ogle. A break away, and at it
again, until Martin slipped down on one
knee; Sayers again walking away smiling.
This round, which was one of the best fighting
rounds we have seen for many a day,
elicited universal applause.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Martin came up piping, and rather
slow, but still smiling, as well as his damaged
phiz would allow. He endeavoured to lead
off, but was easily stopped. In a second
attempt he reached Tom’s left cheek, but
Sayers countered him on the left eye heavily,
his superior reach giving him the advantage.
Martin, not to be cowed, popped in a heavy
right-hander on the ribs; received again on
his left eye, and, in retreating, slipped
down.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers let fly his left, but was short;
both appeared fatigued from the quickness
with which they had worked, and sparred a
few seconds for wind. Sayers at length
again led off, and caught Martin on the left
eye, Martin returning on the same suit with
considerable quickness. Both were now
short in their deliveries. Martin at length
bored in and reached Tom’s ribs with his
right. Sayers returned on the right cheek,
and both slipped down.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers again out of distance. He
soon crept closer, however, sent out his left,
was neatly stopped, and cleverly got away
from Martin’s return. Martin followed him
up, caught him on the left cheek, and then
on the body, receiving a nasty one in return
on the left eye. In the close which followed
he succeeded in throwing Sayers heavily,
amidst the cheers of his friends, who did not
think he had so much strength in him.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers led off, caught Martin on the
mouth, was unsuccessful in a second attempt,
and then caught a heavy right-hander on the
ribs. Martin sent out his left and was
stopped, Sayers returning with effect on the
right eye, and then on the left, from which
he drew more claret. Martin, whose head
was much swollen, again planted a rib
bender, closed, and after a short struggle
both were down.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Martin took the lead, but Sayers
jumped away laughing; Martin returned the
grin, and again sent out his left, which was
easily stopped. Sayers once more reached
his adversary’s blind side, and Martin slipped
down weak.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Any odds on Sayers, who was as
fresh as possible. Martin made an effort to
turn the tables, but was stopped several
times; he at length reached Tom’s ribs, and
the latter stepping back, steadied himself,
waited for Martin’s rush, and then sent out
his left with terrific force, caught poor Martin
on the right jaw, and the latter tumbled
<a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a><span class="pageno">368</span>
over on his face apparently out of time. It
was thought all over, and the poor fellow
was carried to his corner, but when time was
called, to the surprise of all he came up for
round</p>

<p>     23, and last.&mdash;&#8203;He was evidently all abroad,
and staggered about the ring. Sayers went
up to him, delivered his left on the right
cheek, and following this with a right-hander
on the nose, down went Martin for the last
time, and Sayers was proclaimed the winner
after fighting 55 <em>minutes</em>. Sayers, although
severely handled about the mug, was still fresh
on his pins; both his eyes were fully open,
and it was evident that, had it been necessary,
he was good for many more rounds.
Martin, on being conveyed to his corner, was
laid upon the ground, and every effort made
to restore consciousness, but it was fully five
minutes before he could be made to understand
what had happened. As soon as possible
he was conveyed on board the steamboat,
and made as comfortable as could be
expected under the circumstances.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;A few more such battles as
that we have just recorded would go far to
restore the fallen fortunes of the Prize Ring.
It was, in truth, as we have styled it above,
a mill of the old school. More punishment
was inflicted in 55 minutes than we have
seen in two hours in any encounter during
the last few years. There was not a single
appeal to the referee, nor was there a single
action on the part of either man throughout
the fight at which the greatest stickler for
fair play could take exception. Both had
evidently made up their minds to a fair and
manly struggle for victory, and their friends
ably supported them in their laudable resolution,
by rigidly abstaining from any interference.
In fact, the only thing at which
we felt inclined to cavil was the manner in
which Jerry Noon seconded the losing man.
A good second always remains quiet until
the round is over, then picks his man up,
carries him to his corner, and cleans him as
tenderly as possible. Roughness, or interference
during the round, only tends to confuse
a man’s ideas and lead him into jeopardy.
As to the merits of the men, there cannot be
two opinions. Martin was clearly overmatched.
He was opposed to a taller, longer
and stronger man, one, moreover, possessing
greater knowledge of the art of self-defence
than himself. That he (Martin) is a game,
resolute fellow no one will deny. A greater
glutton we have seldom seen. He is, also,
an exceedingly fair fighter, scorning to take
the least advantage, and is possessed of that
greatest of all requisites to a boxer&mdash;&#8203;unwavering
good-temper. The terms of praise in
which he was mentioned by all clearly
showed that his conduct was appreciated as
it deserved to be. Of Tom Sayers, and his
manly, good-tempered style of fighting, we
have before spoken in the highest terms, and
it is only necessary for us to state that his
conduct was as upright and his tactics were
as fair as ever. He, on several occasions,
refrained from punishing his adversary when
he was down on one knee only&mdash;&#8203;a position
in which he was perfectly entitled to strike
him, and one in which he might have administered
pepper with effect. He used his
left hand with greater precision than in his
battle with Grant, and his deliveries appeared
altogether heavier than in that encounter.
As we have before observed, the
ring was exceedingly well kept throughout,
and all had an uninterrupted view of the
encounter from its commencement to its conclusion.
As soon as possible after the event
was decided, the crowd that had assembled
took its departure&mdash;&#8203;some returning by the
boat, while others, who did not fancy a return
trip up the river in the dark against
an ebb-tide, struck across the marshes to
Dartford, and thus reached town at seven
o’clock by the North Kent Railway. Among
the latter was our eccentric friend, Bendigo,
who quite put out the pipe of the milling
orator and poet, Charley Mallett, as, while
waiting at the station, he composed and sung
a long extempore poem, descriptive of the
day’s sport, and laudatory of the heroes and of
himself, which elicited uncontrollable laughter
and applause from his Corinthian auditors,
and sent all back to the Metropolis in
perfect good humour, caused as much by the
ready wit and “hanky-panky” performances
of that eccentric individual, as by the extraordinary
treat they had enjoyed on the field
of battle.</p>

<p>The year 1853 was not to expire without witnessing the first and last
defeat of the gallant Tom.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Langham, for many years known as “mine host” of the
“Mitre,” in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s Lane, Leicester Square, whose biography illustrates
a former portion of this volume, was, as the reader is already aware,
of that unlucky weight, 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, which is so difficult to match when accompanied
by first-class pugilistic capabilities. Too heavy for the light men,
whose average lies between 9<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> and 9<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, and too light for real
<a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a><span class="pageno">369</span>
“big-uns,” provided they possess skill and pluck, men of this size can find
fair competitors only among men of their own weight and inches. Nat’s
earlier combats, therefore, as we have already seen, were with heavy men;
and his only defeat had been by Harry Orme, his superior by more than
half a stone, under circumstances fully detailed at page 244 of this volume.
Two years had elapsed since Nat’s defeat, and public talk had prophesied in
fistic circles of “the coming man” in the person of the conqueror of Jack
Grant. “Ould Nat,” who seemed for the moment laid on the shelf,
pricked up his ears when he heard that Tom, whose motto was “Excelsior,”
was ready to make a match with the “Champion of the Middle-weights.”
Nat picked up the gauntlet, and all was soon arranged. At Lakenheath,
Suffolk, on the 18th October, 1853, they met, with the result already
recorded.</p>

<p>Defeated, but not disgraced, Tom lost no time in challenging Langham
to a second trial; but the latter, for good and sufficient reasons, which we
have fully set forth in our memoir of that boxer (<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span> <a href="#Page_251"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 251</a>), declined the
invitation.</p>

<p>Sayers was, therefore, on the look-out for a new competitor, and although
Tom “proposed” to several of the provincial “ten stunners” and upwards,
none listened to his suit.</p>

<p>One evening, after some “chaff,” George Sims, a long-limbed professor
of the art, immensely fancied by some of the “locals,” threw down the
gauntlet to Tom, professing regret that £25 was all he could raise for the
experiment, and that Tom could easily post £50. Finding that the professor
was serious and “meant business,” Sayers, who declared himself
“blue mouldy for want of a bating,” accepted the chance, as he said, “to
keep his hand in.”</p>

<p>The day fixed was the 2nd of February, 1854, and on a miserably foggy
morning the principals and their friends took steamer to Long Reach, below
Gravesend, and soon were face to face, near the river wall. Sayers, who
weighed 10st 6<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, looked remarkably well. Sims, who stood over him,
was 5 feet 10 inches, and said to be under 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> We doubt if he were so light,
despite his leanness. Sims was waited upon by Jemmy Welsh and Harry
Orme, so that he had talent behind him; Sayers had Jemmy Massey and
Bob Fuller as counsel. 7 to 4 and 2 to 1 on Sayers.
</p>
<a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a><span class="pageno">370</span>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Sims was so much taller than
Sayers that he seemed quite a lath before
him, and, as soon as he held up his hands,
displayed such awkwardness that it was
evidently “sovereigns to sassingers” on
Sayers, and Dan Dismore immediately
offered 4 to 1 on him, which was taken by
Jem Burn on the off chance. Sims, after a
little unartistic squaring, lunged out awkwardly,
and caught Tom on the chest with
his left. Tom, who was evidently waiting to
find out what his adversary could do, returned
smartly on the mouth, and in getting
back fell on his corybungus.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Tom grinned, dodged his man, and, on
the latter wildly sending out his left,
countered him on the nozzle heavily. Sims
immediately closed, and Tom, seizing him
round the neck, pegged away with his right
at the ribs and left eye until both fell.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Sims led off, evidently without any
settled plan; he caught Tom slightly on the
mouth, and the latter again countered him
heavily on the nose, deciding the first event
in his favour by producing an excellent
supply of the best crimson dye. Sims did
not like this, and again closed, when Tom
fibbed him heavily on the proboscis, drawing
more of the ruby, and then on the left eye,
and both again fell.</p>

<p>     4th and last.&mdash;&#8203;Sims on coming up looked
much flushed; his left ogle winked again as
if it saw so many bright stars as to be perfectly
dazzled. He attempted to lead off,
but was countered with the greatest ease by
Tom on the left eye and mouth. He retreated
as if bothered, and then went in again, when
Tom let go both hands, the left on the
smeller, and the right with terrific effect
over the left brow, inflicting a deep cut, and
drawing a copious supply of the best double-distilled.
Sims was evidently stunned by
the hit; for, as Sayers caught hold of him,
he fell back and rolled over him. It was
at once perceptible that it was all over; poor
Sims lay perfectly insensible and motionless.
His seconds did their best to stop the leak
in his <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">os frontis</span>, but for some time without
effect; and, as for rendering him capable of
hearing the call of “Time,” that was quite
out of the question, and Tom Sayers, to his
own astonishment and the disappointment
of those who had expected a rattling mill,
was declared the conqueror, after a skirmish
of exactly five minutes. Sayers was so
bewildered that he could not make it out;
he evidently did not know he had made so
decided a hit, and displayed considerable
anxiety to ascertain the fate of his less fortunate
opponent. A medical gentleman was
present, who soon did the needful for the
poor fellow, and in about five minutes more
he was himself again, and was able to walk
about. He was quite dumbfounded as to
the result, and expressed a strong wish to be
thrown into the river; but, after some persuasion
from his friends, became more calm,
and thought it better “to live to fight
another day.”</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;A few words are all that are
called for in the shape of remarks on this
mill. Sims was from the first overmatched.
He is a civil, well-behaved, courageous
fellow, ridiculously over estimated by his
friends. Tom Sayers and his tactics are
too well known to require comment. He
did all that was required of him, and left
the ring without a scratch. We never saw
him in better fettle; and if he ever had a
day on which he was better than he ever had
been before, that day was Tuesday. An
easier job never fell to man’s lot; and the
best wish that his friends can express is,
that he may never have a worse.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>This brief episode left Sayers literally without a chance of continuing the
main story of his battles, of which this could be hardly reckoned more than
“<span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un affaire</span>,” as French <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">militaires</span> would call it. Tom looked round and round,
he sparred, and challenged, and travelled, but he was not fancied as a
customer by either Londoners or provincials. He was too good a horse,
and handicapping him was not so easy. There was much “talkee, talkee”
about a match between himself and Tom Paddock, then claiming the
Championship, and a proposal for Paddock to stake £200 to Tom Sayers’s
£100, Paddock weighing 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> to Tom’s 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 1<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, or thereabouts.
It came to nothing, however; and Tom, in despair, announced his intention
of going to Australia.</p>

<p>Harry Poulson, of Nottingham, whose three tremendous battles with
<a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a><span class="pageno">371</span>
Paddock, in the first of which he was victorious, though defeated in the
second and third encounters, had raised his fame deservedly, was now
talked of, and Tom was induced to match himself against him. Here,
again, Sayers was giving away “lumps of weight;” for Poulson, though
an inch shorter than Sayers (namely, 5<abbr title="foot">ft</abbr> 7½<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr>) was a perfect Hercules
in the torso, weighing 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> in hard condition. He had thrashed, in
provincial battles, all comers, and was known as one of the coolest, most
determined, and game fellows that ever pulled off a shirt. True, he had
come into the London Ring rather late in life, having been born in 1817,
but his endurance and strength were considered an overmatch for Sayers.
So, too, thought Jem Burn, a staunch friend of Poulson, and he proposed
to stake £50 on his behalf. Sayers accepted it, and Bendigo, who was
Poulson’s friend and adviser, snapped at what he declared to be “a gift”
for his townsman Harry.</p>

<p>Many of Tom’s friends were displeased with the match, which they considered
presumptuous on his part, and declared that he was completely overmatched,
as it was known Poulson could not fight under 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, and Sayers to
be well ought to be more than a stone under that amount. At first he had
some difficulty in finding supporters, but that was happily got over by the
influence of one of the staunchest Corinthian fanciers of modern times.
After he was matched, Sayers remained longer in town than was prudent,
and, as a natural consequence, was too much hurried in his preparations.
He was not quite a month at country quarters, and on arriving in London
looked fleshy, and had evidently done insufficient work. Had he been
about five pounds lighter he would have been all the better. He was,
nevertheless, extremely sanguine of success, and assured his backers that
he would fully justify the confidence they had placed in him. We saw
Tom at Nat Langham’s, the “Cambrian,” on the Monday evening. He
was surrounded by an extensive circle of the upper-crust supporters of the
<abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> His weight was about 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 12<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> or 13<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr></p>

<p>Poulson, after his last defeat by Paddock, had remained at Nottingham,
where he followed his laborious occupation as a navvy until informed of
the proposed match, in which, as already stated, he was taken in hand by
Jem Burn. That facetious worthy, determined that no pains should be
spared, summoned Bendigo to his assistance, and under the able tutelage
of that eccentric but painstaking ex-champion did Harry get himself into
very first-rate trim. Every muscle in his powerful frame was beautifully
developed, and there did not seem to be an ounce of superfluous meat in
<a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a><span class="pageno">372</span>
any place. As the men were not tied to weight, no scaling took place at
the last moment on which dependence could be placed. He was certainly not
less than 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, and might have been a pound or so more. His height
5<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> 7½<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr>, and in figure and general appearance, although shorter and
thicker set, marvellously like “the renowned” Bendigo. On the Monday
before the battle Poulson took up his quarters under the hospitable roof of
“My Nevvy,” at the “Rising Sun,” where he was greeted by an admiring
circle, including many patricians. He retired to his “flea pasture” at an
early hour; but the eccentric Bendy kept the company at the “Rising
Sun” in a perpetual grin until the approach of the small hours reminded
him that he, too, had work to do early in the morning, upon which he
retired to roost, as did the host himself, who, although suffering from
gout, had made up his mind to be present. The betting, at both Jem’s and
Nat’s, varied between 6 and 7 to 4 on Poulson&mdash;&#8203;odds which the superior
strength, weight, and condition of the countryman fully justified. The
betting was tolerably brisk, but there were more layers of odds than
takers.</p>

<p>By six o’clock in the morning all the Fancy were astir, and great was
the difficulty in getting cabs. A hard frost had set in, and most of the
vehicles were detained at home to get the horses “roughed.” Several,
owing to this unforeseen occurrence, were unable to catch the train at
eight o’clock; and, had it not been for the opportune arrival of the drag
of an old friend, Sayers would, in all probability, have been left behind.
As it was, he cut it so fine that he only arrived as the station-doors were
closed. The journey down was performed by eleven o’clock, and within
half an hour the ring was ready at Appledore. The men lost no time in
entering its precincts, Poulson attended by Bob Fuller and Bendigo, and
Sayers receiving the friendly assistance of Nat Langham and Jemmy
Massey. Umpires and a referee were soon appointed, and at six minutes to
twelve the men toed the scratch. The betting now was tolerably brisk at
7 to 4 on Poulson&mdash;&#8203;odds which, at one period of the fight, advanced
to 3 to 1, which was laid by Tom Paddock, whose confidence in his
old opponent’s tried game and resolution tempted him to overstep the
bounds of prudence in his investments.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;The disparity in weight was
very perceptible, as was also the superior
condition of Poulson. Sayers, however, had
the advantage in height and length. Poulson
threw himself into the old-fashioned
attitude, with both hands held somewhat
high, and planted firmly on both pins.
Sayers, on the contrary, assumed an elegant
<a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a><span class="pageno">373</span>
position, resting most upon his left foot, his
right arm across the mark, and the left well
down. He fiddled a little, until Poulson
went in and let go his left and right. The
former was stopped; but with the latter he
got home on Tom’s nut. A sharp rally
instantly took place, which brought them
to close quarters, in which Sayers fibbed his
man very cleverly, catching him heavily on
the conk, and in the end both were down,
Poulson under.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Both were flushed from the rapid in-fighting
in the last round, which had
evidently been severe. Poulson tried to
lead off, but was too slow for his active
opponent. He persevered, and at last got
home with his right over Tom’s left ear.
This led to more heavy exchanges and a
close, in which Poulson caught Sayers round
the neck. Sayers hit up, but without doing
any damage, and in the end was down,
Poulson on him.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers came up smiling but cautious.
He fiddled his man until he got within distance,
when he lunged out his left on the
right brow, but too high for mischief. Poulson
returned heavily on the ribs with his
right, when Tom retreated. Poulson followed
him again, let go his left and right,
was beautifully countered, but again too
high and on the side of the nut, and Poulson
slipped down.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers feinted and let go his left on
the nose, but not heavily. Poulson was wild
and missed his return, whereupon Sayers
put in his left very neatly on the right
cheek. Poulson now went in ding-dong, but
his blows wanted precision. He got close,
when Sayers caught him on the right peeper
and the right lug, from each of which there
was a tinge of blood. Tom then closed and
threw his man very neatly, falling on
him. (“First blood” for Sayers.)</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers again feinted to draw his man,
who came in, and Sayers sent his left over
his shoulder. Poulson then closed, threw,
and fell on him.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, after one or two feints and
dodges, again let fly his left, but was well
stopped. Poulson, however, missed his
return with the right at the body. He now
rushed in determined, and some tremendous
punching, left and right, ensued, in which
Sayers hit straighter and oftener, but Poulson
heavier with his right, which paid some
heavy visits to Tom’s nut.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers again feinted and succeeded in
drawing his man, who let go both hands, but
out of distance. Sayers with quickness
returned on the forehead, but was too high.
Heavy counter-hits followed to a close, in
which the fibbing was severe, Sayers receiving
on the left side of his head and returning
on the mouth.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Both, much flushed on the dial, came
up laughing. Poulson lunged out his right,
catching Tom heavily on the ribs and then
on the cheek, Tom instantly closed, and,
after a sharp struggle, in which it was
thought Poulson had the best of it, Sayers
cleverly back-heeled him, throwing him
heavily and falling on him.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson tried again to deliver his
right on the ribs, but Sayers was well away.
Harry rushed after him, slinging out both
hands, when Tom ducked and escaped.
Poulson persevered, and at last caught him
with his right on the ribs, when some more
severe in-fighting in favour of Poulson took
place. In the end both were down.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;On coming up Tom’s nose showed
that Harry had been there in the last round;
his ribs, also, were unmistakably bruised.
He feinted to draw his adversary, and let
go his left, which was stopped, and Poulson
returned on the ribs. Sayers, with great
quickness, countered him as he delivered
this blow, and sent him to grass by a sharp
left-hander on the right temple. (“First
knock-down blow” for Sayers.)</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson came up slow, as if posed by
the blow in the last round. Sayers dodged
with his left, and popped it over Harry’s
right peeper, getting quickly away from the
return. Poulson followed him up, but
missed his right; he persevered until they
got to close quarters, when Sayers again
knocked him down by a heavy right-hander
on the jaw. (Loud cheers for Sayers, the
Poulsonites looking blue.)</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Tom came up smiling and all alive,
dodged, and put in his left very straight on
Harry’s nasal promontory. Poulson instantly
rushed in, but napped it on the right
side of his nut and slipped down.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson, who had been called on to
fight with his left, waited for Sayers, and,
on the latter coming near, caught him
heavily with that hand on the proboscis,
staggering him. Tom soon came again, and
retaliated by a heavy delivery on the mouth
with his left. After some mutual sparring,
Harry was short with his left, and Tom
countered him with the right on the left
peeper, and then with the left bang on the
olfactory organ. Some sharp exchanges
ensued, in which Poulson drew the ruby
from Tom’s snout, and Tom slipped down.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Both got quickly to work. No stopping;
and, after one or two harmless cracks,
Sayers got down.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson again attempted to fight with
his left; but Sayers was too quick for him,
and nailed him on the right cheek. Harry
tried it again, but was stopped; and Sayers
then let drive with his left on the smelling-bottle
very heavily; he retreated, feinted,
and, by putting the double on, succeeded
in delivering another smack on the same
organ. Some very heavy exchanges followed,
in which Sayers got home on the
right eye and Harry on the sneezer; Sayers
slipped down.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Tom came up filtering the juice from
his beak. Poulson tried to plant his
favourite right, but was stopped. He then
<a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a><span class="pageno">374</span>
tried his left, but was out of distance. After
several more wild efforts, Sayers caught him
with his left heavily on the right cheek, and
retreated. Poulson followed him to the
corner and let go his left and right, when
Sayers countered him on the cheek. Poulson
retaliated on the mouth very heavily,
and Tom slipped down.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Tom was now bleeding from the
mouth and nose. He was as steady as ever,
and planted his left on the side of the head.
This led to some sharp in-fighting, without
material damage, and in the end Sayers
slipped down, tired.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson bored in, let go his left,
which was stopped, and Sayers was out of
distance with his return. The same thing
was repeated on both sides; but, on their
getting closer, some good counter-hits were
exchanged, Poulson getting it on the jaw
and Tom on the damaged nose. Tom
retreated, followed by Harry, who let go
both hands, but was prettily popped on the
nozzle. Some more sharp exchanges followed,
Tom getting it heavily on the left
eye, and in the end Tom was down.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Tom’s left peeper showed signs of
closing. Poulson, seeing this, bored in, but
was propped on the forehead and cheek.
He persevered, when Tom succeeded in planting
a very straight nose-ender, which removed
the bark from Harry’s proboscis.
The force of his own blow staggered Tom,
who slipped down.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;The gnomon of Harry’s dial was by
no means set straight by these visitations.
He tried his dangerous right at the body,
but missed. Sayers nailed him again on the
snout, and got down.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Tom again put in his favourite double
on Harry’s <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">os frontis</span> and nose, and, on
receiving Poulson’s right on the ribs, fell.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Harry, in his usual style, lunged out
his right at the body, but was short; Tom
returning on the right peeper, and getting
cleverly away. Poulson followed him up,
and, after innocuous exchanges, Sayers went
down.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson again led off, but was
propped neatly on the forehead and nose.
This led to sharp counter-hitting in favour
of Poulson, and Sayers was again down.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Tom tried his double and got home
his left on the frontal bone, to the detriment
of his knuckles, and again too high to be
effective. Poulson pegged away at the ribs
and the side of his head very heavily, the
latter blow knocking Tom off his pins.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Tom seemed much fatigued; he
nevertheless led off, but without effect.
Poulson tried to return, when Tom met him
on the nose with his left, and then on the
forehead. Poulson once more reached Tom’s
nose with his right, and Tom was down.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Harry tried his left, and succeeded
in reaching Tom’s right peeper, but not
heavily. Tom returned on the forehead,
and then delivered his left on the snout.
He retreated to draw his man, and as he
came caught him a tremendous spank on
the potato-trap with his right, but in retreating
caught his foot against the stake
and fell.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Harry’s mouth much swollen from
the hit in the last round. He rushed in,
when Tom caught him on the nasal organ
heavily with his left, and got away. Poulson
now tried his left, but was short; and
Sayers caught him once more on the lips,
renewing the supply of carmine. Poulson
rushed after him, and Tom in getting away
again caught against the stake and fell
heavily.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Tom smiling, dodged and popped in
his left on the mouth, and then on the nose
with great quickness, drawing more gravy.
Poulson rushed after him, but missed his
right; some slogging punches followed on
both sides to a close, in which both fell,
Sayers under.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;They immediately closed, and after
some sharp fibbing, in which Sayers was the
quicker and straighter, both were again
down. One hour had now elapsed.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;Tom led off, and again reached
Harry’s nose. It was a long shot, and not
heavy. Poulson missed his return, whereupon
Sayers planted his left twice in succession
on the nose, and, after receiving a little
one on the chest, slipped down.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson led off with his left, but was
stopped, and Sayers was short in his return.
Harry then missed his right on the ribs, and
napped a hot one on the kisser from Tom’s
left. This visitation Tom repeated, and
then got on Harry’s nose. Harry rushed at
him, and Tom slipped down, the ground
being in a dreadful state.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers feinted and again got well on
the mug and nose with his left, and Harry
was short with his return. Tom drew him,
and as he came got home on the right eye.
Harry now reached his left cheek heavily,
and Tom got down.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;Tom planted his left slightly on the
dexter ogle, and then in the mazzard, getting
cleverly away from the return. Poulson
followed him up and delivered another
terrific smack with his right on the nose,
drawing a fresh supply of the sap. A close
followed, in which Tom slipped down,
bleeding from his proboscis.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson tried both mauleys, but was
short. He then rushed in again, missed,
and Tom, in getting back, fell. He was
evidently weak, and it was now that Paddock
laid 3 to 1, thinking, no doubt, that
Poulson, who from his fine condition showed
scarcely a mark, would tire him out.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson went to work, missed his
left, but caught Tom with his right on the
larboard cheek, which was much swollen,
and in the close which followed Tom was
down.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;Tom led off with his left on the nose,
but not heavily. Harry returned on the
<a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a><span class="pageno">375</span>
nose and the side of his head, and Tom
slipped down.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;Harry let go, and planted his right
on the nose. Exchanges followed in favour
of Poulson, and Sayers got down.</p>

<p>     38.&mdash;&#8203;Tom collected himself, waited for his
man, and nailed him twice in succession on
the right eye. Slight exchanges followed,
and they fell opposite to one another on
their knees, the ground being more slippery
than ever, and their spikes almost useless.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;Tom dodged, put in his left and
right on Harry’s optics; the latter then
went to work, and some heavy exchanges
ensued in favour of Poulson who nailed
Tom with effect on the left eye, and Tom
fell. His left eye was nearly closed.</p>

<p>     40.&mdash;&#8203;Tom still took the lead, caught
Harry on the snuffbox heavily, and in
retreating slipped down.</p>

<p>     41.&mdash;&#8203;Tom busy with the left on the right
eye, and then on the mouth. Poulson
returned heavily on the left goggle, and then
bored Tom down through the ropes, his left
daylight being quite extinguished.</p>

<p>     42.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers tried his left on the mouth,
but was stopped, and Poulson dashed in,
nailed him with the right on the mouth,
closed, and fibbed him until Tom was down.</p>

<p>     43.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, although evidently tired, came
up smiling, feinted, and let go his left on
the right cheek. Poulson dashed in, when
Tom met him heavily over the left eyebrow.
Poulson still followed him as he retreated,
and Tom nailed him on the nose. In the
end Tom got down in his corner.</p>

<p>     44.&mdash;&#8203;Tom “put his double on,” but it
wanted steam. Poulson then bored in,
closed at the ropes, and, after a short
struggle, both were down.</p>

<p>     45.&mdash;&#8203;On getting close, some heavy counter-hitting
took place, Tom getting on to the
right peeper, and Poulson on the mouth,
renewing the supply of crimson. Tom
retreated, came again and caught his man
on the temple, and then on the mouth.
Poulson returned on the latter organ and
ribs with his right.</p>

<p>     46.&mdash;&#8203;The left side of Tom’s nut was much
swollen, and his nose all shapes but the
right. He came up undaunted, let go his
left well on the right ogle, which at last
began to show signs of a shut-up. Tom
retreated, followed by Poulson, and as the
latter let go his right, Tom countered him
bang on the right eye. Poulson returned
slightly on the nose.</p>

<p>     47.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers once more tried his double
with effect, and got on the right eye. Poulson
rushed after him, when Tom slipped
down in rather a questionable manner, but
there was no appeal.</p>

<p>     48.&mdash;&#8203;Tom crept in and popped his left on
the nose. A close followed, in which Tom
got down on the saving suit.</p>

<p>     49.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson tried to take the lead, but
was too slow for the nimble Tom, who got
quickly away. Harry persevered, and got
well on the ribs twice in succession very
heavily.</p>

<p>     50.&mdash;&#8203;Tom evidently felt the effects of the
visitations to the ribs, for his left arm
certainly did not come up with the same freedom
as before. Poulson went in, delivered
another rib-bender, and Tom got down.</p>

<p>     51.&mdash;&#8203;Harry tried to improve his advantage;
but Sayers propped him beautifully
on the nose, received another little one on
the ribs, and dropped.</p>

<p>     52.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson once more swung out his
right; but Tom got away, and, as Harry
followed, planted his left on the smeller.
Poulson then bored him down, and falling
himself, carefully avoided dropping on
Sayers by placing a knee on each side of
him. This manly forbearance on the part
of Poulson elicited loud applause on all
sides, the more particularly as it was not
the first time during the fight.</p>

<p>     53.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson again let go his left and
right, but Tom was away, planting his left
on the jaw as Harry came after him. Poulson
succeeded in delivering his right slightly
on the cheek, and Sayers got down.</p>

<p>     54.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson led off left and right, but
was stopped, and he, in turn, stopped Tom’s
attempted deliveries. Tom then made his
left on the throat and mouth by one of his
clever doubles, and, after napping a little
one on the proboscis, dropped.</p>

<p>     55.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson popped his right on Tom’s
damaged peeper, and then on the jaw very
heavily. Heavy exchanges followed, each
getting it on the side of the cranium, and
in the end Sayers was down.</p>

<p>     56.&mdash;&#8203;Tom feinted, put his double on the
mouth and throat, and, as Poulson followed
him up, he took advantage of a slight hit to
go down.</p>

<p>     57.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson dashed his right on the left
cheek, and Tom was again down, evidently
requiring rest.</p>

<p>     58.&mdash;&#8203;Harry got well on to Tom’s conk
with his right, and then with his left, and
Tom dropped.</p>

<p>     59.&mdash;&#8203;Harry again led off, but the blow
was of no effect; he followed it by another
on the nose, and a third on the side of the
head, and Tom went to earth.</p>

<p>     60.&mdash;&#8203;Harry made his left and right, but
they were very slight, and Tom got down.</p>

<p>     61.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers was now recovering his wind,
and, waiting for his man, countered him
very straight on the right eyebrow as he
came in, inflicting a cut, and drawing the
carmine. Exchanges in favour of Sayers
followed, who again caught his man over the
right peeper, and, in the end, Tom got
down, the Poulson party asking why he did
not stand up, and claiming a foul, which
was not allowed, there being no ground for
it.</p>

<p>     62.&mdash;&#8203;Tom led off, but missed, and napped
a heavy smack on the whistler from Poulson’s
left. On getting close, a tremendous
counter-hit with the right was exchanged,
Sayers getting it on the jaw, and Poulson
<a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a><span class="pageno">376</span>
on the right eye, each knocking his adversary
down.</p>

<p>     63.&mdash;&#8203;Both slow to time, the counter in the
last round having been a shaker for each.
Poulson was bleeding from the right ogle,
and Tom from the mouth. Tom again got
on to Harry’s right eye, and, on getting a
little one on the mouth, once more fell.</p>

<p>     64.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, again very weak and tired,
waited for his man, caught him slightly on
the left cheek, and slipped down. Another
claim that he went down without a blow
disallowed, the ground being very bad; the
referee, however, cautioned him to be
careful.</p>

<p>     65.&mdash;&#8203;Tom tried his left, which was easily
stopped, and Poulson nailed him on the
mouth. A close and fibbing followed, when
Tom, having all the worst of this game, got
down.</p>

<p>     66.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson led off with his right, which
was stopped, and Sayers missed his return;
Poulson then caught him a little one with
his right on the side of his nut, and Tom,
glad of the excuse, got down.</p>

<p>     67.&mdash;&#8203;Harry tried his left, and succeeded
in reaching Tom’s right cheek. Heavy
counter-hits followed, Poulson on the nose,
and Tom on the left cheek; and Tom, in
turning, after getting another crack on the
side of his occiput, dropped.</p>

<p>     68.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson dashed out his left, but
Sayers got cleverly away. He tried it again
with the same result, and on making a third
essay, Tom countered him well off on the
right ogle. He then made his left twice on
the left eye, and, as Poulson rushed at him,
got down. Two hours had now passed, and
the punishment was pretty equally divided.
Poulson’s right eye, like Tom’s left, was completely
closed, and each of their noses was
much out of shape. The right side of Tom’s
face was unscathed, but his ribs bore heavy
marks of punishment. Poulson had a
mouse under his left eye, but was much
stronger on his legs than Sayers, and it was
still thought he must wear him out. Many
also imagined that, as Tom was getting
slower, Poulson would knock him out of
time with his dangerous right.</p>

<p>     69.&mdash;&#8203;Tom tried to lead off with his left,
but was stopped twice in succession, and
Poulson nailed him on the snorer. Tom
returned the compliment by a tidy smack
with his right on the mouth, drawing more
of the cochineal; slight exchanges followed,
and Sayers got down.</p>

<p>     70.&mdash;&#8203;Tom’s left was again stopped, and
Harry was short in his return. Tom then
feinted and popped his double on the nose
and right cheek, which he cut slightly.</p>

<p>     71.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson let go his left, but did not
get home. On Sayers attempting to return,
Harry popped him on the nose, and Tom
got down.</p>

<p>     72.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson’s left was stopped easily;
he then tried a one, two, and reached Tom’s
mouth with his right; the left, however,
did not reach its destination (the unscathed
side of Tom’s phisog). In the end Tom got
down.</p>

<p>     73.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers stopped Poulson’s one, two,
and then got home on the right eye. Poulson
returned on the chin. Some rapid exchanges
followed, Tom making both hands
on the mouth and left cheek, and Poulson
getting in on Tom’s nose. Poulson closed,
when Tom caught him heavily on the mouth,
and Poulson got down.</p>

<p>     74.&mdash;&#8203;Tom put in a well-delivered left-hander
on the damaged peeper. Slight exchanges
followed, and Tom got down.</p>

<p>     75.&mdash;&#8203;Tom getting more lively every
round, and Poulson’s head at last beginning
to swell. Tom let go his left on the throat;
good counter-hits followed, Poulson on
the mouth, and Tom on the side of the head.
Poulson then dashed in with his right on
the ribs, leaving marks of his knuckles.
Tom retaliated on the right eye, and a
determined rally followed, in which each
got pepper; but Sayers was straighter in
his deliveries. In the end he was down.
The Poulson party began now to look
serious; their man was gradually going
blind of both eyes, and Sayers appeared to
be no weaker than he was an hour ago,
added to which he had still a good eye.</p>

<p>     76.&mdash;&#8203;Both came up piping from the effects
of the last round. Poulson tried his left
twice, but Sayers got away, and, as Harry
came after him, met him well on the mouth,
and then on the right eye, and in the end
both fell side by side.</p>

<p>     77.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers came up smiling as well as
his distorted mug would allow; he dodged,
and then got well over Poulson’s guard on to
his left eye. Harry instantly returned on
the chin, when Tom once more popped his
left on the mouth heavily, and got away.
He played round his man and at last sent
home another left-hander on the left eye&mdash;&#8203;a
cross hit. Poulson just reached his jaw
with his right, and Tom got down.</p>

<p>     78.&mdash;&#8203;Tom made play with his left on the
right ogle, and avoided the return. Poulson
persevered, and at last Tom got down in
his corner.</p>

<p>     79.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson dashed in his right on the
nose, but not very heavily; Sayers returned
on the right gazer, and napped a heavy
right-hander on the cheek, from the effect
of which he went down weak.</p>

<p>     80.&mdash;&#8203;Tom steadied himself, crept close,
and popped his left on the left eye. Poulson
rushed at him, and heavy counter-hits
were exchanged on the jaw, both coming to
the ground side by side.</p>

<p>     81.&mdash;&#8203;Tom missed two attempts to deliver,
and received another heavy thwack on the
bread-basket. Heavy exchanges ensued in
favour of Poulson, who was always best at
close quarters, and Sayers got down.</p>

<p>     82.&mdash;&#8203;Tom came up a little stronger, and
let go his left, but not heavily, on the right
cheek. Poulson tried a return, but Tom,
who gradually retreated, propped him as he
<a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a><span class="pageno">377</span>
came in, on the right eye and nose. Poulson,
determined if possible, to make a decided
turn in his favour, persevered, and some
rattling ding-dong fighting took place, each
getting it heavily on the dial, and in the end
both were down.</p>

<p>     83.&mdash;&#8203;Both looked the worse for the
last round, but Poulson’s left eye was fast
following suit with his right, and it was
evident to all that if Sayers kept away it
was a mere question of time. Sayers
feinted, put in his double very neatly on
the mouth, and then got a hot one on the
left cheek. Good exchanges at close quarters
followed, in which Poulson’s visitations
to Tom’s snout were anything but agreeable,
while Tom was busy on the right eye.
This was another ding-dong round, and
astonished every one after the men had
fought so long. In the end Sayers got
down, and Poulson fell on his knees at his
side.</p>

<p>     84.&mdash;&#8203;Tom’s double was once more successful,
and he got well on Harry’s smeller.
Poulson once more reached the left side of
the nut, just by the ear, and Tom fell.</p>

<p>     85.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson led off with his left, getting
well on Tom’s nose. Good counter-hits
followed, Tom getting it on the mouth, and
Harry on the left eye. Poulson now dashed
in, but got one on the right eye; he, however,
nailed Tom on the right ear, drawing
claret. Another desperate rally followed,
in which Jack was as good as his master,
and in the end Sayers got down. Two
hours and thirty minutes had now elapsed.</p>

<p>     86.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson dashed in, but Sayers stepped
nimbly back, propping him as he came
on the left eye. Harry at last made his
right on the left ear, and Tom got down.</p>

<p>     87.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson again rushed in, but Sayers,
after propping him over the right eye,
dropped. Another claim of foul not allowed.</p>

<p>     88.&mdash;&#8203;Tom tried his left, but was short;
Poulson then rattled in, caught him on the
left side of his knowledge-box, and Tom
dropped.</p>

<p>     89.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson, after being short with his
one, two, made his right on the ribs, and
Tom fell.</p>

<p>     90.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson again hit out of distance;
he persevered, and eventually nailed Tom
slightly on the nozzle, and that hero wisely
got down, by way of a rest, finding that
Harry was still dangerous at close quarters.</p>

<p>     91.&mdash;&#8203;Tom stopped Harry with great neatness,
and then planted his left on the throat;
heavy exchanges followed in favour of
Poulson, who again reached Tom’s left
ear very severely, drawing more of the
Burgundy, and Tom fell very weak.</p>

<p>     92.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, who staggered up, received a
heavy one from Harry’s right on the brow,
and got down.</p>

<p>     93.&mdash;&#8203;Neither very ready at the call of
“Time,” but Tom slowest; he nevertheless
came up steady, and, as Poulson rushed in,
planted his left very heavily, first on the
right eye and then on the nose, and got
away, followed by Poulson, who forced the
fighting. Heavy exchanges followed, Harry
on the ribs and Tom on the forehead, and
Tom down.</p>

<p>     94.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson for the first time got on to
Tom’s right eye, but not heavily; he then
popped his right on the ear, and also on the
ribs very heavily, staggering Tom, who
evidently winced under the latter visitation.
Tom, however shook himself together, and
some sharp exchanges took place, which
ended in Sayers dropping to avoid a fall.</p>

<p>     95.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson’s right neatly stopped. He
tried again with a rush, but Tom cleverly
ducked and got away. Poulson followed
him up, and napped a sharp reminder over
the right brow; Poulson returned on the
chest, and Tom got down.</p>

<p>     96.&mdash;&#8203;After some harmless exchanges,
Sayers got down, amidst the groans of the
Nottingham party.</p>

<p>     97.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson was again neatly stopped,
and Tom returned heavily on the mouth,
turning on the main once more. Poulson
made his right on the ribs, and then on the
left cheek, and, after one or two harmless
passes, Tom got down.</p>

<p>     98.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers put in his double on the
throat, and Poulson rushed to a close, and,
after a brief struggle, Sayers fell; Poulson
again, and in the most manly way, avoiding
failing on him.</p>

<p>     99.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, evidently the best man, dodged,
and put in his left on the side of Poulson’s
head; Harry wide of the mark with his return.
Tom came again, dodged him, and
whack went his left on the smelling-bottle.
Slight exchanges followed, and then Poulson,
as Sayers was retreating, caught him a
heavy right-hander on the jaw which knocked
him down.</p>

<p>     100.&mdash;&#8203;The Poulsonians anxious for the
call of “Time;” but to their surprise Tom
came up quite steady. He dodged his man,
popped in his double on the nose and left
peeper without a return, and then on the
throat, and in getting back fell.</p>

<p>     101.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson, nearly blind, dashed in
with determination, and heavy counter-hits
were exchanged, Tom getting well on the
mouth and Harry on the nose, and Sayers
slipped down. Three hours had now
elapsed.</p>

<p>     102.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers drew a fresh supply of the
ruby from Harry’s right cheek, and, in retreating,
fell. Another claim of foul.</p>

<p>     103.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson went in and made his right
on the side of Tom’s head. Tom retreated,
advanced, making his usual feint, but, on
seeing Poulson coming at him, he tried to
get back, and, his legs slipping apart, he
could not get himself into a defensive position,
and fell. Another claim of foul was
here made; but the referee, who had not
seen the round, owing to the interposition
of the bodies of the seconds and backers
of Poulson, pronounced “fair;” and in his
<a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a><span class="pageno">378</span>
decision we decidedly concur, as, in our
opinion, the fall on the part of Sayers was
entirely unpremeditated and accidental. It
was for some time before order was restored;
and the delay was of the greatest advantage
to Sayers, while it had an opposite effect
on Poulson, whose left eye was now all but
closed.</p>

<p>     104.&mdash;&#8203;Tom came up gaily, dodged his man,
who came towards him, and then nailed him
heavily on the proboscis and left peeper. A
close followed, and Sayers got down.</p>

<p>     105.&mdash;&#8203;Slight exchanges, in which no
damage was done, and Sayers slipped
down.</p>

<p>     106.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson dashed in to make a last
effort, and heavy counter-hits were exchanged.
Sayers caught him on the left
eye, and received a heavy rib-bender and
then a crack on the left ear, whereupon he
dropped.</p>

<p>     107.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers, bleeding from the left ear,
came up slowly and feinted in his usual style;
caught Harry on the right eye, and then on
the mark. Poulson popped his right
heavily on the ribs, and another give-and-take
rally followed, at the end of which
Sayers, who was still weak on his legs, got
down.</p>

<p>     108.&mdash;&#8203;Poulson’s face was now much swollen
and there was scarcely a glimmer from his
left peeper. He was, however, still strong
as ever on his pins. He rushed in, knowing
he had no time to spare, and caught Tom
heavily with his right on the left ear. Exchanges
followed, Sayers being straightest.
Poulson bored in, and got home heavily
with his right on the ribs, when Tom delivered
his left heavily on the jaw, and
knocked him down.</p>

<p>     109, and last.&mdash;&#8203;The last blow had evidently
been a settler for the gallant Poulson:
he came up slowly and all abroad.
The game fellow tried once more to effect a
lodgement, but missed, his head came forward
and Tom delivered the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grâce</span>
by a heavy right-hander on the jaw, which
again knocked the veteran off his legs, and,
on being taken up, he was found to be deaf
to the call of “Time.” He recovered in a
few minutes, and shed bitter tears of disappointment
at the unsatisfactory and unexpected
termination of his labours. Sayers
walked to a public house adjoining the
field of battle, and of course was vociferously
congratulated by his friends and admirers
upon his triumphant success. Poulson was
also conveyed to the public-house, and,
after taking some refreshment, became himself.
He was quite blind, and his mug
otherwise much battered, but beyond this
had sustained no serious injuries. Sayers
complained a good deal of the punishment
about his body, and the repeated visitations
to the side of his head, but of course the
fact of his being the winner went far to allay
the physical suffering he endured. Both
were enabled to return to town in the same
train with their friends, and arrived at their
respective houses about half-past nine
o’clock. The fight lasted three hours and
eight minutes.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Owing to the minute details
which we have given of all the material
incidents in this really extraordinary battle,
we may spare our readers the trouble of
reading many observations upon the respective
merits of the men, of which the account
of the different rounds will have enabled
them to form as correct an opinion as ourselves.
Tom Sayers, by his quickness on his
legs, his steadiness and excellent judgment,
not only astonished his adversary and his
backers, but completely took his own friends
by surprise. He had evidently much improved,
in every possible way, since his
defeat by Nat Langham. Great fault was
found with him for his too constant resort
to the dropping system; but for this he had
every excuse. He scarcely ever went down
without having had a bustling round, and
once only during the battle did we observe
anything at which an impartial man would
cavil. This was at a period in the middle
of the fight when he was extremely weak,
and at the time no appeal was made by the
friends of Poulson. It must be taken into
consideration that Tom was anything but
himself, and the ground was far from
favourable for keeping on his legs and getting
out of the reach of his weighty and
powerful adversary. It has been urged that
the ground was as much against Poulson as
Sayers; but this was hardly so. Poulson is
a steady ding-dong fighter, of the squarest
build, does not depend much on his defensive
tactics, and makes little use of his legs;
while Tom had to be continually jumping
back, and, when opposed to such superior
weight, would of course find proportionate
difficulty in keeping on his pins. Indeed,
many times when he fell he came to
the ground with such a “thud” as must
have shaken a good deal of his strength
out of him. We are aware that since the
match had been made many things had
occurred to harass Tom’s mind, and that
he had pecuniary difficulties to contend
with which, we trust, will not exist in
future matches; and this, again, must be
taken into consideration. He does not want
for friends, and, we doubt not, with steadiness
and good conduct, will find himself on
the high road to prosperity. Of Harry Poulson’s
gallantry and manliness we cannot say
too much. He fought from first to last in a
game, straightforward manner, with an
evident determination to do his best to win
in a fair and honourable way. He scorned
to take advantage of many opportunities of
falling on his man, when he might have
done so with perfect fairness, and otherwise
comported himself in a manner as reflects
the very highest credit upon his character
as a man, and a demonstrator of the noble
art of self-defence. Although evidently
annoyed at being unable to get home as he
<a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a><span class="pageno">379</span>
expected, he still never allowed his temper
to get the better of him; and often when
Tom, from his shifty tactics, evaded what
had been intended as a finisher, he stood
and shook his head at him, as much as to
say it was too bad, but not once did he
allow a harsh or angry expression to escape
him. He is truly one of the gamest of the
game; but he is too slow, and depends too
much on his right hand, to have much
chance of success against a really finished
boxer. We do not consider that his age had
anything to do with his defeat, for he is as
fresh as most London boxers who are ten
years his juniors. His bravery and universal
good conduct cannot but secure him
the respect and support of all admirers of
such good qualities.</p>

<p>The conquest of Poulson was unquestionably the greatest achievement
of Sayers’s pugilistic career. He was now established as a man with
whom the men under 12 stone on the boxing list must not meddle; at any
rate, none other were likely to get backers against him.</p>

<p>From this period the name of Tom Sayers mixes itself with every question
of the belt and the Championship.</p>

<p>In the year 1855, a proposition was set on foot by a number of patrons
of the Ring, to raise, by subscription, a sum of money to purchase a belt
of greater intrinsic value than anything of the kind previously presented,
in lieu of the belt which had “gone astray” during the squabbles between
Bendigo, Caunt, and the Tipton Slasher. Lists were opened, and before long
a sum of nearly £100 was collected. To Mr. Hancock, of New Bond Street,
was entrusted the manufacture of the trophy, and from that gentleman’s
establishment was produced the elegant badge of the highest fistic honours
which Tom Sayers so well and so worthily won. On the belt being ordered,
the committee who undertook its management issued the following as the
conditions on which it should be held: “That it should not be handed over
to any person claiming the Championship until he had proved his right to
it by a fight; that any pugilist having held it against all comers for three
years, without a defeat, should become its absolute possessor; that the
holder should be bound to meet every challenger of any weight who should
challenge him for the sum of £200 a side, within six months after the
issue of such challenge, within the three years; that he should not be
bound to fight for less than £200 a side; that at the final deposit for
every match within the three years the belt should be delivered up to the
committee until after the battle; and, finally, that on the belt being given
to the winner of any Champion-fight, he should deposit such security as
should be deemed necessary in the hands of the committee to ensure the
above regulations being carried out.”</p>

<p>No sooner did it become known that the belt was ready for whosoever
could win it, than there was a general stirring up of the dormant energies
of the big men who had retired, or thought to be about to retire, from the
<a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a><span class="pageno">380</span>
Ring. Harry Broome shook himself together; the Tipton Slasher roused
him from his lair; Tom Paddock’s hair stood on end between hope and
fear of disappointment; while Aaron Jones, who about this time (1855)
had fought the second of two tremendous battles with Paddock, and,
though defeated, had entirely removed any impressions as to his want of
pluck caused by his battles with Harry Orme, also pricked up his ears, and
issued a defiant grunt. The only man among the recent combatants
for Champion’s honours who made no sign was Harry Orme, who
was content to rest upon his well-earned reputation. At first it was
thought there would not be found a man sufficiently venturous to tackle
the “Ould Tipton,” but this was soon seen to be a fallacy; for not one
only, but each and every of the aspirants sent out a defiance to the crooked-legged
hero of the hardware districts. The first cartel that reached him
was that of Aaron Jones, and with him preliminaries were at once
arranged.</p>

<p>The challenges of Broome and Paddock arriving afterwards, the
Slasher informed them that they must wait the issue of the struggle with
Jones. Broome and Paddock seemed both disinclined to wait for this
event, and neither was desirous of postponing his claims to those of his co-challenger,
and, as a natural consequence, a good deal of badinage took
place between them, which ended in their being matched for £200 a side,
to ascertain which should have the preference. While they were in
training Aaron Jones was compelled to forfeit to the Tipton Slasher,
through meeting with an accident during his training; so that there
appeared a clear course for the winner.</p>

<p>The fight between Broome and Paddock took place on the 19th of
May, 1856, and was won by Tom Paddock with ease in 51 rounds, and
63 minutes, it being at once apparent that, though Harry Broome had
all the will and the courage to do deeds of valour, the power had deserted
him, and he had become prematurely old and stale. (See page 294.)</p>

<p>Soon after Paddock’s defeat of Broome, Paddock obtained the acme
of his desires&mdash;&#8203;<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, a match with his old opponent, the Slasher; but
when £80 a side had been staked Master Tom allowed his temper to get
the better of his judgment, and, having offended his best friends, had
to forfeit through a scarcity of “ochre.” This was not only a disappointment
to himself, but also to his opponent, who was thus foiled
in his efforts to get hold of the belt, which could not be obtained without
a mill, and which he had made sure of winning from Tom Paddock.
<a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a><span class="pageno">381</span>
Just previous to this mishap Jones had recovered from his accident, and,
to the surprise of all, had been matched with the “coming man,” Tom
Sayers; so that even here the “Old’un” was again done out of an
opponent, and the belt still remained in abeyance, to abide the issue
between Sayers and Jones, the winner to meet the ponderous Tipton
for the coveted trophy. This fight, which took place on the banks of
the Medway, on the 19th February, 1857, we now propose to narrate.</p>

<p>Owing to the puritanical persecution to which the Ring had been for
some time subjected, a line of country had to be selected which had for a
long time been untried, so that there was every prospect of matters being
adjusted in that quarter without let or hindrance. Although bills were
circulated, stating that a train would leave the Great Northern Station at
King’s Cross on Tuesday at nine o’clock, it was at the eleventh hour considered
that the locality would on the present occasion be too “warm,” and
therefore, an alteration was deemed prudent. This alteration could not be
made public at so late a period, and it was only those who happened to consult
the initiated at the benefit of the Pugilistic Benevolent Association, on
the previous Monday evening, who got a due to the real state of the case.
The consequence was that on Tuesday morning, at the Fenchurch Street
Station, there were at the utmost 180 persons, including a considerable
number of patricians and a very small proportion of the professors of the
noble art, while of the “roughs” and other noisy demonstrators there was
an almost total absence. These gentry and some few unfortunates of the
higher class hastened to the Great Northern terminus at the hour named
in the handbills, and great was their disappointment, and loud their indignation,
at finding themselves sold.</p>

<p>The start from Fenchurch Street took place at eight o’clock precisely,
and by nine o’clock Tilbury was reached, where all at once embarked in a
vessel provided for the purpose, and by twenty minutes to ten were safely
on board, and, greatly to the credit of the managers of the expedition, a
start was at once effected. In order to throw dust in the eyes of the Blues,
it was determined to proceed straight to the mouth of the river; and, in the
face of a stiff gale from E.N.E., the journey to the Nore was effected in
excellent style. The lumpy water in this locality had, as may be imagined,
a most unpleasant effect upon many of the voyagers, whose stomachs,
unaccustomed to salt water, and anything but improved in tone by their
nocturnal vigils (as they had sat up all night in order to be early in the
morning), were turned inside out; and the consequence was that swabs and
<a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a><span class="pageno">382</span>
buckets of water were in strong demand. After about an hour’s tossing
among the billows, “’bout ship” was the cry, the river was re-entered, and
the vessel sped homewards until a spot was reached not far from Canvey
Island, where Freeman and the Tipton Slasher fought. With some difficulty
a landing was effected, and Tom Oliver, Tom Callas, Puggy White,
<abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> proceeded to form the lists, although it was not without extraordinary
exertions that anything like a favourable spot could be found, and even
this was rough and extremely uneven, from the late heavy weather.
Numerous were the mishaps of the company on landing, but by no means
equal to those they experienced on attempting to regain the vessel after the
battle was over, when thick darkness overspread the land, and led many an
unwary traveller into mud and mire of the most consistent character. The
ring was pitched by half-past twelve o’clock, and a tolerable outer ring was
established; but, as usual when the attendance is small, the difficulty of
preserving this outer circle intact was very great, and towards the close of
the fight, notwithstanding the exertions of some of the ring-keepers, the
spectators crowded close to the ring, but, fortunately, did not disturb the
ropes and stakes.</p>

<p>The combatants, who had made a sort of demi-toilette on board the
steamer, quickly entered the ring, Sayers attended by Jemmy Welsh and
George Crockett, Jones advised by Alec Keene and Mike Madden. The
stake was £100 a side. The career of Tom’s youthful antagonist will be
found sketched at pages 253, 283, and 289 of this volume. Jones had the
advantage of Sayers in age by five years; his height 5 feet 11½ inches,
and his weight 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr></p>

<p>Jones, after his defeat by Orme, was on the shelf for a period of two years.
He then came out with a challenge to Tom Paddock, which was accepted,
and the men met July 18, 1854, at Long Reach, for £100 a side, and,
after as gallant a struggle as was ever witnessed, Jones became blind, and
his friends gave in for him, after fighting 121 rounds in two hours and
twenty-four minutes. So satisfied were his backers on this occasion that
they at once expressed their willingness to make a fresh match. After
some little time articles were entered into, and they went into training for
the second mill. This affair came off at Mildenhall on the 26th of June,
1855, and was another display of manly courage and perseverance on both
sides. Towards the close Jones, who for some time had the best of it, fell
off very weak, and Paddock, who, like his opponent, was much punished
and exhausted, saw that his time was come, and, shaking himself together,
<a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a><span class="pageno">383</span>
he rattled away in style until poor Aaron was once more compelled to cry
“a go,” after a contest of sixty-one rounds, in one hour and twenty-nine
minutes. Jones after this was matched with the Tipton Slasher, as we
have already stated, but this went off; and this brings us to the present
meeting.</p>

<p>On entering the ring both men were loudly cheered, and both looked
equally confident. No sooner had they put in an appearance than speculation
began. The Sayers party originally stood out for 6 to 4, but being
unable to get on at that price, they reduced their demands to 5 to 4, at
which price considerable business was done, and a bet of £10 to £8 was
made and staked between the men. It was piercingly cold; and, the ground
being in a moist state, all looked anxious for business, in the hope that the
excitement of the combat would dispel some of the shivering fits to which
the spectators, one and all, notwithstanding their Crimean-looking outfits,
seemed to be subject. Little time was lost by the men in denuding themselves
of their remaining outer-garments, and, the handkerchiefs having
been tied to the stakes (a light grey and white for Sayers, and a neat white
and blue check for Jones), at one o’clock precisely “Time” was called,
hands were clasped, and the men began</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On baring their forequarters
to the piercing breeze, a perceptible shiver
ran through the carcases of the combatants.
Sayers looked in perfect condition; every
muscle was perceptible, and we doubt
whether there was an ounce of superfluous
flesh about him. There was a smile of confidence
on his lips and bright sparkle in
his eye that betokened extraordinary
health and spirits. His attitude was artistic
and firm, yet light. Of course he stood
on the defensive, and eyed his heavier opponent.
There did not appear to be that
disparity of size that really existed; for
Jones stooped rather on throwing himself
on guard, and thus reduced his height
almost to a level with that of the gallant
Tom, who was upright as a dart. Aaron’s
condition did not seem to us so first-rate as
the first glance at him had led us to suppose.
His muscles, though large, were too well
covered, while his back and chest also displayed
much superfluous meat, and we
should say that his weight could not have
been less than 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> He, like Sayers,
looked confident, but was far more serious
in his demeanour. They both commenced
the round with the utmost caution, sparring,
and attempting to draw one another into
something like an opening; but for a long
time neither would throw a chance away.
At length Jones dashed out left and right;
but the blows passed over Tom’s shoulders,
and Tom with quickness tapped Aaron on
the face, but without force. Sayers now
let go his left, but Jones retreated. Tom
persevered, and was cleverly stopped. In
a third attempt, after more dodging, he got
heavily on Aaron’s mouth and stepped back
without a return. Jones now assumed the
offensive, but was stopped, and Tom, after
another dodge or two, planted his left
heavily on the mark, and then the same
hand on the side of Aaron’s nut, but not
heavily. Jones returned heavily on the
right peeper, and shortly after made a
second call at the same establishment.
More stopping and dodging, until Sayers
paid another visit to Aaron’s kisser, Jones
missing his return. Each now stopped a
lead; but immediately afterwards Jones
popped in his left on the snuff-box, a heavy
hit without a return. Tom grinned a
ghastly grin; but the crack evidently made
him see stars. Jones attempted to repeat
the dose; but Tom got well away, and, as
he retreated, popped his left on the neck.
More excellent stopping on both sides, and,
after a few harmless exchanges, Tom tried
a double with his left and got on the throat,
<a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"></a><span class="pageno">384</span>
but the blow lacked steam. Jones returned
with quickness over the left peeper, inflicting
a cut and drawing the claret. (“First
blood” for Jones.) Tom, although staggered,
was undaunted, and went at his man
with determination. He once more got on
the bread-basket heavily. Good counter-hits
followed, in which Jones again reached
Tom’s damaged peeper, drawing more of
the essential, and Tom delivered a straight
one on the snout, removing a small portion
of the bark. Tom then got on the left eye,
and, after some sharp punching at close
quarters, both fell. This round lasted exactly
half an hour.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Tom came up much flushed, and the
crimson distilling from his damaged eye.
After a little dodging, he tried his double,
but did not get it home. He tried a second
time, but was stopped, and Jones returned
on the left eye. This led to very heavy
counters, each on the larboard goggle.
Jones now feinted, and popped his left on
the nose. They got hold of one another,
swung round, broke away, and Sayers then
popped his left again on the left eye. Severe
exchanges followed at close quarters, and
both in the end were down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers quickly led off with his left,
and was stopped. He then tried his double,
but was short. In a third essay he got home
on Aaron’s nose, but not heavily. Twice
again did he pop in gentle taps, but he now
napped another rattler on the left eye.
Severe exchanges followed, Aaron again
turning on the stream from Tom’s left
brow, and Tom tapping his opponent’s
snuff-box. More exchanges in favour of
Jones; and in the end both fell in a scrambling
struggle, Jones under.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Tom’s left brow and the left side of
his canister were much swollen, but he was
still confident, and led off, Jones countering
him well on the mouth. Heavy exchanges
followed, Tom on the nose, and Jones on
the left cheek, and both again slipped down,
the ground being anything but level.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Tom let fly his left, but was neatly
stopped; Jones returned on the side of the
brain pan, and got down.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers came up, looking very serious,
and it subsequently turned out that he was
suffering from severe cramp in the stomach
and lower extremities. He went in, feinted,
and got well home on Jones’s left eye. This
led to sharp exchanges and a close, when
both were down, Jones being underneath.
Aaron had now a bump on his left peeper,
which was apparently closing.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron lost no time in sending out
his left, which fell on Tom’s chest. Heavy
counter-hits followed, Jones on the nose,
and Tom on the mouth. More exchanges
in favour of Sayers, who again got on
Aaron’s damaged optic, and the latter got
down.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers went to his man, and tried his
double, the second blow dropping on
Aaron’s sneezer, and Tom then got cleverly
away from the return. Exchanges ensued,
Tom on the mark, and Aaron on the mazzard;
Aaron then got home his right heavily
on the left side of Tom’s knowledge-box,
then his left on the left eye, and in the close
Sayers was down.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron led off, but was well stopped,
and this led to some sharp exchanges, Jones
on the bad peeper, and Tom on the left
brow. Sayers tried another double, and
once more visited Aaron’s nose, but not
heavily. More mutual stopping, and Jones,
at length, in getting away, slipped and
fell. One hour had now elapsed.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Tom planted his left on the beak,
and received a little one in return on the
forehead. Jones now let fly his left and
right, but was cleverly stopped. In a
second essay he got home on the left cheek.
Heavy exchanges followed, Tom getting on
both peepers, and Jones on the side of Tom’s
cranium with both daddles, and Tom fell.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron had now a mark on each
peeper, the left fast closing. Tom’s left,
too, appeared almost shut up. Jones tried
to take the lead, but missed; Sayers likewise
missed his return. Exchanges followed
in favour of Jones, who, in the end,
closed, and in the struggle both fell, Jones
uppermost.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;No time lost; both quickly at it,
and some sharp exchanges took place in
favour of Jones, who got heavily on Tom’s
nose. Tom made his left on the body
heavily, and they then pegged away wildly at
close quarters until Jones got down.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron dashed in and pegged away
left and right, but without precision, and
ultimately bored his man down.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Jones feinted and popped his left on
the left eye, without a return. Tom then
let go his left, but was short, and Jones,
in dashing at him in return, slipped and
fell.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron led off, left and right, but Tom
got away. He came again, and tried to
plant his left, but was short. He then tried
his double, but Jones got away. Both now
sparred and dodged, but nothing came of it.
At last Jones dashed in, and heavy exchanges
took place in favour of Jones, who,
however, in the end, fell.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Both at once went to work, and
heavy exchanges took place, each napping
it on the left ogle, and both fell through the
ropes.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Tom’s forehead and left eye much
disfigured. Jones let fly his left and right
on the sides of the nob very heavily, and
both again fell through the ropes.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Tom came up slowly, and was nailed
on the damaged peeper. In return he caught
Aaron on the brow, but not heavily. Jones
then made his left and right on the side of
the head and left eye, and Tom retaliated on
the nose a little one. A close followed, and
in the end both were down, Jones under.
</p>
<a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a><span class="pageno">385</span>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Tom dodged and got home on Aaron’s
smeller with his left, and Aaron then made
both hands on the left side of Tom’s wig-block.
A close and sharp struggle, when
both fell, Tom under.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Jones dashed in and let go both
hands on the head. Tom returned on the
left brow, and both fell backwards.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron again dashed in. He missed
his right, closed, and both fell, Jones under.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Tom now led off, but missed, and
Jones caught him heavily with his right on
the frontispiece, and knocked him down.
(“First knock-down for Jones.”)</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, on coming up, showed the
effect of the last blow on his forehead. He
attempted to lead off, but was very short.
He tried again with a like result; and
Jones, in letting go both hands in return,
overreached himself and fell.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron rattled in, planted his left and
right on the scent-box and left ear, the latter
very heavy, and bored Tom down.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Tom came up bleeding from a severe
cut on the left lug, and his gnomon much
out of straight. He tried to lead off, but
Jones caught him on the right brow, but
not very heavily. Tom then got home on
the body, and tremendous counter-hits followed,
in favour of Jones, who, in the end,
slipped and fell, Tom catching him, just as
he reached the ground, on the side of the
head.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Jones went in left and right, closed,
and both were down. Sayers was now very
weak, and the Jonesites were in ecstasies.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron led off, getting well on the
side of Tom’s nut with his right. Tom
missed his return, and Jones then planted his
left and right on the top of the skull;
closed at the ropes, where Tom managed to
throw him but not heavily.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Jones led off, and got well on Tom’s
nose with his left, and Tom returned on
the side of the head. After a little dodging,
Jones popped his left on Tom’s left
peeper, and his right on the jaw, again
flooring Tom and falling on him.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, who was excessively weak,
came up slow, but determined; he tried his
left at the body, but was short. Jones then
let fly his left in return, but was countered
on the mouth. He then planted his left
and right on Tom’s damaged listener, and
in the end fell.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron, after a few dodges, once more
popped a little ’un on Tom’s ear. Tom
thereupon dashed in, but got a little one on
the nose, and another on the side of the
head, and Jones, in getting away, fell,
laughing.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Jones attempted to lead off, but
Tom got away. Jones followed him up,
caught him again on the side of the nob,
closed, and both rolled over together.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;Jones dashed in, planted both hands
on the brain-pan, closed, and forced Tom
down.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;Jones again rushed in, but inflicted
no damage, and again bored Tom down.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Jones still forced the fighting, and
caught Tom, who seemed very tired, on the
side of the head, and, in the end, both
slipped down.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers was forced down, after getting
a gentle reminder on the side of his
damaged figure-head.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, a little refreshed, sparred
about for wind, until Jones went in, and
heavy exchanges took place, in favour of
Jones, when both fell backwards.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, recovering a little, tried his
double, but Jones got away, and, as Tom
came, he nailed him on the left brow. Tom
then made his left on the mark, but again
napped it heavily on the left eye. Aaron
now got on the nose with his left&mdash;&#8203;a heavy
spank&mdash;&#8203;and, in getting back, he staggered
and fell.</p>

<p>     38.&mdash;&#8203;Jones dodged, and planted his left
on the mouth heavily, and his right on the
side of the head. Tom returned slightly on
the nose, and, after slight exchanges, both
fell.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;Very slight exchanges, and Sayers
slipped down.</p>

<p>     40.&mdash;&#8203;After a little sparring they got close,
and exchanges took place, each getting it on
the mouth. Sayers then tried his left at
the mark, but Jones got away. Tom followed
him up, and was caught by Aaron,
left and right, on the side of his head and
fell.</p>

<p>     41.&mdash;&#8203;Tom came up, shook himself, and
rattled in, but he got it on the top of his
cranium. Jones, in stepping back, fell.
Two hours had now expired.</p>

<p>     42.&mdash;&#8203;Jones, steady, let go his left on the
side of Tom’s head, and then both mauleys
on the same spot. Tom followed him up,
but got it again on the brow. He, however,
got home on Jones’s body, and, in retreating
slipped and fell.</p>

<p>     43.&mdash;&#8203;Long sparring for wind, until Jones
once more made play on the left side of
Tom’s occiput, and then on his snout. Tom
returned on the latter organ, but not heavily.
He now tried his favourite double, but did
not get home. In a second attempt he got
heavily on Aaron’s proboscis, and got away.
Exchanges followed, in which Tom again
delivered heavily on the nose with his left,
and in the end Jones dropped.</p>

<p>     44.&mdash;&#8203;Tom was now evidently recovering
from his exhaustion. He came up steadier,
and sparred shiftily until Jones commenced
the attack, when he stopped him neatly.
Heavy counter-hits followed on the jaw,
after which Sayers tried the double once
again, but was stopped. More good counter-hits,
Tom getting well on Aaron’s left eye,
and receiving on the mouth. Aaron’s left
eye all but closed.</p>

<p>     45.&mdash;&#8203;More sparring, until Jones let fly his
left, but Sayers got away. Exchanges followed,
Tom on the whistler, and Jones on
<a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a><span class="pageno">386</span>
the nose, but not heavily. More sharp
counter-hitting, Tom once more getting on
the left eye severely. Jones returned, but
not effectively, with both hands on the side
of the head, and in getting away from the
return he fell.</p>

<p>     46.&mdash;&#8203;Jones succeeded in planting a spanking
hit from the left on the left eye, and
then another with the same hand on the
left cheek. In a third attempt he was
stopped. Heavy counter-hits followed, and
in the end Jones fell, Sayers falling over
him.</p>

<p>     47.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron feinted with his left, and got
well on Tom’s nose; a very straight hit.
Tom, in return, tried his double, but was
short. After some more ineffectual attempts
they got to it, and tremendous exchanges
took place, each getting it on the nose and
left eye, and in the end Jones got down.
Two hours, fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>     48.&mdash;&#8203;Tom tried to lead off, but was stopped,
and Jones planted his left on the cheek.
Tom now stopped two of Jones’s hits, after
which heavy exchanges took place, Tom
getting well on to the left eye, and Jones on
the nose. More sharp exchanges, left and
right, each getting pepper in earnest, and
the favours mutually divided. A break
away, and to it again, ding-dong, and Tom
drew the crimson from Aaron’s left peeper,
which was now effectually closed. In the
end Jones fell. It was now anybody’s
battle; Tom had quite recovered his wind,
and was nearly as strong as his heavier
opponent.</p>

<p>     49.&mdash;&#8203;Both much punished. Sayers sparred
until Jones tried to lead off, when he got
away. Jones followed him up, but was short
in his deliveries. In the end they closed,
and as they were falling Tom popped his
right sharply on Aaron’s back.</p>

<p>     50.&mdash;&#8203;Jones, after sparring, led off, and
got home on the nose, but not heavily; Tom
returned on the right peeper, and some
pretty exchanges, left and right, took place,
followed by a break away, and Jones then
stopped Tom’s left; Tom, in return, stopped
Aaron, and planted his left on the mark,
and then on the left eye, and Jones got
down.</p>

<p>     51.&mdash;&#8203;Jones led off, but was stopped. He
persevered, and a good give-and-take rally
followed, Jones getting on the left eye, and
Tom on the left cheek heavily. Tom next
got on the mouth, drawing the Burgundy,
and then on the nose and left cheek. Another
sharp rally followed, after a break away, and
in the end both down.</p>

<p>     52.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers visibly improving while Jones
fell off. Jones was short in his lead, and
Tom returned on the smelling-bottle, and
got away. Jones followed and dashed out
his left, but Tom ducked his head. Tom
then got home on the mouth and nose, and
drew more of the ruby from the latter ornament.
Jones succeeded in returning a little
’un on the left eye, and Sayers slipped
down.</p>

<p>     53.&mdash;&#8203;Jones, who was bleeding from the
left eye and month, led off, but was well
stopped. He then missed his left, but in
the end heavy exchanges, left and right,
took place, Jones on the side of the nut and
the neck, and in getting back he fell.</p>

<p>     54.&mdash;&#8203;Tom now essayed a lead, but was
stopped. A second attempt reached Aaron’s
body, but not heavily, and Jones returned
on the nose. Tom tried his double, but
missed, and Jones popped a little one on the
mouth, and then his left on the left eye, and
fell in the corner.</p>

<p>     55.&mdash;&#8203;Tom dodged about until he got within
distance, and then got home heavily on the
mark. Jones returned on the jaw with his
right, but not heavily. After some more
sparring, Jones dashed in, when Tom met
him very sharply on the right cheek-bone
with his left, and Aaron fell all of a heap.
He was carried to his corner, where it was
with the utmost difficulty he could be got
round at the call of “Time.”</p>

<p>     56.&mdash;&#8203;Jones came up all abroad, and Tom
popped in another spank on the same spot,
whereupon Jones again fell. It was thought
to be all over; but, by dint of shaking him
up, Aaron was again enabled to respond to
the call.</p>

<p>     57.&mdash;&#8203;Tom rushed at his man to administer
the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span>, but, going in without
precision, he contrived to run against Aaron’s
left, which was swung wildly out, the
blow, which alighted on Tom’s nose, regularly
staggered him. He quickly recovered
himself, and went in again, but Jones fell
weak.</p>

<p>     After this, the battle continued to the
62nd round, Jones getting gradually blind,
and Sayers becoming very tired. At length
in the 62nd round, after slight exchanges, the
men, who were much exhausted, stood still,
looking at each other for some time, their
seconds covering them with rugs. Upon this
the referee and umpires called on them to
go in and finish. Both went to the scratch,
but on Sayers approaching Jones, the latter
retreated to his corner, and Tom, in obedience
to the orders of his seconds, declined
going to fight him there. It was getting
dark, and it was clear that Jones and his
friends were determined not to throw a
chance away. The referee once more called
on Jones to go to the scratch, which he did,
but with precisely the same result; and the
referee, seeing that Tom was not strong
enough to go with prudence to finish on his
adversary’s ground, and that Jones was unwilling
to try the question at the scratch
in his then exhausted state, ordered the
men to shake hands, leaving the motion as
to further hostilities to a future day. Both
were severely punished; each had a peeper
closed; Jones’s right was fast following his
left, and his right hand was injured; so that
a second meeting the same week was not to
be thought of. The fight lasted exactly
three hours. The men and their friends
<a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a><span class="pageno">387</span>
now hastened to regain the vessel, and it
was dark long ere the last of the company
were safely on board. Of course there
were many laughable accidents in the
mud through which all had to wade; but
luckily, nothing occurred of a serious nature
to mar the pleasures of the day, which,
although in some measure clouded by the
fact that the battle was not finished, still
left sufficient impression on the minds of the
spectators to cause them to remember this
brilliant passage of arms, which formed so
hopeful an opening to the pugilistic year 1857.
The vessel conveyed the company with all
due speed to a convenient place for debarkation,
whence they obtained a passage by
railway to the Metropolis, which was reached
in safety by nine o’clock. Numerous complaints
were made by the disappointed ones
who went to the Great Northern Railway, at
the manner in which they were deceived;
and the only consolation is that we are sorry
for those whom we should have been glad
to welcome at the ring-side, but who have
themselves alone to blame for not finding
out the final fixture as many others had
done; while as to others of a certain class,
who are always more free than welcome, we
can with truth say their room was better
than their company, and we rejoice, with
others who were present, that they were so
completely sold. Some unlucky wights got
a sort of hint as to the fixture, and arrived
within a few miles of the spot at a late hour
in the afternoon, and were landed, but unluckily
for them, on the wrong island, and
here the poor fellows had to remain all night,
and sleep under a haystack. The boats that
landed them had departed, and they could
make no one hear; so that, cold, hungry,
and thirsty, they had to weather the cold,
severe night in the best way they could.</p>

<p>The renewed battle, which was for £200 and an additional bet of £100,
was fixed for Tuesday, the 10th February, 1857, on the same spot as the
previous gallant encounter. On this occasion Sayers was seconded by
Jemmy Massey and Bill Hayes, with Jemmy Welsh as bottle-holder;
Aaron Jones by Alec Keene and Jack Hicks, Jack Macdonald taking care
of the restoratives. 7 to 4 on Sayers.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On toeing the scratch the condition
of both men struck the spectators
with admiration. In our opinion it was perfect
on both sides, but the development of
muscle was decidedly in favour of Sayers,
who is better ribbed up, and has his thews
and sinews laid on in the right place. He
looked brown, wiry, and healthy, and, for a
middle weight, seemed wonderfully big.
Jones, who is of fairer complexion, was
altogether more delicate in appearance than
Sayers, and, although so much taller,
heavier, and longer, did not loom out so
much larger as might be expected. He is a
fine-made, muscular young fellow, but still
there is an appearance about him which at
once leads to the conclusion that his stamina
is scarcely fitted for the wear and tear of
gladiatorial encounters. He is about twenty-six
years of age, and in height is over 5 feet
11 inches, while Tom Sayers is thirty-one,
and is little more than 5 feet 8 inches. It
was soon seen that Sayers intended to pursue
different tactics to those he adopted on
the previous occasion. He dodged about
for a few seconds, and then let go his left
and right with great quickness, but Jones
stopped him neatly, and in getting back
fell.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Tom came up smiling, feinted with
his left, and then tried his favourite double;
the first hit was stopped, but the second
caught Aaron on the chin. This he repeated,
and got away without a return. After trying
his double once more without success, he
planted his left very heavily on the mark.
Jones at once went to close quarters, and
some quick in-fighting took place in favour
of Sayers, who got well on to Aaron’s snuffbox
with his left, drawing “first blood.”
Jones got on the left side of Tom’s head,
but not heavily, and at length both fell.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Both quick to the call of “Time,”
and Sayers at once went to work with his
left, Jones countering him heavily, each
getting it on the forehead. Tom then
popped his left on the mark, and Aaron returned,
but not heavily, on the nose. Tom
now again planted the left on the mark, and
was stopped in a second effort. Heavy exchanges
next took place, Tom once more
drawing the cork from a cut on Aaron’s
sniffer, and receiving on the left ear. After
a few dodges, Tom again approached, and
made a heavy call on Aaron’s bread-basket,
then planted a stinger between the eyes,
and got away laughing. He attempted
to repeat the dose, but was stopped.
Another effort was more successful, and he
dropped on the mark, staggering Jones, who,
however, recovered himself, and popped
his left on the chest, then on the left
<a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a><span class="pageno">388</span>
cheek, but not heavily. Sparring until
Tom got within distance and shot out his
left heavily on the proboscis, without a
return, Jones being a little wild. Tom now
essayed his double, but Jones got away,
and returned on the mouth. Tom persevered,
and napped a little ’un on the left
eye for his pains; still, he would be at work,
and got well on Aaron’s left peeper, drawing
the ruby. Heavy exchanges followed,
Jones getting on Tom’s left brow, and
Tom turning on the home-brewed from
Aaron’s nasal organ. After two or three
slight exchanges in favour of Sayers, he
again put the double on, reaching the left
cheek and bread-basket. Next he popped
another hot one on the victualling department,
receiving a slight return on the forehead.
After a break away he stole in, and
bang went his left on Aaron’s damaged eye,
drawing more of the ruby. A merry little
rally followed in favour of Sayers, who at
last broke away, and sparred as if blown
from his fast fighting. Jones approached
to take advantage of this, when Tom propped
him on the brow, and then on the forehead.
Jones returned with both hands, but not
heavily, on the brow and body, and another
bustling rally came off, Tom getting home
on the left ogle and throat heavily, and
Aaron on the larboard cheek. Another
break away, and Tom, on getting himself
together, resumed the double, got on the
mark very heavily, and then popped his
right on the left side of Aaron’s nob; he
got away laughing, and as Jones tried to
follow him up he warned him off by a pop
on the left eye. A heavy rally at last took
place, in which Jones got sharply on the
left ear, and Sayers on the left eye, and this
protracted and well-fought round was concluded
by Tom slipping down.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers, on coming up, showed a mark
on his forehead, and another on his left ear,
while Aaron’s left eye and nose were much
out of the perpendicular. Tom lost no time
in going to work, and planted his one, two,
the left on Aaron’s right eye, and the right
on the left jaw, knocking Aaron off his
pins. (“First knock-down” for Sayers.)
Jones seemed all abroad, and it was with the
greatest difficulty that he was got round to
the call of “Time.”</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers at once went in left and right,
but he was too anxious to finish his handiwork,
and the blows lacked precision. He
reached the side of Aaron’s nob, and Jones
returned slightly on the same spot, and after
mild exchanges, both fell. This gave Jones
time to get round, and by the commencement
of the next round he had shaken off
the nasty one he had got in the fourth.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Tom tried his double, but missed, and
Jones rushed in to close, when Tom caught
him round the neck and punched him heavily
on the left peeper and nozzle, drawing more
of the ruby, In the end both fell, Sayers
under.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron came up with his left eye all
but closed. Tom let go his left, but Jones
returned on the nose. Tom tried again and
got on the ribs; Jones returned merrily left
and right, but did little damage, and Tom
fell in his corner.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Jones dashed in and pegged away with
both mauleys on the left side or Tom’s knowledge-box;
Tom returned on the left brow
and closed, when both fell, Tom under.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Jones again dashed in, and some sharp
in-fighting took place, followed by a close,
in which both fell, Jones, this time, being
underneath.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Tom’s dial seemed flushed, but his
eyes were still uninjured. Jones rattled in
to close, some quick fibbing took place, followed
by a long struggle for the fall, which
Sayers got and fell on his man. In drawing
his legs away, he brought one foot in smart
contact with Aaron’s leg, which was claimed
as a foul kick, but disallowed by the referee,
being evidently accidental.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Jones again took the initiative, and
let go both hands on Tom’s forehead, and
then his left on the nose. Tom returned on
the left eye, and then a squasher on the
mark. Exchanges, and Sayers fell, evidently
fatigued by his fast fighting.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Jones persevered in his forcing system,
and got on the left side of Tom’s cranium,
Tom returning very heavily on the
nose. Jones again went in, and planted his
left under the left optic, closed, and both
fell, Tom under.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Jones rushed at Tom, and pegged
away at him in his corner. It was a rambling,
scrambling round, and both fell, no
mischief being done.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Jones again led off, but Tom propped
him well on the left eye, and Aaron fell on
his face.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Good exchanges on the left cheek,
after which Jones got well on Tom’s throat,
closed, and both were down.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Jones dashed at Tom, popped in his
left and right on the frontispiece and nose,
and bored Tom through the ropes.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Jones again opened the ball, got on
to Tom’s left ear, closed, and both were
down.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron led off on Tom’s nose; Tom
returned on the left eye, very heavily, and
Aaron fell.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Tom resumed the initiative, and
reached Aaron’s nose&mdash;&#8203;by his favourite
double. Jones returned, but not heavily,
on the forehead; after which Tom cross-countered
him prettily on the left peeper,
and this led to exchanges in favour of Jones,
when Sayers fell.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Both quick to work; good exchanges,
and in the end Jones floored Tom by a heavy
right-hander on the jaw. (Loud cheers for
Jones.)</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Jones, elated, rushed in, but Tom
steadied him by a straight ’un on the left
cheek, and Jones dropped.
</p>
<a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a><span class="pageno">389</span>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron missed both hands, and after
some sparring Tom caught him heavily on
the left ogle, and Jones dropped. Sayers also
fell.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, who seemed getting fresh wind,
rattled in, and planted his double on the
nose and mouth. Jones rushed at him, and
in the scramble Sayers was bored over.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Tom popped a left-hander on the
“grubbery,” received a little one on the nose,
and fell.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Heavy exchanges, Sayers on the left
eye, and Aaron on the nose. Jones slipped
down.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Jones led off with both hands, but
not heavily, and Tom returned severely on
the nose and left eye, which was now quite
closed. Jones fell.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Jones rushed to close quarters, and
after a brief struggle fell.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Tom feinted, and popped his left
twice on Aaron’s damaged peeper. Jones
returned on the mouth, and Tom fell.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;Jones went to work, catching Tom
over the right eye, and Sayers in getting
back fell.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;Both went to work with good will,
and, after sharp exchanges in favour of
Sayers, Jones got down.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron tried to lead off, but was well
stopped, and Tom returned on the mark.
He next popped his left on the left cheek,
and in getting away slipped down, just
escaping a heavy upper-cut.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;Tom feinted, and then got well on to
Aaron’s nose with his left, and retreated,
Aaron pursuing him. At length they got
close, and Tom sent in a stiffener on the
scent-box, receiving a right-hander on the
left ear, which opened a cut received in their
former fight, and both fell.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;Tom again seemed tired, and sparred
for wind. Jones came to him, when Tom let
go his left on the jaw, closed, and both fell.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Tom slowest to time. He tried his
left, but was stopped; Aaron closed, and
Tom fibbed him on the left eye as they fell.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;After a little dodging, they got close,
and heavy counters were exchanged. They
now closed, and, as they fell, Tom again put
a little one on Aaron’s left eye.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;A close and a struggle, when both
fell, Jones under.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers led off, but was stopped, and,
after a wild scramble, Tom fell. One hour
and five minutes had now elapsed.</p>

<p>     38.&mdash;&#8203;Jones dashed in, but Tom steadied
him by a left-hander on the left cheek, and
Aaron got down.</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;Jones, still first, let go left and right
on the mouth and left cheek. Sayers returned
on the blind eye, and got down.</p>

<p>     40.&mdash;&#8203;Jones let fly his left, but missed.
Slight exchanges to a close, and both down.</p>

<p>     41.&mdash;&#8203;Jones, on the forcing system, planted
his left on the jaw and then on the left ear,
and as he was pursuing his man he fell on
his face.</p>

<p>     42.&mdash;&#8203;Jones missed his left. Tom returned
open-handed on the back, and Jones dropped.</p>

<p>     43.&mdash;&#8203;Jones dashed to a close at the ropes,
where they pegged away smartly but ineffectually
until they fell.</p>

<p>     44.&mdash;&#8203;Tom got home on the left jaw. Aaron
missed both hands, and fell.</p>

<p>     45.&mdash;&#8203;Jones went to work, but without
precision, and as Sayers retreated, Jones fell
on his face. It was clear that Tom was
carefully nursing himself, while Jones, feeling
that both his ogles were going, was
forcing the fighting, in order to tire out his
opponent before he became blind.</p>

<p>     46.&mdash;&#8203;Jones rattled in and caught Tom on
the left cheek, but not heavily. Tom returned
on the left peeper, drawing more
claret, and Jones dropped.</p>

<p>     47.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron, in his anxiety, missed both
mauleys, and Tom caught him a heavy right-hander
on the proboscis, whereupon Jones
dropped.</p>

<p>     48.&mdash;&#8203;Jones went to his man, who nailed
him on the left ogle, and, as Jones persevered,
he caught him heavily on the throat, and
Jones fell.</p>

<p>     49.&mdash;&#8203;Tom tried to lead off, but was short,
and Jones returned heavily on the ribs with
his right. He then attempted to close, but,
on Sayers catching hold of him, he fell.</p>

<p>     50.&mdash;&#8203;Tom tried his double, but Jones
stopped him, and in getting away slipped
down.</p>

<p>     51.&mdash;&#8203;Slight exchanges; Jones on the
mouth and Sayers on the nose, and Jones
down.</p>

<p>     52.&mdash;&#8203;Jones led off and was neatly stopped.
Tom missed his return, and Jones fell forward.</p>

<p>     53.&mdash;&#8203;Tom led off and got on Aaron’s blind
eye. Jones returned very slightly on the
nose, and fell.</p>

<p>     54.&mdash;&#8203;Tom planted his left heavily on the
mark, which led to mutual exchanges, and
Jones fell.</p>

<p>     55.&mdash;&#8203;Tom feinted and popped both hands
slightly on Aaron’s good eye, which began to
tell tales. Jones returned on the left ear,
but it was too long a shot to do damage, and
Sayers fell.</p>

<p>     56.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron opened the ball, and planted
his left and right on the nose and ear twice
in succession. He then rushed in, when Tom
stopped him by a straight one on the blind
eye, and Jones down.</p>

<p>     57.&mdash;&#8203;Jones again went to work, but Tom
was too quick on his pins, and got out of
harm’s way. Sayers missed his return, and
Jones fell.</p>

<p>     58.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, still on the nursing system,
kept himself quiet, waiting for the attack.
Jones went in, but Tom stepped back; slight
exchanges ensued, and Jones down.</p>

<p>     59.&mdash;&#8203;Jones let go his left; Tom ducked
his nut, and the blow went over, when Jones
fell. A claim of foul, as Jones fell without
a blow. The referee said, “Fight on.”</p>

<p>     60.&mdash;&#8203;Jones popped his left on the chest;
<a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a><span class="pageno">390</span>
Tom returned on the left cheek, and Jones
fell. One hour and a half had now elapsed.</p>

<p>     61.&mdash;&#8203;Jones, still first to begin, got on Tom’s
nose and fell, Tom falling over him.</p>

<p>     62.&mdash;&#8203;Jones planted his left very slightly
on the ride of Tom’s nob; Tom just touched
him on the smeller in return, and Jones
down again.</p>

<p>     63.&mdash;&#8203;Jones rushed in, caught Tom on the
chin, and Tom fell. The blow was not very
heavy.</p>

<p>     64.&mdash;&#8203;Jones missed both hands, got a little
one on the side of his nut, and fell.</p>

<p>     65.&mdash;&#8203;Jones got home, left and right, heavily
on the ribs; Tom retaliated on the mark,
and Jones down.</p>

<p>     66.&mdash;&#8203;Jones let go his left, but Tom avoided
the force of the blow by stepping back. He
returned on the neck, and Jones got down.</p>

<p>     67&ndash;71.&mdash;&#8203;In all these rounds Jones led off,
but did no mischief, from Tom’s quickness
on his pins, and in each Jones was down.</p>

<p>     72.&mdash;&#8203;Tom still waiting and resting himself;
Jones came in and planted his right on the
ribs. Tom returned on the right ogle, but
not heavily, and Jones down, his right eye
going fast. Sayers, though much tired, had
both eyes well open, and his face presented
no very serious marks of punishment.</p>

<p>     73.&mdash;&#8203;Heavy exchanges, and Jones fell on
his face.</p>

<p>     74.&mdash;&#8203;Jones tried to lead off, but was
stopped. Counter-hits, Sayers on the nose,
and Jones on the cheek, and Jones fell.</p>

<p>     75.&mdash;&#8203;Heavy exchanges, in favour of Sayers,
and Jones down.</p>

<p>     76.&mdash;&#8203;Jones, who saw he must do it quickly
or not at all, dashed in recklessly, but was
stopped. Tom popped a little one on the
nose, and Jones down.</p>

<p>     77.&mdash;&#8203;Jones was again stopped, and Tom
got well on his good eye, and Jones fell.</p>

<p>     78.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers stopped Aaron’s rush, and
again got on to his good peeper. Jones
instantly fell on his knees.</p>

<p>     79.&mdash;&#8203;Aaron delivered his left on the nose,
and, in trying to repeat it fell on his face.
Another claim that he had fallen without a
blow not allowed.</p>

<p>     80.&mdash;&#8203;Heavy exchanges, Tom getting
again on Aaron’s good peeper, which was
now all but shut up, and Jones down.</p>

<p>     81.&mdash;&#8203;Jones led off, but wofully out of
distance, and fell forward.</p>

<p>     82.&mdash;&#8203;Exchanges in favour of Sayers, and
Jones down weak.</p>

<p>     83.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, who saw his time had arrived,
went in, planted his favourite double on
Aaron’s good peeper, and Jones fell.</p>

<p>     84.&mdash;&#8203;After a little fiddling, Tom crept
close again, dashed out his left on the good
eye, and then on the cheek, and Jones
down.</p>

<p>     85 and last.&mdash;&#8203;Jones made a last effort,
was easily stopped, and, as he turned
round Tom caught him with his right a
terrific half-arm hit on the right eye, and
knocked him off his pins. It was evidently
a finisher. Poor Aaron’s nob fell forward,
and it was at once apparent that his remaining
daylight was closed; and his seconds,
seeing this, of course threw up the sponge,
Tom being proclaimed the winner, after a
gallant battle of exactly <em>two hours</em>. Sayers
at once went to shake hands with his brave
antagonist, and then repaired on board the
vessel, whither he was soon followed by
Jones, whose damaged peeper was at once
looked to by a medical friend. The poor
fellow was very severely punished, but he
did not seem to feel this so acutely as he
did the bitter disappointment of having to
play second fiddle to one so much smaller
than himself. The expedition quickly got
under way, and all reached the Metropolis
by nine o’clock. As soon as Sayers was
dressed he went round among his fellow-passengers,
and made a collection for his
fallen antagonist, which reached the sum of
£8. Beyond fatigue, and a few trifling
bruises on his forehead and nose, he was
unscathed, and he certainly could scarcely
be said to have a black eye.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;We have little doubt that
many of our readers will have anticipated
the remarks that we feel called upon to
make respecting the two game encounters
between these men. On the first occasion
it was obvious that Sayers felt he had a
great undertaking before him, and he was
therefore naturally cautious in the outset
not to throw a chance away which might at
once put the victory beyond his reach.
Jones was known to be a very heavy hitter
with his right, as was proved by the severe
punishment he dealt out to Tom Paddock in
both their mills. Sayers accordingly “played
’possum,” and in the first few rounds allowed
him to take the initiative, in order
that he might measure his powers carefully
before he exposed himself to danger. Tom
proved himself extremely quick on his
pins, and by his agility he to a certain extent
neutralised the effect of Jones’s severe
lunges. True, he got hit occasionally with
effect, as witness the cut over his left eye,
and also on his left ear. Jones, to his surprise,
found before him a man clearly his
superior at out-fighting, and one, too, as he
soon discovered, but little his inferior in
bodily strength. For the first hour and a
half, it will be recollected, he had apparently
the advantage, Sayers suffering severely
from cramp, and having to depend principally
upon his legs to keep him out of
harm’s way; but after this he gradually
recovered, and Jones, as was the case in
his fights with Paddock, after the said hour
and a half, gradually fell off, and became
languid in his exertions. Tom, of course,
improved the occasion, and showed such
superiority in hitting that many thought
he would have won with the greatest certainty
had not darkness come on. We must
confess that, although we did not say so at
the time, we entertained a similar opinion,
and we at the same time thought that the
<a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a><span class="pageno">391</span>
darkness was in other respects an unfortunate
circumstance for Sayers, believing,
as we did, that Jones, profiting by experience,
would at the next meeting have resorted to
a different system of milling, and, by at
once going to close quarters, have reduced
his adversary to such a state in a few
rounds as to render victory certain. It
seemed to us that this would have been his
game in the first fight, instead of trusting to
long shots, at which he found Sayers as good
as himself, and we, in common with others,
were fully prepared to see him adopt the
system. There is no harm now in making
known our opinion that Aaron’s performance
on the first occasion disappointed us
not a little. We all along thought Sayers
had overmatched himself, and it was not
until the conclusion of the first round that
we changed our mind. Many shared our belief
that the man who could maul the game
and resolute Paddock as Jones had done
must prove too much for an antagonist so
inferior in size and weight as Sayers, and
many blamed the latter for his presumption.
Among this latter class we do not number
ourselves, for it is our practice never to
blame a man for soaring at high game when
he really feels confidence in his own powers.
Ambition, when kept within bounds, is a
praiseworthy quality, and Sayers merely
followed the example of other middle
weights who had preceded him, in essaying
to raise himself to a higher level when he
could not find an antagonist worthy of his
fist in his own sphere. How fully he was
justified in his confident aspirations the result
has proved. On Tuesday last, as may
be gathered from our account of the fight,
Jones fought even less “judgmatically”
than at the first merry meeting. Instead
of forcing the fighting at once,
as he had expressed his intention of
doing, he allowed Sayers to open the ball,
and in the very onset to inflict such punishment
upon him as to shake the confidence of
his friends very materially; and not only
did he allow his adversary to take extraordinary
liberties with him, but he seemed
to have lost his precision in returning, and
for some time made not the slightest impression
upon Tom’s wig-block. The exceedingly
clever performance of Sayers in the
third round, and the apparent impunity
with which he got home upon all parts of
Aaron’s dial, took his own friends by surprise,
and the fear expressed was that he
was fighting too fast for a long day, and that
the strength and length of his opponent
must tell with fearful effect when he became
tired. He was cautioned as to this, but
requested to be allowed to fight his own way,
as he knew what suited him best. The blow
on Aaron’s jaw in the fourth round was very
severe, and nearly decided the event, and
this we are induced to believe had
some effect in stopping his rushes later
in the fight, when, had he been capable
of continuing the offensive with
effect, the result might have been very
serious to Tom, who for a long period was
exceedingly fatigued, and had to nurse himself
in the most careful manner in order to
bring himself through. The improvement he
(Sayers) displayed in every way, since his
last match, was extraordinary. His system
of leading off is almost perfect, and his
quickness on his legs would have delighted
the late Mr. John Jackson, whose opinion on
the subject of this qualification is well known.
He had little recourse to stopping, trusting
to his activity to keep him out of harm’s
way, and the success with which his manœuvring
was attended was proved by the fact
that he had scarcely a black eye, and, beyond
exhaustion, had nothing to complain of. In
addition to his quickness in defence, he seems
also to have acquired greater facility in pursuing
the offensive, and the weight with
which many of his blows fell upon his opponent
proved that his hitting was as effective
as that of most 12 stone men. As usual, he
stood up in the gamest, most resolute manner,
and faced his adversary throughout with
the utmost good humour, but, at the same
time, with determination. By many it was
expected he would have adopted the dropping
system, as he had done with Poulson;
but we were delighted to perceive that on
neither occasion did such a notion enter his
head; and indeed we are told that even with
the bold Nottingham man he would not have
had recourse to it, had he not been terribly
out of condition, and altogether in such a
state as to be incapable otherwise of resisting
the onslaughts of so powerful an opponent.
We understand that Tom has now an
intention of looking still higher in the scale
for an opponent worthy of his powers, and
both Tom Paddock and the Tipton Slasher
are talked of as his next antagonists, but that
he will first rest on his oars a while to recover
from his recent fatigue. How far this may
be true we know not, but we presume time
will show. Of this, however, we are confident,
that whoever the Middle Weight
Champion may next pick out, that worthy
must look to his laurels, and leave no stone
unturned to get himself fit for the fray; for
big as he may be, he will have a hard day’s
work before him. Of Aaron Jones we must
say that his exhibition on each day disappointed
us, and fell far short of what we
expected after his extraordinary encounters
with Paddock. True it is that he never once
flinched from punishment, and when severely
hit persevered in the most manly way to turn
the scale in his favour. Not a word can now
be said against his character for gameness and
gluttony, for both which qualities he had
already earned for himself sufficient fame in
his passages with Paddock to remove any
stigma that his meetings with Orme might
have cast upon him. Most gamely did he
persevere while Sayers was fatigued to force
the milling and to wear out his antagonist;
but, owing to the great quickness and judgment
<a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a><span class="pageno">392</span>
of Tom, his efforts recoiled upon himself;
and, being unable to effect any punishment,
he did but reduce himself below the
level of the gallant Tom, and thus fall a prey
to his opponent’s superior judgment and
tactics.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Sayers’s triumphant <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coups d’essai</span> with two good “big ’uns” gave him an
open “perspective view” of the goal of his ambition&mdash;&#8203;the Championship&mdash;&#8203;an
honour never yet achieved by a middle-weight. With this view he
addressed a challenge to the redoubtable 13 stone Tipton Slasher, who then
claimed the belt; the Tipton having received forfeit in 1856 from Harry
Broome, who retired, and in the year 1857 from both Tom Paddock and
Aaron Jones.</p>

<p>Never since the memorable battle between Caunt and Bendigo, in Sept.,
1845, had there been a match which excited such general interest outside
the circle of regular supporters of true British boxing. Here was a man,
the acknowledged Champion of the Middle-weights, boldly throwing down
the gauntlet to the equally acknowledged Champion of England, and daring
him to combat for the title and reward to which for so long a time he had
laid claim without meeting an adversary of his own weight and inches daring
enough to deny his pretensions. Not a semblance of ill feeling was there
existing between the men, and we are glad to state that throughout, even
up to the very contest itself, they maintained towards one another the most
kindly sentiments. The only matter at issue between them was whether a
man of 5 feet 8½ inches, and under 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> in weight, possessed of whatever
science he might be, could contest, with any chance of success, against one
topping the 6 feet by half an inch, and weighing not less than 14<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> The
Slasher himself laughed at the idea of defeat, and stated to us his firm belief
that on entering the ring he would, in addition to his other advantages, be
found the cleverer man of the two. He said he had made up his mind not to
run all over the ring after his younger and more active opponent, but to take
his stand at the scratch, and await the onslaughts of the gallant Sayers.
This we (who knew the bold Tom’s capabilities) deemed a sound determination;
how far the burly Tiptonian adhered to it on entering the ring will
appear in the sequel. Sayers also, to some measure, made us his confidant
as to his intentions on the day of battle, and intimated that he believed the
Slasher was perfectly worn-out and incapable of anything like prolonged
exertion. He had fully made up his mind, he said, to keep him on his pins,
and lead him about the ring, by forcing the pace, until he should be so
exhausted as to be somewhat nearer his own mark. He, like the Slasher,
scorned the idea of defeat, and felt such intense confidence from the very
<a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a><span class="pageno">393</span>
day the match was made, that he invested almost every penny he possessed
upon the result of the encounter. The excitement in all quarters increased
week by week from the time the match was made, and in every sporting
circle the contest was made one of the great themes of discussion. The
general feeling at first appeared to be that Sayers had by his victory over
Aaron Jones got above himself, and that his overweening confidence would
lead him into unexpected difficulties, if, indeed, as was in many quarters
anticipated, the match did not end in a forfeit on his part. As the time
approached, however, and it was found that both men were in active work,
and evidently both meaning mischief, the doubts as to the match going on
vanished, the only point remaining for discussion being the foolhardiness
of Sayers, and the overweening confidence of his friends in allowing the
match to come to an issue for the full stakes. The Sayers party, however,
maintained their own opinion, and from first to last contended that the
Slasher was stale and out of practice, that he was destitute of scientific
acquirements, and so slow that any want of size and weight on the part of
his adversary was fully compensated for by these deficiencies. We believe
they never refused to take 6 to 4, and finally accepted 5 to 4 against their pet.</p>

<p>The doings of Tom’s gigantic opponent will be found in our fourth
Chapter. We have noted the awakening given to the Ring by the
announcement of the New Champion Belt, and the Slasher’s defiant challenge.
Tom accepted the terms, and Jemmy Massey immediately made the
match for the Tipton; the day being fixed for the 16th of June, 1857.
So soon as articles were signed, the Slasher, who was then keeping
a public-house in Spon Lane, Tipton, gave up his business and betook
himself to training at Boxmoor, where he got off some superfluous
flesh acquired in his calling as a Boniface; indeed when we saw him
one evening at Owen Swift’s he appeared to have been carefully prepared.
He was certainly not so hard and thin as we had seen him some
years before; but his complexion was fresh and his muscles well developed,
and he told us he “drew the balance at 14<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>” He expressed entire confidence,
and grinned good humouredly at the bare mention of defeat by so
small an opponent. The Tipton left London overnight to avoid interruption,
and was picked up on the downward voyage at Tilbury.</p>

<p>The stakeholder (the Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>) having to name the place of
fighting, proposed to charter two steamers; one to convey the men, their
seconds and friends, the other a select party of Corinthians; and for this
tickets were issued. At the last moment, however, the scheme miscarried,
<a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a><span class="pageno">394</span>
a special boat being unobtainable. A gentleman, however, offered a vessel
to start from Southend, with 250 passengers as a maximum number, on the
Tuesday morning, to convey the “excursionists” wherever they might wish
to go. This offer was gratefully accepted. The number was, subsequently,
limited to 200, including ring-keepers, men, and seconds. On arriving at
Southend, it was blowing a gale from the S.E., and there was a heavy sea
on. The boat could not come alongside the pier, and it was with great
difficulty that the passengers were able to get on board. It was upwards
of an hour before Tom Oliver and the ropes and stakes were got in.</p>

<p>When all were on board, the vessel steamed out to sea, and rounded the
Nore Light. The passage was anything but enjoyable to bad sailors, and
many offered their contributions to Neptune in the most liberal manner.
The passengers in the fore-part of the vessel were drenched with salt water,
but they bore the infliction with stoical good humour. The men entered
the ring between two and three, but just as all was arranged, the company
seated, and the dressing commenced, a bevy of blues was seen swiftly
approaching the ring. <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sauve qui peut</span> was the order of the day, and all
rushed off to the steamboats, many, in their anxiety, making for the wrong
vessel, and many mistakes consequently occurring. All, however, got on
board one or the other by three o’clock, and a move was made some miles
farther on to an island, where a second debarkation speedily took place.
Another ring was pitched, and round it were quickly ranged some 3,00
persons. The movements of the steamer had put all the frequenters of the
river on the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</span>, and the water was studded with boats and sailing
vessels of various sizes conveying their numerous freights to the scene of
action. The ground selected was excellent for milling purposes, and the
inner and outer rings were formed with as much expedition as possible, for
fear of further interruption. A good business was transacted in the sale of
inner-ring tickets, the amount realised by which was £47 2s. 6d. The
number of Corinthian sportsmen was the largest we remember at the ring-side,
and the spectators most orderly. At half-past four the men entered
the ring ready for business; Sayers attended by Nat Langham and Bill
Hayes, and the Slasher under the superintendence of Tass Parker and Jack
Macdonald, perhaps the best pair of seconds that could be found. No time
was cut to waste in preliminaries; the colours were tied to the stakes&mdash;&#8203;blue
and white spot for Sayers, and the old blue birdseye for the Slasher&mdash;&#8203;and
at twelve minutes to five they were delivered at the scratch, the betting
being 6 to 5 on the old one.

<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On toeing the scratch the
contrast between the men was, as may be
imagined, most extraordinary. The ould
Tipton topped his adversary at least four
inches, and it looked, to the uninitiated, “a
horse to a hen.” His immense frame and
ponderous, muscular arms and legs seemed
calculated to bear him to victory against
four such men as Sayers. He looked all full
of confidence, and evidently considered he
had a very easy little job before him. He
was thinner than we expected to see him,
and his condition generally was very fair,
but there were the usual indications of age
upon certain points where the fulness and
roundness of youth had disappeared from
his form. He looked all his age (thirty-eight);
indeed, by many he was thought to
be far on the shady side of forty. His attitude
was ungainly, but still he was rough
and ready, and the question that suggested
itself was “how was Sayers to get at him?”
Tom Sayers, as he advanced to meet his antagonist,
was the perfection of manly strength
and athletic development. His fine broad
shoulders, small loins, and powerful arms
and legs were all turned in one of Nature’s
best lathes, and there was not a fault to find,
unless it was found that he had two or three
pounds more flesh than was necessary about
his back and ribs. His attitude for attack
or defence was admirable, and however confident
the Slasher was, it was perfectly obvious
that Sayers was not one whit behind him
in that respect. The Slasher had evidently
made up his mind to set to work at once and
cut his man down in a jiffey. He lumbered
in like a huge bear, let go both hands with
more vigour than judgment, but did not get
home, and Sayers, in stepping back, fell, but
at once jumped up to renew the round.
The Slasher went at him, put in a little one
on the skull, and Tom again fell.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher came up evidently with
greater confidence than ever, and lunged out
his right, which reached Tom’s ribs with
great force, and Tom countered him sharply
on the mouth, drawing “first blood.” The
Slasher looked astonished, stopped to consider
a moment, and again went in, swinging
his great arms like the sails of a windmill.
Sayers danced lightly out of harm’s way,
and then, stepping in, popped a tidy smack
on the spectacle-beam, and got away laughing.
After dancing round his man, and
easily avoiding several more lunges, Tom
again got home on the snuffer-tray, removing
a piece of the japan, and drawing a fresh
supply of the ruby. The Tipton, annoyed,
rushed in, missed his right, and also a terrific
upper-cut with his left, and Sayers again
dropped in upon the nose. After this, slight
exchanges took place, the Slasher too slow
to be effective. He now chased Sayers all
over the ring, the latter dancing round him
like a wild Indian, or fleeing like a deer, to
draw him after him. The vicious blows
aimed by the Slasher all fell upon the air,
and his exertions to catch his nimble antagonist
caused him to blow off steam to an indefinite
extent. Had one of the intended
compliments alighted upon Tom, it looked
as if it would have been all over with him.
After Sayers had completed his dance he
went to his man, cleverly avoided a good
right-hander, and delivered another very
hot one on the proboscis (more “Lafitte”
of the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premier crû</span>). The Tipton tried his
heavy punches again three times and missed;
a fourth attempt was prettily stopped, after
which both hit short. The Tipton next got
on Tom’s right cheek with his left, but not
heavily, and some very pretty stopping followed
on both sides, after which the Tipton
made another rush like a bull at a gate, and
found himself once more battling with vacancy,
Tom having slipped under his arm,
and danced off laughing. The Slasher looked
with astonishment, and shook his nut.
Sayers again approached, and after one or
two feints a good exchange took place,
Sayers getting on to the left eye, and the
Slasher on the ribs. Sharp counter-hits followed,
Slasher on the mouth and Tom on the
cheek. Tom now led off with his double, but
the Slasher stopped him prettily twice in
succession, when he missed his return. The
Slasher again pounded away, principally with
his right, but without effect, as Sayers
jumped back or stopped every effort. Sayers
now planted a stinger with his left on the
mark and stopped the return. The next
minute he got sharply home on the nasal
organ, and jumped quickly away from a
well-intended upper-cut, which looked like
a finisher. The Slasher now stopped one or
two pretty leads, but his return came so
slowly that Sayers was far out of harm’s
way. This occurred several times, the Slasher
rushing about like a baited bull, Sayers
skipping and nimbly getting away from every
rush. After a little of this entertainment
Sayers went in, let go his left, and was
stopped neatly, and he, in turn, stopped two
very round hits on the part of Perry. Sayers
next feinted, and got home a slashing left-hander
on the right cheek, which he cut
severely, and drew a plenteous supply of
ruby. Another hit fell on the same spot.
The Slasher then got a little one on Tom’s
body, and tried again, but Tom got away.
The Slasher retired to his corner to get his
mug wiped, and, on coming out again, Tom
led him another dance all over the ring, the
Old One, with more haste than speed, trying
to catch him, and repeatedly expending his
strength in empty space. At last Sayers,
having given him a good turn at this game,
stopped to see whether he was pumped, and
some good exchanges followed, Sayers again
<a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a><span class="pageno">396</span>
on the damaged cheek, and the Slasher also
reaching the cheek. Mutual stopping followed,
and Sayers next got home heavily on
the olfactory projection. The Slasher now
stopped Tom, and returned, but not heavily,
on the top of his nut, which led to exchanges,
Tom on the left optic, and Bill on the ribs.
After one or two more exchanges, another
tremendous counter took place, Tom receiving
on the mouth, and the Slasher on the
nose, each drawing the carmine. The Slasher
having next made several misses went in, and
another sharp counter was exchanged, Tom
receiving on the brain-pan, and the Slasher
on the beak, from which more home-brewed
escaped. Each now had a wipe of the sponge,
and Tom treated his opponent to another
game of follow-my-leader all over the ring,
in the course of which the Slasher caught
him a heavy right-hander on the back. He
then stopped Tom’s left and heavy counters
followed Tom on the nose, and Slasher on
the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">os frontis</span>, knocking him down (first
“knock down” for Slasher). This round
lasted nearly half an hour.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher came up laughing, but he
was evidently bent on mischief. Sayers
smiled, tried his left and was stopped, and
the Slasher, as usual, missed two swinging
right-handers. Tom dodged, popped his left
on the mark, and then on the forehead, got
a little one on the ribs, and exchanges followed,
Tom getting home on the left ogle,
and Tipton on the mouth. Some heavy give
and take fighting followed, Tom getting more
juice from the Slasher’s right cheek, and
receiving one or two smart ones on the neck
and side of his head. Mutual stopping, feinting
and dodging until Tom got home on the
mark, and the Slasher again followed him
all over the ring, hitting out of distance, and
with no manner of judgment. Finding he
could do nothing, the Slasher put down his
hands, and retired for another wipe from
Jack Macdonald, and then renewed his exertions,
when some pretty stopping took place
on both sides, after which Sayers got
home on the left side of the nob, but was
stopped in another essay. The Slasher
stopped two more well-intended ones, and
then got home on the side of Tom’s cranium;
Sayers returned now heavily on the proboscis,
once more turning on the tap. Tom
now dodged, and then got home heavily on
the damaged cheek&mdash;&#8203;a tremendous hit, and
again did the home-brewed appear. The
Slasher retired to be cleaned, and came
again viciously, but Sayers pinked him on
the smeller, receiving a slight return on the
top of the nob. More futile efforts on the
part of the Slasher, whose friends called
upon Sayers to stand still and be hit, but
Tom wisely declined. He had orders to
keep his man on his legs and fight him at
long shots, and these orders he carried out
most excellently. Again and again did
the Slasher miss or get stopped. Occasionally
he got home a very little one, which did
not leave a mark, and now he rushed at
Tom, dashed out his right, and very narrowly
escaped smashing his fist against the stake&mdash;&#8203;it
was within an inch. Sayers lifted up his
arms with astonishment, and stood laughing
until the Slasher wore round on another
tack, and came at him again, when Tom got
away, shaking his noddle and grinning.
The Slasher followed, Tom nailed him
on the nozzle, stopped his return, and then
planted another on the cheek. Sharp exchanges
followed, the Slasher getting
on Tom’s right cheek and just drawing the
juice, while Tom left a mark on the Slasher’s
left eye. The Old’un, very slow, sparred
apparently for wind, and was then stopped
left and right, after which each hit over
the shoulder. Tom afterwards stopped
both hands, and got easily away from a
third attempt. Slight exchanges followed,
Tom on the nose, and Slasher on the top of
the head. More dancing by Sayers, and
exhausting efforts on the part of the
Slasher, and then as the Slasher came,
Tom caught him a severe straightener
on the snuff-box, drawing lots of claret.
The Slasher, savage, stood to consider, and
then rushing in delivered a little one on the
side of Tom’s head with his right, and Tom
fell. (Time, 52 minutes.)</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher came up grinning, but
he was evidently somewhat fatigued by his
exertions. He nevertheless adhered to his
practice of forcing the fighting, again dashed
at Tom, and contrived to plant a little one
on the body with his right, but it was not
within punishing distance. Slight exchanges
followed on the side of the wig-block,
after which the Slasher stopped Tom’s
left. Heavy counter-hits next succeeded
in favour of Sayers, who got home on the
Slasher’s potato-trap, and napped a little
one on the nob. After another dance round
the ring, Tom stopped the Slasher’s right,
and the latter then drove him into the
corner, and, evidently thinking he had him
safe, wound himself up to finish; but when
he let go his left and right, he found that
Tom had slipped under his arm, and was
laughing at him in the middle of the ring.
The K-legged giant, irate that his opponent
would not stand to be hit, again lumbered
after him, like an elephant in pumps, but it
was no go. “No catchee, no havee,” was
Tom’s maxim, and he kept to his active
tactics. The Slasher persevered, and Sayers
stopped his left and right, and then
turned away laughing and shaking his noddle.
The Tipton giant could not make
it out, and turned to his second as if to
inquire what he should do; another illustration
of the classical adage&mdash;&#8203;<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">capit consilium
gladiator in arena</span>. At last he went at it
again and got home on the body, receiving
in return on the kisser. Some sparring followed,
until the Tipton again led off, and
was short with both hands. Finding he
could do nothing, he retired to his corner,
<a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a><span class="pageno">397</span>
where he stood leaning on the ropes, Tom
waiting and beckoning him to the scratch.
After a rest the Slasher came out, feinted
at Tom, but was quickly nailed on the left
cheek. He tried again, and got home
heavily on the ribs, and Sayers fell. (Time,
one hour and four minutes.)</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Perry still adhered to his boring tactics,
but Tom was far too quick on his pins,
and easily avoided him. Another attempt
was stopped, and from a third Sayers got
easily away. A fourth was missed, and Tom
returned on the left cheek, which led to
heavy exchanges on the side of the head,
and Tom fell, the Slasher falling over him.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher came up laughing, and let
go his left, but out of distance; good exchanges
followed, Sayers effecting another
lodgment on the right cheek, and increasing
the cut in that quarter, and the Slasher
getting home on the cranium. The Slasher,
after another ill-directed rush, again retired
to his corner, had a drink and a wipe, and
then came again, when Sayers stopped his
deliveries with the greatest ease. The
Slasher persevered, and Tom led him
another morris-dance, but they afterwards
got close, and slight exchanges ended in the
Slasher falling.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;The Tipton bored in stooping, head-foremost,
like a bull of Salamanca. Tom,
not being provided with a mantilla to throw
over his head, jumped aside like a matador,
and on went his assailant to the ropes.
Perry swung round, just got on to Tom’s head,
and each then missed a blow. The Slasher
persevered, and Tom countered on the left
side of his forehead with his right, after
which Perry retired to his corner, whither
Sayers followed him, and the Slasher at
once lunged out at the cheek, but not effectually.
He now made another of his wild
onslaughts, but only to be disappointed,
and he next stopped both Tom’s mauleys.
Some sparring followed, both being slightly
blown; the Slasher stopped Tom’s left,
and returned with his right on the body.
After a few more misses, they got close,
and Tom delivered a heavy spank on the
left eye, and fell from the force of his own
blow. (One hour, fifteen minutes.)</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Perry showed a bump under the
left peeper, but he came up smiling, and
let go his left and right, both of which
were stopped. He then stood blowing,
until Sayers went to the attack, and
some mutual pretty stopping took place,
followed by several misses on either side.
The Slasher once more retired to rest in his
corner, but was fetched out by Sayers, who
then got home on the side of the nob, and
neatly avoided a return. Both were now
rather wild in their lunges, and the Slasher,
who pursued his man most vigorously,
repeatedly missed his blows. Tom at length
caught him on the cutwater, drawing a fresh
supply from the best bin, and the Slasher
walked off to borrow Jack Macdonald’s wipe.
Tom followed, and got home very heavily
on the mark and then on the mouth, renewing
“the cataract from the cavern.” Sharp
exchanges in favour of Sayers followed, and
in the end both fell.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher came up slowly. Notwithstanding
his severe punishment, his
seconds sent him up beautifully clean, and
in fact their attention throughout was beyond
all praise. He tried again and again to
plant upon the agile Sayers, but in vain.
Sayers stopped him at all points, and then
delivered a heavy left-hander on the mark.
Some sparring followed, and Sayers stopped
several heavy lunges, the Tipton in return
stopping his left. Tom, in another attempt,
got on the damaged cheek, increasing the
cut, and the Tipton walked to his corner,
whither Tom followed him, but on the
Slasher making his usual lunge Sayers
jumped back. Perry followed, and some
pretty taps and stops, without mischief, took
place. The Slasher then hit out of distance
several times in succession, but on getting
close some neat exchanges followed, Tom on
the mark, heavily, and Perry on the cheek,
but not effectively. Perry once more bored
in, and delivered his right, but it was a mere
fly-blow. Tom missed his prop with the left,
and the Slasher retired for a drink. Tom
thought this an example worth following,
and after the inner man was refreshed, they
went to work again, and sharp exchanges,
all in favour of Sayers, followed; he kept
playing on the Slasher’s damaged nose and
cheek, his double being very effective, while
Perry’s blows appeared to leave no mark.
Tom now stopped several well-intended
blows, and returned heavily on the right
cheek with his left. Perry, although getting
slower every minute, gamely persevered,
put in his right and left on the body, and
then hit short with both hands. More
mutual stopping ensued, until they got close,
when the Slasher dashed his right at the
body, but Tom met him with a very straight
left-hander on the mouth, drawing more of
the elixir of life, and with his right he
planted severely on the nose. Another
sharp one on the mouth caused the Slasher
to stagger and fall, and Tom fell over him.
The Slasher evidently was fast going; the
last three blows, particularly the right-hander,
were very heavy, and the game old
fellow was almost abroad, and was very slow
to time.</p>

<p>     10 and last.&mdash;&#8203;The Slasher crawled very
slowly to the scratch, and attempted to lead
off. It was, however, only an attempt.
Tom easily avoided it, and planted a tremendous
hit on the mark, stopping the
return with ease. He stopped two more
attempts, and then as the Slasher lunged
out a third time he caught him with the left
on the damaged cheek and the right on the
mouth, cutting his upper lip very severely,
and the Slasher fell, Tom on him. The
Slasher was carried to his corner, and, with
<a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a><span class="pageno">398</span>
some difficulty, was got round in time to go
to the scratch for another round. His dial,
however, was dreadfully punished, and his
lip was so much cut that he presented a
piteous appearance. It was evident that he
had not the slightest chance; he was as
weak as a kitten, and entirely at the mercy
of his adversary, who was perfectly scatheless
and apparently as active as when he
began, and Owen Swift, the Slasher’s principal
backer, seeing the state of things,
stepped into the ring, and with praiseworthy
humanity declared that he should fight no
more. Perry was very unwilling to give up
without one more shy, but Owen was imperative.
He insisted upon the men shaking
hands, and the sponge was thrown up, Tom
Sayers being proclaimed the winner, and
Champion of England, amid the cheers of
his partisans, at the expiration of one hour
and forty-two minutes.</p>

<p>     No time was now lost in getting on board
the vessels, the majority of the spectators
making for the larger vessel, for which they
had no tickets, and taking advantage of the
absence of the authorities on shore to
scramble on board before demands could be
made upon them to show their credentials.
The charterers of the “Widgeon” (the companion
or rather opposition), did not display
much consideration for their patrons, as they
steamed off almost immediately on the conclusion
of the mill, leaving the majority of
their customers to their fate.</p>

<p>     It was fortunate for Sayers that he finished
his task at the time he did, for scarcely
had the men left the ring when the same
body of peelers who had before interfered
arrived upon the ground, just in time to be
too late to put their kind intentions into
effect. It was only the difficulty in getting
a boat that prevented their arrival at an
earlier hour.</p>

<p>     As soon as all were on board the regular
boat a consultation was held as to the course
that ought to be pursued, and the general
opinion having been taken, it was resolved
to make for Strood, instead of giving the
navigators another turn round the Nore, and
by eight o’clock a landing was effected at
that town, and nearly all were enabled to
reach town by eleven o’clock in the evening.
On the voyage to Strood, Tom Sayers went
round among the Corinthians and made a
collection for his fallen but game opponent,
which amounted to the sum of £22 5s.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;The account of this battle
tells its own tale, and calls for scarcely any
remarks. From first to last it was evident
that the Tipton Slasher’s star had sunk, and
that he was no longer “The Slasher.” He
must have felt from the very first that, barring
an accident, he had not the slightest
chance. All his quickness and activity had
left him, and we could not help thinking
that his eyesight also must be failing, for
times out of number did he lunge out and
attempt to deliver upper-cuts when Tom
Sayers was far beyond his reach, and these
blows were of such tremendous force that
they must have tended to take much of the
steel out of him. It appeared to us that from
the very beginning he adopted a wrong
principle. For a heavy, lumbering man, like
himself, to attempt to force the fighting, and
pursue a lithe, active fellow such as Sayers,
was perfectly ridiculous, as he evidently felt
towards the conclusion of the battle; and we
should imagine that he must many times
since have regretted that he did not adhere
to his original intention of awaiting the
attack and depending upon his powers as a
counter-hitter to bring him through. That
he did his best to please his backers and to
bring the fight off in his favour cannot for a
moment be denied, and that he took his
severe punishment without a murmur was
self-evident. He always had the character
of being a game man, and that character he
carried with him into retirement. The
Tipton said that early in the fight he injured
his right hip in one of his sudden twists to
catch his opponent, and this materially
interfered with his powers. Tom Sayers
fought strictly to orders throughout, and
his coolness and judgment greatly enhanced
his reputation among his friends. Some
persons present commented upon his retreating
tactics, and contended that this was
not fair fighting, but as these remarks proceeded
from the enemy’s camp they are
worth but little. Of course it would have
been infinitely more pleasing to them had
Tom stood and slogged away against an
adversary of so much heavier metal until he
was disabled by a chance blow, but such a
course would have been perfect madness on
his part. How his jumping or running away
could be called unfair, so long as he confined
himself within the ring, we cannot conceive.
The ring is always constructed of a certain
size for the express purpose of restraining
the combatants within certain bounds, and
within those bounds a man has a perfect
right to retreat and jump about as long as
he likes, so that he does not decline to face
his opponent; and that Tom Sayers for one
moment declined to continue the battle cannot
by any one be maintained. How far his
jumping about and exertions upon his legs
were advisable for his own sake is another
question, and we are inclined to think that
he might have kept out of harm’s way with
far less exertion, and reserved much of his
strength against any unlooked-for contingency,
had he restrained his peristaltic
energies within more reasonable bounds. If
the Slasher had been younger and more
active, it is not improbable that the gallant
Tom would have found out to his cost, as
the battle progressed, the benefit of such a
mode of fighting. As it turned out, however,
no harm was done, and as he achieved such
an easy victory, none of his friends can for
one moment complain. That his retreating
arose from any want of confidence is a proposition
not to be entertained for a moment.
<a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a><span class="pageno">399</span>
Never in his brilliant career has he shown
the semblance of the white feather, and we
feel assured that the only causes to which
his method of fighting the Slasher can be
set down are caution, a desire to please his
friends, and an extraordinary exuberance of
animal spirits. The ring throughout the
fight was well kept, and, beyond the few
vicissitudes connected with the voyage to
the scene of action, we heard of nothing
calculated to mar the pleasures of the day.</p>

<p>Tom’s defeat of the ponderous Tipton was not, however, to leave him in
undisputed possession of the belt. Tom Paddock considered himself
capable of taking the shine out of such a little one, and challenged Sayers
accordingly; but ere a match could be arranged, the Redditch man was
suddenly seized with a rheumatic fever, which completely floored him, and
from which it was feared he would not recover. There was now apparently
every chance that Sayers would walk over the course, but this did
not suit Harry Broome, who, although unable to cope with Tom himself,
“thought he knowed a cove wot could,” and made a match for an “Unknown,”
to fight Tom for £200 a side on the 5th of January, 1858. The
speculations as to who this unknown could be were extraordinary&mdash;&#8203;he was
the bold Bendy, he was Ben Caunt, he was Ould Nat, he was Harry
Orme&mdash;&#8203;in fact, he was everybody but himself; and great indeed was the
public astonishment when it became known that he was not only actually
an “Unknown,” but also a perfect novice, being, in fact, Bill Bainge, or
Benjamin, a native of Northleach, 5<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> 10¾in. in height, weighing 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, of
whose prowess rumour had propagated extravagant accounts, while others
maintained that as the Broomes were behind Benjamin, it was a “got-up”
robbery, and that Sayers would “chuck it.” Poor Tom was sadly mortified
at these insinuations, and indignantly assured the writer that if he
should be beaten it should only be by a better man.</p>

<p>A steamboat conveyed the men and their backers down the river to the
Isle of Grain, where, at about half-past twelve o’clock, the Champion made
his appearance at the ring-side, and modestly dropped his castor within
the ropes, following it at once himself, attended by Bill Hayes and Harry
Brunton. He was hailed with loud cheers from all sides. Bill Benjamin
was close upon his heels, and stepped into the ropes under the care of
Harry Broome and Jemmy Massey. There was a smile upon the face of
each man; but we fancied that of Sayers was the genuine smile of confidence,
while that of his opponent had somewhat of a nervous twist about it.
They shook hands good humouredly, tossed for corners, Sayers proving the
winner, and then at once commenced peeling to the bitter frost and south-easterly
breeze. The colours, a neat French grey for Sayers, and blue and
white spots for Benjamin, were now tied to the stakes, the usual preliminaries
<a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a><span class="pageno">400</span>
were quickly settled, and at fourteen minutes to twelve “time”
was called. The betting round the ring was very slight, 2 to 1 being
freely offered, but takers were scarce at anything under 5 to 2.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;When the men appeared at
the scratch, which they did in the midst of
perfect silence, there was a visible contrast
in their physical powers. The Novice stood
well over Sayers, his muscles were larger
and better developed, and altogether he
looked, as he undoubtedly was, the heavier
and more powerful man. His attitude at first
was good, and led one to suppose he had
studied under a good master. His condition
was perfect, there not being a superfluous
ounce about him. Tom looked rather fleshy
about the chest and shoulders, but in such
weather it was perhaps a fault on the right
side. His attitude was the same as ever&mdash;&#8203;cool,
calm, and collected. He eyed his
adversary with steadiness, and there was
the same unmistakable glance of confidence
always to be seen on his mug. He had
clearly made up his mind to let the Novice
make the first move, and tried several dodges
to draw him out. The Novice, although
evidently nervous, sparred and feinted like
an accomplished boxer for a brief period,
and at length tried his left, but Tom stopped
him with nonchalance, and returned quickly
with the left on the nozzle, and then on the
mark a sharp crack. The Novice stood his
ground, and now succeeded in stopping Tom
twice, and returning, but very slightly, on the
cheek. Tom next delivered his left and
right at close quarters, on the cheek and
jaw, and the Novice dropped. He was conveyed
to his corner, and the look of dismay
upon his countenance as he glanced around
was perfectly ludicrous. It was at once
patent to all that he knew nothing of the
business he had undertaken, and that the
contest was virtually over, for directly his
guard was broken through he appeared to
have no resources. He could not use his
legs, and his arms flew about like the sails
of a windmill, so that Tom was able to put
in both hands perfectly at his ease. The
celerity with which he brought his right into
play thus early in the fight was remarkable.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;The Novice did not “smile as he was
wont to smile,” but seemed to be on the
look-out for a place of secure retreat. Tom
walked quietly up, led off with his left and
was stopped, but the Novice missed his return.
Tom then popped his left very heavily
on the mouth, knocking his opponent clean
off his pins, and filling his potato trap with
ruby. The Novice lay as if undecided for a
second, and then, turning over, got gradually
on his pins, and his seconds took him to
his corner. He shook his head several
times, and appeared extremely undesirous
of encountering another of Tom’s heavy
shots, but, on time being called, Harry                                                                                  y
Broome pushed him forward, and he went
reluctantly to the scratch, Massey, in disgust,
having declined to have any more to
do with him.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers, evidently bent on making
short work of it, quickly went to work left
and right. Benjamin tried to rally with
him, but beyond an accidental touch on the
lip, did not reach him. Tom planted heavily
on the mouth and jaw, drawing more ruby,
and down went the Novice all abroad. He
lay in the middle of the ring, and nothing
could persuade him to come to “time.”
Broome then threw up the sponge, and Tom
Sayers was once again proclaimed the conqueror,
and still champion, in <em>six minutes
and a half</em>, the battle&mdash;&#8203;if battle it could be
called where it was all one way&mdash;&#8203;being the
most bloodless we ever witnessed. The
Novice, on being asked to account for his
cutting up so badly, said he was hit very
hard in the mark in the first round, and not
expecting to be hit there, it had made him
very sick and incapable of exerting himself.
Further than that he knew not. His easy
defeat struck dismay into all his friends, and
the look of surprise and contempt cast upon
him by Jemmy Massey was a study for an
artist. Both men at once left the field of
action, and repaired on board the boat, where
they lost no time in resuming their warm
wraps, and taking other means to infuse a
little of that caloric into their systems which
had been subtracted therefrom during their
brief exposure to the outward air.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;We question whether it is not
an insult to the understanding of the reader
to offer any remarks upon this singular exhibition
of incapacity upon the part of the
would-be champion. Of Tom Sayers we
have nothing more to say than he did what
he was called upon to do with the utmost
<span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nonchalance</span>, and that he performed his task
even easier than he had all along anticipated.
The Novice did not exhibit a single point
which would entitle him to be called even
an “outsider.” From the time that he was
foiled in his very first move he cannot be
said to have even “tried.” All his senses
seemed to have left him, and, as far as we
were able to judge, the only predominant
thought in his mind was how to escape from
the dilemma in which he had been placed,
with the least damage to himself. Doubtless
he was hit very heavily, but still he
had not received even half enough to justify
him in crying “a go,” had he meant winning
<a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a><span class="pageno">401</span>
at all hazards. That he must eventually
have been beaten by such a man as Sayers,
barring an accident, is a positive certainty,
and that he exercised a sound discretion in
not submitting to further punishment is
equally true; but that he has done more
than heap ridicule upon himself and those
who brought him out, by his miserable performance,
is a proposition not to be disputed
for a moment. How such a judge of fighting
as Harry Broome could have made the mistake
he did we cannot understand, but the
task of bringing out a candidate for the
Championship once undertaken by a man of
his known “talent,” it is easy to understand
how the public were induced to come forward
and take the long odds offered on Sayers.
Among the deceived was the renowned
Jemmy Massey, who, liking the appearance
of the man, and being led on by the reports
of Harry Broome as to his man’s cleverness
and gluttonous qualities, took the odds of
2 to 1 to a considerable amount. The whole
affair was carried out from first to last in a
quiet and orderly way, and there was no
fault to find with the partisans of either
man for either unseemly language or noisy
demonstrations. All that was required to
render it a model fight was a little more
devil and resolution on the part of the loser.
The battle money was handed to Tom Sayers
at Owen Swift’s, “Horse Shoe” Tavern,
Tichborne Street, on Wednesday evening,
January 13th, when he was again adorned
with the Champion’s belt, which, according
to rule, was deposited with the stakeholder
to abide the event of his next battle for the
permanent possession of the trophy.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>After this victory Tom appeared in a fair way to rest upon his laurels,
but soon, to his astonishment, as well as every one else’s, it was announced
that Tom Paddock had recovered, and did not intend to let the belt pass
without a struggle. He issued a challenge to Sayers, in which he intimated
that, it being dead low water in his exchequer, he was as poor as a church
mouse, and that unless Tom would extend him the hand of charity, and
meet him for £150 a side, instead of the stipulated £200, the darling wish
of his heart could not be gratified. He thought he could win the belt, and
hoped Tom would not let a paltry £50 stand between them and prevent a
friendly mill. Sayers, like a “brick” of his own laying, promptly responded
to the call, and intimated that the meeting would afford him the
highest gratification. With such an old pal he could not allow the paltry
“rag” to stand in the way. The match was at once made, and came off
on the anniversary of Tom’s fight with the Slasher&mdash;&#8203;<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, on the 16th of
June, 1858. After some narrow escapes from police pursuit and persecution,
the two Toms met on a place selected as “maiden ground,” at Canvey
Island.</p>

<p>And here the phrase, “the two Toms,” tempts us to a brief digression.
The baptismal name of “Tom” has, indeed, furnished more than its calculable
proportion of Champions of the fistic Ring; and hence we have
pictured on a previous page the “three Toms” whose deeds made their
names, in the first three-quarters of the present century, among admirers
of pugilistic prowess, “familiar in men’s mouths as household words.”
This curious pre-eminence of name may be further extended; for though
the Christian name of John, the familiar Jack, and the royal one of
George (during the reign of “the four Georges”) twice outnumbered the
<a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a><span class="pageno">402</span>
Toms, yet Tom Johnson, Tom Paddock, Tom Sayers, and Tom King&mdash;&#8203;the
<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultimus Romanorum</span>&mdash;&#8203;make up the mystic number of Seven Champions
bearing that designation, while Jack Broughton, John Jackson, and John
Gully are the only three to be credited to the far more numerous family
of “Johns.”</p>

<p>The first to shy his wide-awake into the ring was Tom Paddock, who
was loudly cheered. He was attended by Jemmy Massey and that accomplished
master of the art Jack Macdonald, and looked as red as beet-root,
and as strong and healthy as though he had never in the course of his life
assisted at the ceremony of turning off the gas. His demeanour was the
same as ever, that of extreme confidence, and the smile on his mug was
more that of one who had merely come out to enjoy a little gentle exercise
than of a candidate for honours preparing to meet the Admirable Crichton
of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> There was, however, nothing of bravado about him; he
merely took the affair as a matter of course, which would soon be over. He
was not kept many minutes before he was joined by his opponent, who,
attended by Bill Hayes and Harry Brunton, was also received with a complete
ovation of applause. Tom, like his brother Tom, also looked in rude
health, but his good-tempered mug struck us as if anything too fleshy, and
in this we were confirmed when he stripped, for it was then apparent that he
was some three or four pounds heavier than he should have been under
such a tropical sun. The lads shook hands good-humouredly, and while
they were completing their half-finished adornments, the betting round the
ring was of the liveliest and heaviest description: £25 to £20, £50 to £40,
and similar odds to smaller sums upon Sayers were offered and eagerly
accepted in all quarters, and it was as much as the stakeholder could
accomplish for some time to collect and enter the names and amounts of
perhaps some of the heaviest investments for many years.</p>

<p>We feel it incumbent upon us here to perform an act of justice to Alec
Keene, which speaks volumes for his kindness of heart, and without which
our account would be incomplete. After the men had been fighting about
twenty minutes, Alec, who had followed the belligerents in a tug from
Gravesend, made his appearance on the ground, and, finding that things
were not going altogether smoothly with Tom Paddock, at once betook
himself to his corner, offered him the hand of fellowship, and throughout the
remainder of the fight stood by him, to afford him the benefit of that experience
and advice which he is so capable of imparting.

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Both came grinning to the
scratch, and manœuvred for a brief space for
an opening. Paddock looked, as usual, big
and burly, but it was evident he was no
longer the active, fresh man we had before
seen. His mug was more marked with age,
and there was a dulness about his eye
we never remember in former days. His
condition was good and he was in good
health, but still he looked only Tom Paddock
in name. Sayers was more fleshy than
he should have been, but this was the only
fault to be found with him. His eye was as
bright and clear as a hawk’s, and the ease of
his movements was a picture to behold. His
attitude was, as usual, all readiness for a
shoot or a jump. Paddock, instead of rushing,
as had been expected, steadied himself,
and felt with his left for an opening. It
was not long before he attempted it, but
Sayers stopped him easily. He made a
second attempt, and Sayers stepped back,
shaking his noddle and laughing. After a
little sparring, Paddock tried again, and got
on Tom’s brow, but not heavily. Again
they dodged, and at length two counter-hits
were exchanged, each getting on to the proboscis.
After this Paddock again reached
Tom’s nozzle rather sharply, but was stopped
in another attempt. Another bit of cautious
sparring eventually led to very heavy
exchanges, in which Sayers left a mark on
Paddock’s left cheek, and napped a warm
one over the right peeper, slightly removing
the bark, and giving Paddock the first event.
Several rapid passes were now made on both
sides, but they were evidently mere trials to
find out what each intended. After a pause
Sayers tried his favourite double, which he
succeeded in landing on Paddock’s cheek,
but not very heavily. More sharp exchanges
followed, the advantage being with Sayers,
until they both retreated and stood to cool
themselves, the heat being intense. After a
few seconds thus employed, they again approached
one another smiling, and after a
dodge or two they exchanged slight reminders
on the side of the nut, broke away, and
then got at it again, when heavy counter-hits
were exchanged, but Sayers was first,
and inflicted a cut on Paddock’s left brow,
calling forth the juice in abundance. Paddock
landed on the cheek, but not heavily.
After this slight exchanges with the left
took place, and they again stood, Sayers
awaiting the onslaught, and Paddock puzzled.
At last the latter dashed in, and was easily
stopped twice in succession. He rushed
after Sayers, who ducked under his arm,
and, as Paddock turned round again, nailed
him very heavily over the left peeper, renewed
the supply of carmine, and then got out of
harm’s way. Paddock, nothing daunted,
dashed in, but Sayers stopped him most
beautifully, and then, putting in his double,
got well on the old spot. Paddock once
more bored in, and was neatly stopped, but,
persevering with his usual gameness, heavy
exchanges ensued, all in favour of Sayers,
who was as straight as a die, and got heavily
on the left cheek and brow. Paddock, wild,
rushed after him; Sayers ducked, and then
planted his left on the left cheek, another
hot one, and then on the snout, renewing the
ruby. As Paddock bored in, he made a cannon
off the cushion by putting his double
heavily on the mark and nose without a return,
and Paddock then rushing after him,
bored him down. This round lasted fifteen
minutes, and at its conclusion the backers
of Sayers offered 2 to 1&mdash;&#8203;an offer not accepted
by the Paddock party, who looked
indigo. It was patent to all good judges
even thus early that Paddock was only Paddock
in name, and that all the steel was out
of him; and he has since informed us that
he felt tired and worn out, and that he had
no chance from this time. His gameness,
therefore, in persevering so long and so manfully
against his own conviction is the more
commendable.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Both came up grinning, but while
Sayers was almost scatheless, Paddock’s mug
showed that Sayers had been there. Paddock,
nothing daunted, rattled in, and got
on to the top of Tom’s nob. Sayers returned,
but not heavily and sharp counter-hits followed,
Sayers on the damaged ogle, and
Paddock on the left cheek. After this,
Sayers got home his dangerous right on the
side of Paddock’s nob, and the latter fell.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock seemed slow, while Sayers
was as fresh as a daisy; Paddock attempted
to lead, but was very short. He, however,
stopped Tom’s return. Heavy exchanges
followed, Sayers receiving on the left cheek,
and getting heavily on Paddock’s damaged
squinter. Paddock, nothing daunted, made
several desperate efforts, but Sayers got
away with the greatest ease, and at length, as
Paddock persevered, he once more countered
him on the old spot, drawing more of the
red port, and stopped Paddock’s return.
Twice again did Sayers repeat this visitation,
and get away from Paddock’s kindly intentions.
Sayers then tried to lead off, but
was well stopped. He made another attempt,
and lodged his favourite double on the mark
and nose, and then stopped Paddock’s return.
Paddock now endeavoured to force
the fighting, but Sayers danced away under
his arm, came again, and, as Paddock rushed
in, delivered a tremendous left-hander on
the cheek, by the side of the smeller, drawing
more home-brewed from the fresh cut.
Paddock, angry, made several desperate
efforts, but was well-stopped. At length
they got close, and in the heavy exchanges,
Sayers got his right heavily on the side of
the nut, and received on the mouth. Paddock
<a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a><span class="pageno">404</span>
now dashed in, and although Sayers
pinked him on the nose and eye, he persevered
until he forced Sayers down.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock’s physog. seemed a good deal
out of the line of beauty, while Sayers had
scarcely a mark. Paddock still smiled, and
attempted to lead, but the dash and vigour
we remember of yore were all gone; his blows
seemed but half-arm hits, and did not get
near their destination. Almost every time
Sayers stopped him with ease, and at last,
as Paddock came boring in, he met him
heavily on the cheek, producing another
streak of cochineal. Still did Paddock persevere
but only to be nailed again, and to
have the Red Republican once more called
forth. After this he got home on Tom’s
chest, and then on the cheek, but the blows
lacked vigour. Exchanges ensued, in which
Paddock removed the bark from Tom’s
sniffer, and turned on the main, but it was
not a material damage. After a rest, in
which both piped for wind, they again got
at it, and a tremendous rally took place, in
which Sayers was straightest and heaviest;
he, however, got a hot’un on the mouth,
which drew the Badminton. This was a
tremendous give-and-take round, and Paddock
caught it heavily on the left side of his
nob, while Sayers received chiefly on the
hardest parts of his cast-iron canister. In
the end Paddock was down, amidst the vociferous
cheers of the Sayers party.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock made two ineffectual attempts
to deliver, each being short, after which
Sayers missed his favourite double. He
then stopped Paddock’s one, two, and exchanges
followed, in which Paddock reached
Tom’s chin, and received with interest on
the damaged cheek. Again did they deliver
left and right, and Paddock drew more
gravy from Tom’s sucker. Paddock rattled
to it, but Sayers countered heavily on the
snorer, again calling forth the ruby; he,
however, napped one on the kisser, which
must have shaken his false ivories. After
this they piped for wind, the perspiration
oozed from every pore, and they were evidently
both tired. Paddock retired for a
wipe, and after a pause Sayers went to him,
and Paddock, seeing this, rushed in but
Tom danced away, followed by Paddock,
who eventually got a reminder on the cheek,
and Sayers, in getting away from the return,
fell.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers feinted and dodged until Paddock
came to him, when Tom got home a
very hot one on the snuff-box, turning on
the vermilion galore. Paddock, wild, dashed
at him to deliver the right, but Sayers getting
quickly out of mischief, the blow fell
on the stake, and evidently caused the poor
fellow intense pain. He was not cowed,
however, but followed Sayers, who fell, and
Paddock’s umpire appealing, the referee desired
Sayers to be cautious.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock slow, came up cautiously,
and after a few dodges, led off, but was
short, and received a reminder on the beak
from Tom’s left. Sayers then got heavily
on the mark with the left, and stopped the
return. This led to heavy exchanges, in
which Paddock received on the nose, and
lost more juice, while Sayers only got it on
the brow. Paddock tried again and again to
lead off, but Sayers danced away, or ducked
under his arm, and each time nailed him
heavily on the nose or left cheek, and,
finally, Paddock fell weak.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock’s left peeper was now completely
closed, and the left side of his knowledge-box
much swollen. He was sent up very
clean, however, and again tried to lead off,
but Sayers was too quick for him, and got
away. Still did the gallant Paddock persevere,
but Sayers stopped him with ease, and
returned on the damaged visual organ very
heavily. Paddock again dashed in, but was
short, his blows lacking vigour; and Sayers
returned on the mark. Again and again did
Paddock make an onslaught, but there was
none of the vigour of the Paddock of former
days; he was repeatedly stopped with ease,
and Sayers caught him again and again on
the mark and damaged chop. At last they
got close together, and Paddock succeeded
in knocking Sayers off his pins by a heavy
right-hander on the whistler, which inflicted
a severe cut, and drew the carmine (loud
cheers for Paddock, who had thus won the
two first events).</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;The blow in the last round had evidently
shaken Sayers, who was slow to the
call of time, and came up with a suspicious
mark on his potato-trap. Paddock tried to
follow up his advantage and incautiously
went in, when Sayers met him with a beautiful
left-hander on the snout, which sent
him staggering, and put an end to his rushing
for the time. This enabled Sayers to
recover a little, and then, as Paddock afterwards
came in, he made another call on the
cheek, and got cleverly away from the
return. Paddock followed him up, and
heavy left-handed exchanges took place in
favour of Sayers, who afterwards stopped
Paddock’s right twice in succession. Good
exchanges ensued to a close, and Paddock
got down, just escaping Tom’s right.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;After slight harmless exchanges, they
stood piping, until Paddock took the initiative,
but Sayers danced under his arm, and,
as he turned round, pinked him on the
blind goggle, and then, putting in his double,
renewed the home-brewed from the cheek.
Paddock tried a return, but was stopped
twice in succession, and then got another
little ’un on the out-water. After some
neat stopping on both sides, Sayers made
another call on the cheek, then on the chest,
and after sharp exchanges, as Paddock
rushed after him, he slipped and fell, but
obviously from accident.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock at once rushed to close
quarters, but found Sayers nothing loth;
they struggled for a brief period, and in the
<a name="Page_405" id="Page_405"></a><span class="pageno">405</span>
end both fell, it being obvious that Sayers
was the stronger man.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, who was piping and evidently
fatigued, tried to lead off, but was
miserably short. After a slight exchange
they again closed, and, after a short struggle,
Sayers threw and fell on his man, amidst
the cheers of his admirers. One hour and
two minutes had now elapsed.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, whose mug was all shapes
but the right, and whose remaining goggle
glared most ferociously, rushed in and
missed. Sayers, in getting back, fell, and
there was a claim of foul; Massey and Macdonald,
according to the custom of modern
seconds, neglecting their man, and rushing
to the referee. There was not the slightest
ground for the claim, Sayers evidently
having fallen from pure accident; but
the usual complimentary remarks were
offered by the card-sharpers and other
blackguards, whose only interest was, perhaps,
the value of a pot of beer depending
on the result, and who were proportionately
anxious to win, tie, or wrangle rather than
lose their valuable (?) investments. After
some time the ring-keepers succeeded in
clearing these gentry away, and inducing
Macdonald and Massey to return to their
duty; and the referee having said “Fight
on,” the battle proceeded.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, to whom the delay had
afforded a short respite, dashed in, caught
Sayers on the cheek, closed, and both fell.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers feinted, and got on to Tom’s
nozzle, drawing more claret, and, in getting
away from a rush, crossed his legs near the
stakes and fell.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, who was evidently fast
getting worn out, at the instigation of his
seconds dashed in, as if to make a final effort
to turn the scale; he let go both hands, but
was short, and Sayers once more pinked him
on the swollen smeller. Paddock still persevered,
and more exchanges, but not of a
severe description, took place, followed by
a breakaway and a pause. Again did they
get at it, and some heavy counter-hitting
took place; Sayers well on the mouth and
nose, and Paddock on the brow and forehead.
Paddock then rushed in and bored Sayers
down at the ropes. (Another claim of foul
disallowed.)</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock, desperate, rushed at once
to work; and they pegged away with a will,
but the punishment was all one way. At
last they closed and rolled over, Sayers
being top-sawyer. In the struggle and fall
the spikes in Sayers’s boot in some way
inflicted two severe wounds in Paddock’s
leg, and Massey declared that the injury
had been committed on purpose; but this
every one who saw the fight was convinced
was preposterous. Even supposing it was
Sayers’s spikes, it was evidently accidental,
but so clumsily did they roll over that it is
not impossible that it was done by the spikes
in the heel of Paddock’s other boot, which
spikes were much longer and sharper than
those of Sayers. The idea of Sayers doing
such a thing deliberately when he actually
had the battle in hand is too ridiculous to
admit of a question.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock rushed in and caught
Sayers on the side of the head with his
right, and they closed and pegged away at
close quarters until Sayers got down.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;The in-fighting in the last round had
told a tale on Paddock’s nob, which was
much swollen, and the left eye was now
beginning to follow suit with the right. At
last they got close, and both fell, Paddock
under. Massey made another claim that
Sayers fell with his knees on Paddock, but
it was evidently an attempt to snatch a
verdict.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock tried to make an expiring
effort, but was wofully short, and Sayers
countered heavily with the left on the damaged
cheek, then repeated the dose with
great severity, staggering the burly Tom,
who, however, soon collected himself, and
once more led off, but out of distance. He
then stood, until Sayers went to him, popped
a heavy one on the nose, and the
right on the cheek, then closed at the ropes,
where he fibbed Paddock very heavily, and
both fell, Paddock under.</p>

<p>     21 and last.&mdash;&#8203;Paddock came very slowly
to the scratch, evidently without the ghost
of a shadow of a chance. He was groggy,
and could scarcely see; the close quarters
in the last round had done their work, and
any odds might have been had on Sayers.
Paddock tried a rush, but, of course,
Sayers was nowhere near him, and as he
came again Sayers met him full on the right
cheek, a very heavy hit with his left. It
staggered poor Tom, who was evidently all
abroad, and all but fell. He put out his
hands, as if to catch hold of Sayers to support
himself, and the latter, who had drawn
back his right hand to deliver the coup de
grace, seeing how matters stood, at once
restrained himself, and seizing Paddock’s
outstretched hand, shook it warmly, and conducted
him to his corner, where his seconds,
seeing it was all over, at once threw up the
sponge, and Sayers was proclaimed the victor
in one hour and twenty minutes. Paddock
was much exhausted, and it was some
time before he was sufficiently himself to
realise the fact that he had been defeated,
when he shed bitter tears of mortification.
That he had any cause for grief beyond the
fact that he was defeated no one could say;
indeed if ever man persevered against nature
to make a turn it was he, for notwithstanding
the constant severe props he got whenever
he attempted to lead, he tried it on again
and again, and, to his praise be it said, took
his gruel with a good temper exceeding
anything we have ever witnessed on his
behalf during the whole of his career. As
soon as possible after the event was over,
the men were dressed and conveyed on board
the vessel, where Paddock received every
<a name="Page_406" id="Page_406"></a><span class="pageno">406</span>
attention his state required; but it was
long before he recovered from the mortification
he felt at his unexpected defeat. Sayers
in the meantime went round among the
spectators, and made a collection for him
amounting to £30.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Although the above battle
tells its own tale, our account would not be
complete unless we appended a few remarks,
not only upon the contest itself, but also on
the general management and other concomitants.
From the very commencement
it was obvious to us that the fight was
out of Tom Paddock. All the devil and determination
for which he had been so famous
had completely left him, and he was almost
as slow and ineffective as the old Tipton.
True, he left no stone unturned, and never
once flinched from the severity of the punishment
administered to him. He took all that
Sayers gave with apparent indifference, and
although it was obvious his powers of delivering
had departed, his extraordinary
gifts as a receiver of punishment were fully
equal to his olden reputation; and, as we
have before remarked, his good temper exceeded
anything we have ever witnessed on
his part. It was supposed by many that
had he not injured his right hand by the
blow delivered upon the stake he would
have done better; but, as he used that
mauley afterwards so effectually as to floor
the Champion, and as he admitted to us that
he felt his cause to be hopeless previous to
that accident, such speculations go for
nought. That both his daddles eventually
became much swollen and innocuous is true,
but that he could have turned the tide in his
favour had this not have been the case, we
do not believe. It was not the mere hardness
of the hammer that was wanting, but
the steam for driving the hammer was
absent. The principal cause of regret was
that he should have been induced, after his
severe illness, to try conclusions with one
so much fresher, and, as it turned out,
stronger than himself; but, however
much his physical powers had declined, it
was all along evident that his old spirit of
daring everything was as strong in him as
ever. From the first moment he entered
the ring he did all, and more than all, that
could be required of him to make a turn in
his favour, but in vain. As may be gathered
from our account, he once or twice seemed
to gain a slight advantage, but it was very
short lived. Enough, however, was done
by him to convince us that had he been the
Paddock of five years ago, the chance of
Tom Sayers retaining his proud position
would have been anything but “rosy.”
The collection made for Paddock proved the
estimation in which his gallantry was held
by the spectators.</p>

<p>     Sayers, throughout the contest, fought
with that extraordinary judgment of time
and distance which so much distinguished
him during the last few years of his career;
and from the first it was apparent that any
diffidence he might have displayed in his
mill with the Slasher had completely disappeared.
He abstained, to a considerable
extent, from the harlequinade which he displayed
in that encounter, and often stood
and fought with his ponderous opponent
with steadiness and precision. He fell
down, it is true, three times, but only on one
of these occasions could it be fairly said
that it was not accidental, and even then we
do not believe that it was a wilful act, especially
as it was clear that the tumbling
system was farthest from his thoughts, and
his great desire was to keep Paddock on his
legs.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Tom had now reached the very pinnacle of his fame, for among the
not very extensive range of big ones then in the field&mdash;&#8203;Harry Poulson,
Aaron Jones, the Tipton Slasher, and Tom Paddock had fallen beneath
his punishing arm, while Harry Broome, having struck his flag to Tom
Paddock, and Harry Orme (who had also retired) surrendered to Harry
Broome&mdash;&#8203;there was a clear title made for the Little Wonder, Tom Sayers,
the first ten-stone Champion.</p>

<p>This state of things seemed likely to leave Tom to enjoy <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">in otium cum
dignitate</span> the laurels of his many hard-fought days. The year 1858 grew
old, when once more “an Unknown” was talked of, who would be backed
to try conclusions for the £400 and belt against the redoubted Tom.
Again these rumours came from the head-quarters of the erewhile Champion,
Harry Broome, in the Haymarket; and to the astonishment of every
one who recollected the “lame and impotent conclusion” which, sixteen
<a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a><span class="pageno">407</span>
months before, marked what was supposed to be the first and last appearance
within any ring of Mr. Bill Bainge (Benjamin), that worthy was
named as the man for the coming fight.</p>

<p>It was urged by himself and his friends that he did not have fair play
in his training for his former battle; that he was very far from well on the day
of fighting; that these drawbacks, coupled with his novelty of his position
in entering the ring for the first time, and going through the ceremony of
peeling, <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> before the assembled throng, had quite unnerved him, and
rendered him almost oblivious as to what had actually taken place. The
weather, too (it was January, and bitterly cold), had a great effect on
him, his frame not being accustomed to the exposure in a “state of buff;”
and besides all this, he himself asserted that the suddenness and severity
of the punishment he received was something that had more paralysed
than hurt him. He had felt ever since that a stigma attached to his name,
which he felt conscious was not deserved. He believed himself at heart to be
no coward, and, being anxious to vindicate himself, he had begged his
backer to give him an opportunity of clearing his character, and that
gentleman, believing his version of the case to be true, had kindly granted
him a new trial. Of course, when Sayers heard of the challenge he was
nothing loth, feeling, as he did, certain of victory, while further calculating
that what he considered such an easy job would bring him six months
nearer to the retention of the belt as his own private property, he threw
not the slightest difficulty in the way of settling preliminaries, and articles
were signed and delivered at once.</p>

<p>The men did not go into training immediately, as they had nearly six
months before them, but Benjamin took every opportunity of gaining such
knowledge as might assist him in his undertaking, and acting under the
advice of an experienced ring-goer, he lost no time in securing the services of
“ould Nat Langham,” whose judgment could not but prove of the
greatest assistance. Liberal offers were made to Nat to go down to Shirenewton,
where Benjamin was resident, to take the entire management of
him, but Nat rightly judged that his own business was such as to require his
presence; he, therefore, contented himself with an occasional run down for
a couple of days, when he enforced upon his pupil some of his own peculiar
style of practice in many a heavy bout with the mufflers. As he could not
undertake the whole training, however, Nat recommended Bill’s backer to
send a retaining fee to the bold Bendigo, whose country habits, sobriety,
vigilance, and judgment he knew could be depended upon, and the appearance
<a name="Page_408" id="Page_408"></a><span class="pageno">408</span>
of his <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span> on the day of battle proved that his confidence had
not been misplaced, for his whole bearing was the very perfection of condition.
Bendy, however, had a corporation of most Daniel Lambert-like
proportions, no doubt much increased by good living, in which he had
indulged while superintending his new pupil, and was therefore a curious
choice for the trainer to a candidate for the championship.</p>

<p>As to the gallant Tom, he occupied the next four months after the
articles were signed in starring it about the country, and exhibiting himself,
his cups and his belts, to hosts of admiring friends. He took a benefit
here, a benefit there, and a couple of benefits in one week somewhere else,
and so on, and was everywhere so well received, that he must have returned
to town, prior to his going into work, with a perfect sack full of “shiners.”
He further announced at these gatherings his retirement from the Ring,
which he had already fixed for June, 1860, when the belt would become
his private property.</p>

<p>From the very first Tom held this match extremely light, and had
expressed the most entire confidence, a confidence which at one time during
the fight now under description we thought was very near proving his
downfall, from the fact of his having split on the same rock which has
proved fatal to many a good man and true under similar circumstances.
We allude to neglect of training. The first portion of Tom’s exercise,
which did not extend over more than seven weeks, was taken, as on former
occasions, in the neighbourhood of Tunbridge Wells, but about a month
later he removed to Rottingdean, another favourite locality of his, for the
purpose of sea bathing, and it was during his stay at this place that his
practices were anything but conducive to high condition. During his so-called
training, Tom, instead of the usual walking, running, <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> was
repeatedly seen on horseback in full career after the harriers which
meet in the neighbourhood, and during these gallops his falls were anything
but few and far between. Had the champion, by an unlucky purl, dislocated
a limb or sprained an ankle or a wrist, what a pretty pickle his
backers would have been in, and how he would have cursed his own folly!
His backers’ money would have been thrown away, his belt would have
been forfeited, and he would have had to recommence his career of three
years as its holder, in addition to losing the confidence of those who were
behind him. As it was, on entering the ring, the general remark was that
he was too fleshy, and there were signs of a protuberance in the neighbourhood
of his bread-basket which told an unmistakable tale. Many a
<a name="Page_409" id="Page_409"></a><span class="pageno">409</span>
brave fellow has suffered severely for this reckless despising of an adversary,
and has thereby lost a position which he has never been able to regain.</p>

<p>The rumours and speculations anent this match were of the most extraordinary
character. Tales of deep-laid conspiracies to rob the public&mdash;&#8203;such
as it has never been our ill fortune to see put into practice during our
career as chroniclers of this truly British sport&mdash;&#8203;were rife. The croakers
and slanderers, who always look at the dark side of the picture, and by
listening to the statements of those who attempt to decry the ring by blackening
the characters of its members, are always ready to see “a barney” in
every match, could not be persuaded to believe that Tom Sayers had far
too high a notion of himself to listen to any suggestions on such a subject;
and that, even admitting, for the sake of argument, that his principles
might give way (which we were confident they would not), his pride and
vanity were such as to forbid the supposition. While on the subject of
“barneys” we may be permitted to remark, that such occurrences are much
more common in the imaginations of some would-be knowing ones, who are
literally know-nothings, than in the actual practice of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>; and that
we firmly believe, and we state it earnestly and seriously, that there is far
less of this kind of thing in the doings of the members of the Prize Ring
than in almost any other sport. Besides these rumours about “Mr.
Barney,” there were whisperings that Benjamin was in reality an extraordinary
good man, and that the winning of the former fight by Sayers
was purely a piece of accidental good fortune. How these various “shaves”
were received by the general public and by the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognoscenti</span> may be best
gathered from the fact that as the day approached no one would take less
than 4 to 1 about Benjamin winning, and that many persons laid 5 to 2
that Sayers would win in a quarter of an hour. The betting on the whole,
however, was small in amount, the cause no doubt being the preposterous
odds demanded, which, as the backers of Sayers said, was actually buying
money.</p>

<p>Shortly after eleven o’clock Tom Sayers modestly dropped his castor over
the ropes, and then as modestly crept under them himself. He was
attended by Jerry Noon and Harry Brunton, and was received with enthusiastic
cheers. He had wisely donned his milling boots and drawers, and
had therefore only to remove his outer shell. After an interval of five
minutes he was followed by Benjamin, who made his <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</span> in an equally
unpretending way. He also was well received. He was waited on by the
Bold Bendigo and Jack Macdonald. At this time there were several
<a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"></a><span class="pageno">410</span>
offers to bet £20 to £5 on Sayers, but there were no takers. Despatch
being the order of the day, no time was lost by the men in preparing for
action. Benjamin, like Sayers, had taken the precaution to make ready
beforehand, so that a very few minutes sufficed to strip and tie the colours
in their appropriate places. Sayers sported a pink and white striped
brocaded silk of the richest description, while Benjamin adhered to the old-fashioned
blue and white spot. By twenty-three minutes past eleven
o’clock, under a burning sun, the men were delivered at the scratch and
stood ready for hostilities amidst the most profound silence. Benjamin
appeared in perfect health and condition; he had a smile of confidence on
his mug, and he stood well up in a fearless manner, presenting a wide contrast
to his <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</span> on the former occasion. He stood well over Sayers,
whose height is only 5 feet 8½ inches, and struck us as decidedly the more
powerful man. Although Tom was evidently too fleshy, there was a dash
and calm self-possession about him which denoted the more accustomed
boxer. He moved about in a business-like way, and evidently had no fears
for the result.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Benjamin stood well on the defensive,
and there was much in his position to
remind us of his mentor, Nat Langham. He
fixed his eye on Tom, and sparred for a
short time to see what could be done. His
whole bearing, indeed, was such as to call
forth a general remark that he was a
different man. Tom dodged in and out
in his usual style, evidently trying for
his favourite double, but Benjamin was
ready. At length Tom dashed in, and delivered
his left on the cheek, but was beautifully
countered on the smelling bottle, and
Benjamin had the honour of gaining “first
blood” from that organ, a success which
was hailed with much cheering from the
Taffies. Sayers seemed pricked at this, and
making his favourite dodge, he popped the
left on the body and then on the left cheek,
knocking Benjamin off his pins, thus gaining
the second event, and equalizing
matters.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Benjamin, nothing daunted, came
steadily to the scratch, and, after a feint,
let go his left, which was well stopped. He
got away from the return, and after some
sparring got home the left on the chest, and
they got to close quarters, when the in-fighting
was of a heavy description. Each
got pepper on the nozzle and whistler, and
Sayers also planted heavily on the side of
Bill’s nob. In the close at the ropes Benjamin
was forced down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Both came up a good deal flushed, and
each seemed blowing. Benjamin looked
serious, and was rather cautious. Sayers,
anxious to be at work, dashed in, and got
home a very straight one on the proboscis,
but Benjamin with great quickness countered
him on the left cheek, just under the
eye. This led to desperate exchanges, in
which there appeared to be no best. At
length Sayers caught his man round the
neck, and holding him tight, pegged away
with a will on his dial, and finally threw
him heavily, his nob coming with some
force against the stake.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Benjamin, desperate, at once rushed
to work, and after some tremendous exchanges,
each getting it on the left eye,
Benjamin fell.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers tried to lead off, but Benjy
walked away, in obedience to his seconds.
Sayers followed until they got close together,
and a magnificent rally followed, in which
Sayers drew the claret from Bill’s right
brow, and also paid a heavy visit to the
conk. Bill got on Tom’s left cheek, but
his blows had not the precision and weight
visible on the part of Sayers.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Benjamin was evidently shaken by the
punishment he had received, which even at
this early period was very severe. He sparred,
and was evidently in no hurry. Sayers
seeing this went to him, but was exceedingly
wild in his deliveries. At last he got home
on the bread-basket, but without effect, and
Benjamin missed his return. Tom now
<a name="Page_411" id="Page_411"></a><span class="pageno">411</span>
feinted, and just reached Bill’s smeller, but
it was a mere flyblow. He tried a body
blow, and was well countered on the cheek
and mouth. A close and in-fighting followed,
in which both were very wild, but in which
Tom again turned on the main from Benjamin’s
nose. After a struggle both fell
through the ropes.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Benjamin looked savage. He lost no
time in dashing at his man, and a tremendous
round followed. Sayers let go the
left at the nose, but Benjy countered him
straight and well with the same hand, opening
a fresh bottle. Several tremendous
counters with the left followed, Benjamin
astonishing every one by his calmness,
and by the precision with which he timed
his hits. Each got pepper on the nose and
eyes, and Sayers napped a nasty one on the
middle of the forehead. Sayers now missed
his left, and Bill returned well on the cheek.
They broke away, and after surveying one
another again went to it, and more heavy
exchanges took place, in which Tom again
turned on the main from Bill’s nasal fountain.
Benjamin persevered, and again did
they dispute the ground inch by inch. Both
were blowing, and the confidence of Bill’s
friends was looking up. It was plain both
men meant to do all they knew in this bout,
and that each felt that it was to be the turning
point, one way or the other. Sayers now got
heavily on the left eye, which began to close,
while Bill caught him on the mouth. The
fighting was tremendous, and the way Benjamin
stood to his man was beyond all praise.
Sayers now and then was extremely wild,
and had Benjamin possessed more knowledge
of the art the result might have been
serious, for Tom was evidently tiring fast,
but still the greater force of his hitting was
evidently telling a tale. As hit succeeded
hit Bill’s dial grew more slantindicular; but
he was undaunted, and evidently had made
up his mind to do or die. At length they
got to close quarters, when some heavy
fibbing took place, and both fell, Benjamin
under.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Bill’s left eye was all but closed, the
bump at the side telling of Tom’s powers of
delivery. Sayers was much flushed, and
puffing like a grampus; he lost no time,
however, in going to work, evidently hoping
to frighten his man. Benjamin was ready,
and after some sharp exchanges in his
favour, he retreated. Tom followed, and as
Benjamin attempted to plant his left, Tom
cross-countered him heavily with his right
on the jaw, and knocked him off his pins.
He was almost out of time, and it required
all the exertions of his seconds to get him
round.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Benjamin shook himself, and came up
resolutely, but evidently much shaken. He
sparred a little, and on Tom going in, he
timed him neatly on the middle of the dial,
but without much force. Again did Sayers
try it with a like result, and Benjamin
then dashed in, but was short. Sayers returned
with great quickness on the bad eye,
and poor Benjamin was again floored.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Benjamin struggled up gamely,
although requested to give in; he held up
his hands, and tried to counter with his man,
but Tom with great neatness got well home
on the good eye, avoiding the return, and
Benjamin once more dropped. His seconds
threw up the sponge, but the poor fellow
broke from them, with an intimation that he
was not licked, and wanted to prove he was
no cur, and commenced.</p>

<p>     11th and last.&mdash;&#8203;Benjamin tried to lead off,
but it was evidently a mere flash in the
pan; he missed and stumbled forward, when
Tom gave him a slight tap on the nose,
which sent him for the last time to grass.
He was conveyed to his corner, and his
seconds then declared he should fight no
longer. Sayers went to him to shake hands,
but Benjamin, who was all but blind, wished
to commence another round. This, of
course, could not be listened to, and the
poor fellow was forced from the ring against
his will, Sayers being proclaimed the winner
in twenty-two minutes, amidst the enthusiastic
cheers of his friends. Benjamin was
much exhausted, and his punishment was
as heavy as one generally sees in double
the time. He took it, however, unflinchingly,
never complaining from first to last;
and on this occasion, although defeated, his
most determined enemy (if he has one) cannot
say he was dishonoured. Sayers also
was much exhausted, but this arose not so
much from his punishment, although in this
respect he did not come off scatheless, as
from his want of condition telling upon
him in a battle which was disputed for some
rounds with unwonted quickness and desperation.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Having commented upon the
want of condition of Tom Sayers, and having
gone at some length into a description
of this short but busy fight, it is unnecessary
to trouble our readers with many
remarks thereupon. That Benjamin succeeded
in redeeming his character, and
proving that he can receive punishment and
struggle hard for victory when properly
looked after, is not for a moment to be
denied, but that he will ever make a star
in the pugilistic horizon we do not for a
moment believe. He is, at 34, too old to
learn the rudiments of the business; at that
age even the limbs of a practised boxer
begin to get stiff, and it is therefore extremely
improbable that those of a man
trained to other pursuits can acquire that
quickness and readiness so necessary to a
finished pugilist. Had he begun some
years ago, we think it not improbable, with
such strength and activity as he possesses,
he might have hoped to rank in the first
division. The desperation with which he
contested the seventh round&mdash;&#8203;which was
one of the sharpest and severest we ever
<a name="Page_412" id="Page_412"></a><span class="pageno">412</span>
saw&mdash;&#8203;evidently showed what he might have
done; but as it is we think, having fulfilled
his mission and proved to his friends that
he is composed of more sterling metal than
they gave him credit for, the best advice we
can give him is to shun for the future the
attractions of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, and devote himself
to the duties of his station in his own
country. We are glad for his own credit
sake that he determined to undergo this
second ordeal, and equally glad that he
came out of it so successfully. It also gives
us pleasure to know that he has good and
staunch friends at his back, who having
witnessed his performance on Tuesday, are
perfectly satisfied with him. Of Tom
Sayers we have only to say that he did not
fight so well on this as on former occasions;
and, as we think this was entirely owing to
want of condition, we feel we are only doing
him a favour in impressing upon him the
necessity in future of leaving no stone
unturned to retain that confidence which
has been hitherto so implicitly placed in
him.</p>

<p>Thus ended the second attempt of the Broomes (Harry and Frederick)
to wrest the belt from the great little Champion, but there were other
“Richmonds” now in the field. Bob Brettle, of Birmingham, could not
persuade himself that he was unable to interpose a check to the victorious
career of the hardy Tom. Bob had his own reasons, too, for
believing in his chance. He had tried conclusions with the Champion
with the gloves, and felt assured he had the best of it; and in this, perhaps,
he was not far wrong, for it was pretty generally known that Tom was
much more at home with his digits in nature’s habiliments, and in a four-and-twenty-feet
ring, than when they were muffled in horsehair in the
sparring-school. The backers of Tom at first laughed at Bob’s propositions,
but he declared he was in earnest, and went so far as to say they
would wish they had let him alone before they had done with him. After
much palaver Sayers offered to stake £400 to £200, but Brettle then
required the belt to be thrown in. This, of course, was rejected, Tom considering
that as holder of that trophy he was only bound to defend it on
even terms. Brettle was extremely loth to give up his chance for the
belt, but still he did not think it equivalent to the extra £200 which
Sayers had offered to stake, and eventually he waived all pretensions to
the “ornamental,” and closed the bargain on the chance of obtaining the
“useful,” which would have sufficed to purchase a belt of double the
mere intrinsic value.</p>

<p>At the meeting at Owen Swift’s, where the articles were finally ratified,
a friend of the Champion’s treated the match with such ridicule
that he ventured to suggest the probability of Bob being licked in <em>ten
minutes</em>, whereupon Brettle, in the heat of the moment, offered to bet £100
to £10 against such a contingency. “Make it £200 to £20,” said Tom’s
friend, “and it’s a bet.” “Done,” said Bob, and the money was staked
in the hands of Alec Keene. All these preliminaries were adjusted before
the second fight for the Championship in April between Tom Sayers and
<a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"></a><span class="pageno">413</span>
Bill Benjamin, it being stipulated that Tom should name a day after that
event was decided.</p>

<p>At Tattersall’s, on the previous Monday, September 18th, the event
seemed to attract as much attention as the speculations on either of the
great handicaps, and in the yard a regular ring was formed, where betting,
or offers to bet, went on very briskly. The backers of Tom commenced
by offering 5 to 2, at which some few investments were made, but the
Brums soon opened their mouths for longer odds, and would take no less
than 3 to 1, and at this price again money was laid until the Sayersites in
their turn held back, and speculation left off at offers of 5 to 2. In the
evening, at the sporting houses, 3 to 1 might have been got in some few
instances, and a sanguine admirer of Tom’s actually laid 4 to 1, but we
believe he was a solitary specimen.</p>

<p>For at least a month, Mr. John Gideon, one of the most earnest backers
of Sayers, had been on the look-out for a scene of action which might be
reached with ease and comfort, and which, at the same time, should be so
situated as to be beyond the reach of the rough and ready attendants at
boxing matches, whose presence is anything but desirable, and also tolerably
safe from the too-prying eyes of the powers that be, who do not love a
mill, and who will in the most unaccountable manner interfere with the
pleasures of the Fancy, on the ground that a friendly boxing-match is a
breach of the peace. A few consultations with other managers of excursions,
and a considerable expenditure of time and trouble, ended in the
perfect success of Mr. Gideon’s arrangements, and not only did he carry
the expedition to a triumphant <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</span>, but ensured the utmost comfort
to all the travellers. Of course the profits of the expedition were equally
divided between the backers of both men, and the figure being tolerably
high, and the company unusually numerous, there is no doubt each realised
a handsome sum. Owing to the distance to be travelled, a very early start
was found absolutely necessary, and seven o’clock being the hour named,
the “lads wot loves a mill” had to be early afoot; and many there were
who having, as usual, devoted the first two or three hours of the morning
of the 20th of September to “seeing life,” found some difficulty in opening
their eyes in their very first sleep to enable them to get to the starting-post
in time. Many a one started breakfastless, and many were the wistful
glances cast at the victualling department under the able charge of
Mr. Dan Pinkstone, an old and well-known caterer, long before the end of
the journey was attained; but as the train could not be stopped there was
<a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"></a><span class="pageno">414</span>
of course no chance of an issue of stores from the commissariat until the
goal was reached&mdash;&#8203;a field near Ashford, in Kent, being the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">champ clos</span> for
combat.</p>

<p>The train comprised thirty-six carriages, every one of which had at
least its full complement of travellers, and many were over-full. The start
was effected by a quarter before eight, and with the aid of two powerful
engines a rapid and pleasant journey was effected to the scene of action,
on entirely maiden ground, some sixty miles from the Metropolis, which
was reached shortly after ten o’clock. The vast multitude lost no time in
clearing out from the carriages, and a pioneer, who had gone on ahead
the previous evening, placing himself at the head of the army, proceeded,
closely followed by the veteran Commissary and his <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse comitatus</span>, to the
proposed scene of action. No time was cut to waste in preparing the lists,
which were in readiness before eleven o’clock. While these preliminaries
were being arranged, a brisk business was carried on in the sale of inner
ring tickets, and our readers may judge of the class of spectators and their
number when we tell them that the sale realised a sum of £54 10s. for the
benefit of the P.B.A. This done, Billy Duncan and his constables proceeded
to clear out the ring, and experienced the usual difficulty in persuading
the company to seat themselves at a sufficient distance from the
enclosure. All were naturally anxious to be as close as possible, and
accordingly had seated themselves in compact rows, those in front close to
the ropes. The consequence was, that all were crowded together, and
many were scarcely able to get a glimpse of the ring. And now as we
have brought the men <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en face</span>, we will say a few words concerning Tom’s
antagonist, as we do not purpose to devote space to him in a separate
Memoir.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bob Brettle</span> was born at Portobello, near Edinburgh, in January,
1832, and was therefore, six years younger than Tom Sayers. On the
present occasion he just turned the scale at 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, and did not appear
in any way too fleshy. By calling he was a glassblower, and it was while
he was engaged in one of the larger establishments in the hardware districts
that he first became connected with the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> His first essay of
which we have any record was with Malpas, of Birmingham, whom he
fought for £50 a side, on the 14th of February, 1854. There were 80
rounds, principally in favour of Bob, but eventually there was a claim of
foul on his part. A wrangle took place; the referee gave two decisions,
and ultimately the stakes were drawn. Brettle’s next encounter was with
<a name="Page_415" id="Page_415"></a><span class="pageno">415</span>
old Jack Jones of Portsmouth, for £100 a side, on the 21st of November,
1854. Jack had only been out of the hospital a few weeks, and was in
anything but condition; but still he had the best of the mill, Brettle
resorting to the dropping system. Forty-nine rounds were fought in 105
minutes, when darkness came on, and as neither man was much punished,
the referee ordered them to fight again on the following Saturday. On
that day Jones was at the appointed place, but Brettle did not show, and
it being discovered subsequently that he had been apprehended, either
through the kind offices of his friends or by his own negligence, the stakes
were awarded to Jones. After this Bob was idle until the 20th of
November, 1855, when he defeated Roger Coyne, of Birmingham, for £25
a side, in 49 rounds and 48 minutes. Then came his match with Sam
Simmonds, for £200 a side, which took place near Didcot, June 3rd, 1856,
and was won by Bob very easily in 13 rounds and 16 minutes.</p>

<p>Another year, or rather more, elapsed before Bob made another essay,
his next opponent being Job Cobley, dubbed by his patron Baron (Renton)
Nicholson, “the Enthusiastic Potboy,” whom he fought for £100 a side,
August 4th, 1857. Here Bob’s greater weight and superior strength
enabled him to take a decided lead, and Job, finding it too hot to be
pleasant, resorted to dropping, and finally lost the battle by falling without
a blow in the 47th round, at the expiration of 90 minutes.</p>

<p>On the 25th of January following, Brettle met Bob Travers for £100 a
side at Appledore, when, after fighting 42 rounds in 65 minutes, the police
interfered. An adjournment took place to the following day, when they
met again at Shell Haven, and after fighting 100 rounds in 2 hours and 5
minutes, Bob Travers, who had, like “the Enthusiastic Potboy,” found the
earth the safest place, was decided to have lost the battle by falling without
a blow.</p>

<p>Bob’s only subsequent encounter was with Jem Mace of Norwich, who,
as may be seen in our next chapter, met him, for £100 a side, on the 21st of
September, 1858, and at the end of two rounds and three minutes, although
with none the worst of it, hid his diminished head, and declined to have any
more. This was Bob’s last appearance prior to the present, and it was imagined
by most people that he would retire from the Ring, but the temptation of
a turn at the Champion was too great for him, and induced him to try a
flight at the top of the tree. It is difficult to understand whence he got the
confidence to match himself against Sayers, unless it was from his supposed
superiority with the gloves&mdash;&#8203;in the case of Tom Sayers an unusually
<a name="Page_416" id="Page_416"></a><span class="pageno">416</span>
delusive test. This brings us to the eventful 20th of September, 1858, and
the ring at Ashford.</p>

<p>So soon as all were seated a cap was seen to fly over the heads of the
dense mass, and in a second Bob Brettle, aided by his seconds, Alec
Keene and Jem Hodgkiss, of Birmingham, was seen elbowing his way
through the crowd. He was vociferously cheered on all hands, and his
good-humoured mug brightened up with a broad grin of delight at the
hearty welcome. Tom Sayers was not long behind him, and as he entered
on the scene, attended by Jack Macdonald and Harry Brunton, he too was
greeted with a tremendous ovation, which he acknowledged in a becoming
manner, and then shook hands good-humouredly with his opponent. The
spectators now began to make their final investments, and several bets of
3 to 1 were made and staked to considerable amounts. The last, however,
that we heard was £25 to £10 on Sayers. After the lads had completed
their toilettes Brettle came forward and offered to take £150 to £50 from
Tom, but the Champion declined, as his money was all on. Bob then
held up the note and offered to take the same odds from any spectator, but
silence was the only reply, and he had to return the flimsy to his “cly.”
Tom’s colour was a very handsome blue and white stripe, with blue border;
and Bob’s a dark blue, with a white star. Brettle’s boots having been examined
by Tom’s seconds, it was found that the spikes were beyond the
regulation length, and had to be filed, but this was so inefficiently done
that they were still far too sharp and long for the purpose for which they were
intended. Had Sayers’s seconds done their duty resolutely they would have
shown them to the referee, who doubtless would have ordered a still further
curtailment, but Tom personally requested them to make no bother about
it, as, in his own words, he “could give all that in.”</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On throwing off their blankets
there was a great disparity in the appearance
of the men, much greater, indeed, than
would have been expected from the slight
difference in weight. Tom, whose condition
was superb, was broad-shouldered, thick-loined,
and muscular, the weight being just
where it ought to be; while Brettle looked
narrow and round on the shoulders, and had
not the upright, firm bearing of the Champion.
In height, too, there appeared more
than the actual difference of a bare inch.
Tom’s mug, of the two, was fleshier than his
opponent’s, but it looked hard as nails. In
point of age it was evident there was a considerable
difference in favour of the Brum,
whose fresh, fair skin and healthful country
appearance contrasted strongly with the
Champion’s bronzed but somewhat stale
complexion. The wear and tear of fifteen
contests, and the gay life he had led, had
evidently left their mark. Each had a pleasant,
good-humoured smile on his phiz, but
the Champion seemed to be more at home
than his adversary. Bob looked cunning
and shifty, walking round his man with a
kind of crab-like, sideway movement, and
leering out of the corner of his eye, evidently
on the look-out to catch the Champion tripping,
and make a dash at him with his right.
Tom was awake, however, and though not
moving far from the scratch, stepped with
<a name="Page_417" id="Page_417"></a><span class="pageno">417</span>
his adversary, and contrived to keep continually
facing him. At length Bob, finding
his man so “fly” to his “little game,”
dashed straight at him, and let go the left,
which caught Tom very slightly on the nose.
Tom nodded and smiled as much as to say,
“Wait a minute;” and Bob renewed his
journey round his man, who remained in
the middle of the ring. At length Brettle
again dashed in, and exchanges took place,
in which Tom left his mark on Bob’s forehead,
the bump being of considerable size.
Brettle retreated, came again, and lunging
out his left was prettily countered on the
mouth, from which “first blood” was instantly
visible, the blow being a hot ’un.
Some neat exchanges followed on the side of
the head; they then broke away, and, as
Sayers followed his man, Bob ducked his
head, but Sayers caught him a sharp spank
on the proboscis, which led to counter-hitting,
when Tom got well on the forehead, and
Bob fell. A claim of first knock-down for
Tom was made but disallowed, as Bob was
evidently getting down when the blow
reached him.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Bob’s nose and mouth showed that
Tom had been there; he, however, dashed
in, and heavy exchanges took place, Tom
getting on to the left peeper and Brettle the
body. Brettle now broke away, and resorted
to his cunning peripatetic dodge, but
Tom only grinned, turned as he moved, and
waited for him. At length Bob dashed
in, and got on the chest very slightly,
Sayers returning well on the kisser.
Brettle, after another pedestrian excursion,
came again and let go the left,
which was stopped, and he again “walked
round and showed his muscle.” Tom stepped
with him, and each tried to draw the other,
until Brettle at last let go his left, and
sharp exchanges followed on the cheek with
the left, and Sayers fell. A claim of knockdown
for Brettle not allowed, Tom being
on the hop, and partially slipping down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers, on owning up, had a slight
mark on the left cheek, which caused the
Brums to cheer vociferously. Brettle, seeing
it, made a dash to force the fighting, but
Tom stopped him by a straight one on the
whistler, and then closed. This led to some
sharp but very wild in-fighting in Tom’s
corner, and at last Brettle was down on his
knees with all the worst of it.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;The Brum came up blinking with his
left eye, which had evidently got pepper in
the last wild rally, and seemed as if about
to close. It was now discovered that the ten
minutes had just expired, and that his bet
of £200 was saved. He lost no time in getting
to work, but giving one or two sideway
steps he dashed in, planted his right on the
ribs, and then one or two sharp counter-hits
were exchanged. While dodging and stepping
in and out, Brettle’s spikes came into
dangerous collision with Tom’s shin, and inflicted
a serious wound; Tom pointed to the
injured spot and shook his head, whereupon
Bob apologised, assured him that it was unintentional,
and promised to be more careful
for the future. The wound was excessively
deep, and only shows the extreme danger of
using such absurd spikes, which are utterly
useless to a man who intends really to keep
on his legs. Tom, after a little dodging, got
heavily on the nose, and counter-hits were
exchanged, Tom getting very heavily on the
left peeper, and receiving a hot one on the
jaw, which knocked him clean off his legs.
(“First knock down” for Brettle, who was
enthusiastically cheered as he went to his
corner.)</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;On coming up there was no mark of
Bob’s visitation on Tom’s jaw, but the effect
of Tom’s blows on Brettle’s mouth and eye
was very visible. His nose and left eye were
swollen, and the claret was still visible from
his mouth. (The backers of Tom offered 4
to 1, but in only one instance was it taken&mdash;&#8203;<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>,
by Bob Travers, who invested “a tenner”
on the Brummagem pet.) Brettle, after
a little queer manœuvring, rushed in left
and right, and got the latter on the body,
but not heavily. He looked serious, and
walked round and round, but finding Tom
ready he tried a dash, succeeding in landing
the right on the body. Tom got heavily on
the forehead, and then, counter-hits being
exchanged, Brettle got slightly on the neck,
and Tom, with his right, caught Brettle
very heavily on the left shoulder, and Bob
went down in Tom’s corner. Sayers ran
after Brettle as he was being carried to his
corner, with a curious look of anxiety and
alarm on his countenance, evidently thinking
that he had inflicted some dangerous injury.
Finding, however, that the blow had
not had the serious effect he feared, he walked
smiling to his corner.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Brettle came up looking very serious,
and several times led off left and right, but
quite out of distance. Tom then stepped
in and tried his left, which Brettle cleverly
avoided, and then returned on the chest.
They quickly got to close quarters, and after
a sharp exchange on the neck, Brettle fell
forward on his hands in Sayers’s corner, Tom
missing a terrific upper-cut with his right
as he fell.</p>

<p>7th and last.&mdash;&#8203;Brettle missed several well-intended
lunges with the right, and then
walked round the ring; he came again, and
tried the left with a similar result. He
kept hitting out of distance, as if afraid of
Tom’s right, which had already missed him
so narrowly. Again and again did he step
in and out, and as Sayers tried to catch him
on the hop he would point and grin; at last
he got slightly on the chest, receiving a
little one on the cheek. Brettle retreated,
and then hit out with his left most furiously,
but missed, and Tom countered him
heavily on the shoulder; Brettle immediately
<a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"></a><span class="pageno">418</span>
put his right hand to his shoulder
as if in pain; he, however, shook himself
together, and tried to stand and prop his
man with his right, but from the expression
of his countenance something evidently was
amiss, and on Tom’s approaching him he
got down in his own corner, apparently
suffering considerable pain. Solid Coates,
his umpire, at once went to his corner, and
on inquiry found that he had dislocated his
shoulder, either by the force of his own
blow, or from the effect of Tom’s heavy
counter; and this being the case, of course
he had no option but to resign the victory
to Tom Sayers, who was hailed the conqueror
in <em>fifteen minutes</em>. Tom at once
went to shake hands with his fallen foe, and
then resuming his clothes, quickly reappeared
among his friends without a mark to
show that he had been fighting. A medical
friend who was on the ground quickly
attended upon poor Brettle, and lost no
time in restoring his arm to its position,
and the poor fellow, more injured in mind
than body, was soon sufficiently recovered
to enter freely into conversation with his
friends, many of whom believed, and
still believe, that he had to the full as
good a chance as Tom Sayers at the time so
disastrous a termination to the battle
occurred. That this was so is, of course,
but a matter of opinion; our ideas on the
subject will be found in the remarks appended.
That Bob’s own opinion did
not coincide with that of his friends may be
gathered from the fact that he subsequently
called upon us to state his intention of
retiring from the ring. He says he knows
of no man of his weight who is likely to try
conclusions with him; that he has no intention
of again overmatching himself as on the
present occasion, and as he has a good business
in Birmingham, he thinks he can well
afford to leave fighting alone, at any rate as
an active professor of the art. In this
resolve we think he is perfectly right, and
as he is a thoroughly honest, upright young
fellow, and of an excellent temper, we do
not doubt of his success.</p>

<p>Before closing this part of our account we
should not be rendering justice where it is
due did we not mention that Jack Macdonald,
one of Tom Sayers’s seconds, on finding
the nature of Bob’s injuries, rushed to
his corner, and rendered very material
assistance to the surgeon in attendance in
restoring the dislocated arm to its socket.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Where the battle was of such
short duration, it is, of course, difficult to
find much to say in the shape of remarks.
To every judge of milling who was on the
ground, not excluding some of Brettle’s
own friends, it was obvious from the very
first round that, bar an accident, the victory
must lie with the favourite. In fact, in our
own hearing, at the conclusion of the first
round, where Tom drew the crimson from
Brettle’s mouth, and set his sign manual on
his forehead, one of the backers of the
latter said, “It’s all over; we shan’t win.”
It had been anticipated that the Champion,
in his anxiety to win the bet of £200 to £20,
would at once take the initiative, and that
thereby he would throw himself open to the
dangerous right-handed counters of Bob;
but those who knew Tom Sayers were too
well acquainted with his judgment and tact
to believe any such thing; hence their confidence
and the great odds they so freely
laid. From the very commencement it was
obvious Tom saw the game he had to play,
and the calm way in which he shifted his
position so as always to present a square
front to the enemy delighted every one.
He was, of course, taken by surprise at
Bob’s getting home first, but this only rendered
him steadier, and convinced him that
he must act in a cautious manner. We do
not believe he for a moment contemplated
going for the bet, although we feel convinced
that had one vicious upper-cut got
home he must have won it to the greatest
certainty. In all his recent fights he has
been the one that has fought in the jump-about,
dancing-master style, but here he
was the steady old stager, quietly biding his
time and seldom throwing away a hit. The
knock-down blow in the fourth round was indubitably
a fair knock-down, but it must not
be forgotten that although matters thereby
looked favourable for Brettle, the real fact
was that Tom in his counter got home much
heavier than his opponent, and that had he
been stepping in instead of back at the
moment he would not have been floored.
The proof of the effectiveness of the blow
was seen on the men again appearing at the
scratch, when Tom showed no mark, while
the evidence of his visitation to Bob’s eye
was unmistakable. That the battle terminated
as it did we cannot help feeling
was fortunate for Brettle. Tom’s
dangerous right&mdash;&#8203;never brought into play
until he has his man “safe,” as he says&mdash;&#8203;was
already busy; true, he missed once or twice,
but he is not the man to do this often, and
had it got home effectively there is no telling
what injury he might have inflicted. The
actual cause of Bob’s accident it is impossible
to fathom. Some aver that it was
partly caused by the heavy blow in the fifth
round, others that the shoulder was injured
by the fall on his hands, but, as he was able
to use it so vigorously in the last round,
we believe both these suppositions to be
wrong. Possibly they may have rendered
the muscles weaker than usual, and predisposed
the arm for such a <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contretemps</span>, but
our own idea is that Bob, swinging his arm
out so very viciously at a distance from his
man, and receiving a tap on the collar-bone
at the same moment, the joint was jerked
out entirely in that manner. That his arm
was dislocated there was not the slightest
doubt, for we have the evidence not only of
the surgeon himself, but also of Jack Macdonald,
as to the dislocation being reduced:
<a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a><span class="pageno">419</span>
and even if we had not, the expression of
poor Brettle’s countenance and his contortions
when in his corner were far too natural
to have been put on for the occasion. We
should not have thought it necessary to
make these observations had we not heard
it whispered that a set of idiots, who think
everything connected with the ring is
“a barney,” or something tantamount to it,
have been going about saying that there
was no accident at all, and that the statement
as to Brettle’s accident was all moonshine.
The gentry who make these remarks
should look at home, and before throwing
mud at persons in a different walk of
life, should consider whether in the
event of a similar compliment being paid to
themselves, there would not be a much larger
portion of the sticking part attached to
them, and whether they could be as
easily whitewashed as their humbler, though
perhaps, honester, brethren of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> Of
Brettle’s performances we need say but
little. He evidently found himself out-generalled
from the first; and this being the
case, all that remained for him to do was to
make the best of a bad bargain, and this we
are bound to say he did to the utmost of his
ability. Our own opinion was, before the
battle, that he had not the ghost of a chance,
and that opinion was borne out by the
result. We are sorry that he was disappointed
in his expectations, which were
entirely raised by his underrating his man;
but as we do not believe he will be a loser
by his defeat, he is, perhaps, not to be so
much pitied as some of his less fortunate
compeers. He has been always a general
favourite, and so long as he perseveres in
his present straightforward course he must
retain the good wishes of all parties. As
we have stated above, we think he has taken
a wise resolution in retiring from the Ring,
and we hope that no vain flattery on the
part of any interested admirers will induce
him to change his resolution.</p>

<p>These excellent remarks of the writer, on the readiness of silly persons
to impute dishonesty to the losing pugilist, are as laudable as they are just
and honest. We shall elsewhere have occasion to remark upon a recent
work devoted to the resuscitation and reassertion of these defunct, discreditable,
and often dishonest “shaves.”</p>

<p>With this very easy defeat of the Birmingham Pet, Tom Sayers, as was
generally supposed, had disposed of the last of his competitors for the belt;
but it was not to be so. A breeze, whispering of war, was heard from
across the broad Atlantic. Aaron Jones, not long after his defeat by Sayers,
had emigrated to the land of the stars and stripes, and being a fine-looking
young fellow, of good address, and of quiet and civil deportment, had found
much favour as a teacher of the art pugilistic among our Yankee cousins.
His anecdotes of British boxers and exemplifications of the English method
became fashionable among the young bloods of New York, and the subject
of pugilism grew to be the talk of the town. John Heenan had been selected
by a party to “whip” John Morrissey, who for some reason had become
obnoxious to some of them, and Heenan’s friends made choice of Aaron
Jones as trainer and ring adviser of “The Benicia Boy.” Heenan, however,
being attacked by illness, was stopped in his work, and thus forced to
go into the ring with a stone of superabundant flesh, and suffered defeat at
the hands of Morrissey. About the close of the year 1858, distance lending
enchantment to the view, the Transatlantic papers told us that Aaron
did not think Tom Sayers such a very formidable customer after all, and
“Had a mind to return and have a second (third?) shy for the belt.”
<a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a><span class="pageno">420</span>
Rumour added that, failing Aaron, Uncle Sam was about to send over one
of his champions, to see what he could do towards humbling the pride of
the little Englishman. Early in 1849 rumour ripened into certainty, and
a letter reached <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> office from Mr. Wilkes, inquiring on what terms
Heenan could be placed on the rota to have his turn against Sayers. A
good deal of astonishment was created at the time by the fact that the
defeated man, and not the winner of the American fight for the championship,
had been selected; but when it came to be remembered that Morrissey,
the winner, was an Irishman by birth, and not a native American,
the wonderment ceased, and Heenan was recognised as the proper representative
of America. The Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> replied to Mr. Wilkes’s
letter, intimating that immediately on the receipt of a deposit from Heenan he
could be placed on the list. He further stated, however, that, in the event
of his winning, he would not be permitted to take the belt back to America,
without leaving its equivalent in value or remaining here three years to
contest its possession against all comers on the usual terms. By the next
mail, after Mr. Wilkes’s first letter, came a second, dated New York,
March 29, 1859, which was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pneg flushright r4">“March 29, 1859.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;&#8203;Enclosed please find a draft for £200 sterling, drawn in your favour on
the Bank of Liverpool, which I have been requested to forward to you, on the part of Aaron
Jones, in order that you may deposit for him the necessary sum for a meeting with the
Champion of England within six months of the date of the battle of the 5th April, between
Sayers and Benjamin; and in case the winner of that fight do not accept, you will please
hold the money subject to my order. The language with which Jones accompanies this
draft is as follows:&mdash;&#8203;‘I, Aaron Jones, hereby challenge the winner of the coming fight for
the championship, to fight me in six months from that time for <em>two hundred pounds and the
Champion’s belt</em>. The fight to take place near London, and to be governed by the rules of
the London Prize Ring.’ Jones also requests me to say to you for him that ‘he would
prefer having the forfeit or first deposit to be as much as <em>fifty pounds</em>, as he does not wish to
be at the trouble of crossing the Atlantic for nothing, though he is willing to pay his own
expenses over and back to get the fight.’ He also hopes that Sayers will, for old acquaintance’
sake, give him the first chance; but this is a consideration which I have no right to
press, after having previously consented to lay before you the wishes or the claims of
Heenan. Your sense of propriety will find a law for the matter, and will, I hope, likewise
permit me to remain, yours, very truly at command,</p>

<p class="flushright">“GEO. WILKES.</p>

<p>“P.S.&mdash;&#8203;I am also desired by the backers of Jones to say that the stakes will be increased
to <em>five hundred pounds a side</em>, if the Champion wishes it.</p>

<p class="flushright">“G. W.”</p>
</div><!--end letter-->

<p>To this letter Sayers at once replied, closing with the proposition of
Jones, and thus placing that hero first on the list of candidates after his
second battle with Benjamin. Hardly had the missive of the gallant Tom
been despatched when another letter arrived from Mr. Wilkes&mdash;&#8203;who
throughout acted as the adviser and amanuensis of both Jones and Heenan&mdash;&#8203;enclosing
<a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"></a><span class="pageno">421</span>
a sum of £50, which he had been directed by his friends
to stake on the part of Heenan. In that letter he requested the
stakeholder, if not contrary to rule, to give Heenan’s claim the preference,
as that aspiring youth had been the first to challenge Sayers, and was
fearful that if he was not at once placed on the list of candidates, his
chance of encountering Sayers might be entirely lost by some unforeseen
accident. Inasmuch, however, as Jones, with prudent foresight, had
been the first to post the coal, the stakeholder felt bound, according to
practice, to give him the priority, and Heenan was compelled reluctantly
to moderate his impatience; Heenan, like Jones, offered, if Sayers wished,
to increase the stakes to £500 a side.</p>

<p>Shortly after the second defeat of Bill Benjamin, Tom Sayers was called
upon to meet Jack Macdonald, who had been delegated by Aaron Jones to
act the part of plenipotentiary on his behalf. Another conference was
held, and after many <em>pros</em> and <em>cons.</em>, articles were signed, sealed, and
delivered, under which Jones was bound to fight the Champion early in
the current year, a margin of one month being allowed on either side as to
the actual day of battle. For this match £50 a side was deposited. It
was not long after this that a further communication was received from
Mr. Wilkes, requesting the stakeholder to return him £50 out of the
£200 he had sent for Jones, to pay the passage of Aaron to Europe, and
to transfer the remaining £100 to the account of the match between
Heenan and Sayers. He added, that if Jones intended to go on with his
match he would have to find the remainder of his money himself, his
American friends having some reason to be dissatisfied with him, and
being desirous of transferring all their interest to the Benicia Boy. By
the very next mail came another letter intimating that Jones would be
able to find all his money himself, and therefore the match was still to be
considered “on,” and so for several months the matter rested.</p>

<p>In the following October the public were startled at reading the following
letter from Mr. Wilkes to the Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="flushright">“Office, <cite>Wilkes’s Spirit of the Times</cite>, New York, Oct. 7, 1859.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;&#8203;I take pleasure of informing you that Aaron Jones, conceding to the
common desire on this side of the Atlantic to see Heenan have the first chance at Sayers for
the Championship (after the Unknown), has desired me to have forfeited the £50 which now
remain staked for him in your hands against Sayers. Enclosed I send you Jones’s letter
authorising me to take this course; and as I represent the money of his backers, your
authority for declaring the match “off” will, I suppose, be considered complete. I forget,
as I write, whether Sayers has already covered a deposit of Heenan’s for the Championship;
if not, please let the same deposit be made and covered in his case (£50) as was made and
covered in the case of Aaron Jones. I am very solicitous about this point as, for special
reasons, I want Heenan regularly upon the record at as early a moment as possible. I send
<a name="Page_422" id="Page_422"></a><span class="pageno">422</span>
with this a note to Sayers, directed to your care, in which I apprise him of Jones’s forfeit.
Please preserve the note of Jones to me, and believe me to be yours, ever truly, at command,</p>

<p class="flushright">“GEO. WILKES, Editor <cite>Wilkes’s Spirit of the Times</cite>.”</p>
</div><!--end letter-->

<p>This communication was of course made known to Sayers without loss
of time, and having now no business on hand, the way was clear for the
Benicia Boy, and Tom’s backers being anxious that he should finish his
career as quickly as possible, and get into business, at once covered the
£50 of Heenan, and signed articles for Tom to fight him on or about the
day originally fixed for the fight with Jones, supposing it was the wish of
Heenan to step into Jones’s shoes. In this, however, the English managers
of the affair had mistaken the meaning of Mr. Wilkes’s letter, for on
their writing to him, with details of what had been done, the following
reply was forwarded:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="flushright">“Office, <cite>Wilkes’s Spirit</cite>, New York, Nov. 23, 1859.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;&#8203;Your letter of 3rd <abbr title="instant">inst.</abbr>, enclosing copy of articles for a fight between
Heenan and Sayers, and signed by the latter, for our acceptance, reached me yesterday, and
have been communicated to Heenan. We are all, however, taken by surprise at the proposal
that the fight should come off in February next, instead of at the expiration of the regular
six months, as was stipulated in the original proposition, and I am requested on Heenan’s
part to say, that he expects the usual preparatory term will be granted to him. By reference
to his cartel you will find he challenged Sayers to fight him near London for £200 and
the Champion’s belt, in six months from the date of his (Sayers) reception of that challenge,
or the date of the first deposit under it. This challenge having reached England during the
pendency of the engagement between Sayers and the Unknown, was kept in abeyance in
your hands, and having been further kept back by the next succeeding engagement of Sayers
with Jones, was not recognised or <em>received</em> by Sayers until after he had accepted forfeit
from Aaron Jones. Being thus left free of all engagements, he responded to the challenge
of Heenan, and on the 26th October (I believe) covered the £50 deposit which you had, for
months, held in Heenan’s name. The articles for this <em>new match</em>, however, were not signed
by Sayers until the 3rd Nov. <abbr title="instant">inst.</abbr>, and consequently Heenan claims that he is entitled to
six months’ preliminary time from either one or the other of those dates. He, however,
desires me to say that if there be anything in the rules of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P. R.</abbr> Benevolent Association
which entitles the Champion to reduce the term for meeting on his acceptance of a regular
six months’ challenge, he will conform to those rules, and fight Sayers at the indicated
time, even though it will leave him deficient of the due preparation; but he utterly repudiates
the idea (which the selection of February by Sayers perhaps infers) that his match
with Sayers is a continuation of the match with Jones. With this explanation he desires to
state that he will be ready to put up his second deposit of £50 at Owen Swift’s in London, on
the 15th December next, and if he be not represented at that time by any agent from this
country, he begs you will continue your past kindness and again put up the money for
him. Waiving no right, but conceding to all rules, he remains your obedient servant, though
very respectfully yours,</p>

<p class="pneg flushright">“GEORGE WILKES.”</p>
</div><!--end letter-->

<p>At first it was feared this would occasion a hitch in the match, but it
was not the case. Tom was nothing loth to let the affair take its course.
He had promised to give Heenan a chance, and would not disappoint him.
He proposed, therefore, to extend the time to the end of March, and a
missive with this proposition was despatched across the Atlantic, together
with a proposition from Tom that the stakes should be £500 a side, or as
much more as Heenan could get. Before, however, it could reach its destination,
a Mr. Falkland had left that country as the representative and
<a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a><span class="pageno">423</span>
forerunner of Heenan, prepared, immediately on his arrival, to do the
needful on his behalf. Early in December, Mr. Falkland presented himself
at the stakeholder’s, where he was met by some of the friends of
Sayers, but as Tom was not present it was agreed that the evening of
December 15, which was set apart for staking a further sum of £50 a side
at Owen Swift’s, should be selected for coming to terms. At Owen’s, on
the night in question, Tom made his appearance, and quickly fraternising
with the ambassador of his foe, found not the slightest difficulty in arranging
everything on that satisfactory footing upon which the match afterwards
stood. Mr. Falkland had instructions not to make the match for
more than £200, as Heenan could lay out the remainder of his money to
more advantage in bets, the odds being against him. The following day
articles were drawn in the approved form, and information was forthwith
despatched to Heenan that his presence in the Old Country was at once
required.</p>

<p>In the meantime, on the other side of the Atlantic, things had well nigh
tended to prevent the consummation of the wishes of the Fancy. John
Heenan and his quondam opponent Morrissey had got to loggerheads, and
Heenan proposed to fight Morrissey a second time before fighting Sayers.
Through the timely diplomacy of Mr. Wilkes, however, the difficulty was
solved, by Morrissey promising to give Heenan another chance, in either
England or America, for his own sum, should he prove fortunate enough
to defeat our Champion. With this promise the “Boy” was forced to be
content, and after innumerable hair-breadth escapes from warrants out
against him for an alleged breach of the peace, he succeeded (again thanks
to the good management of Mr. Wilkes) in getting on board the “Asia,”
which brought him to this country, landing at Liverpool on the 16th of
January, 1860.</p>

<p>Thenceforward all went serenely and smoothly; the whole of the
deposits were made good, and the 17th of April, 1860, was waited for
with feverish expectation.</p>

<p>Though it was made known to those who invested their gold in the
ticket for “there and back,” that the start must be made as early as
four o’clock, this had no effect in diminishing the number of those who
resolved to be “thar,” as our Yankee visitors expressed it.</p>

<p>The scene at Owen Swift’s and Harry Brunton’s, where tickets were
obtainable, beggars description, the rush was terrific, and many were
entirely unsuccessful in getting tickets at all. Nat Langham’s, Alec
<a name="Page_424" id="Page_424"></a><span class="pageno">424</span>
Keene’s, and other sporting houses were also crammed, but there was not
the same difficulty in carrying on the business of the landlord as at the first
houses named, where at one time trade was at a standstill. Many of the
frequenters of the sporting hostelries evidently determined to make a night
of it in order to make a certainty of being up betimes in the morning, and
that they carried their intentions fully into effect was plainly visible in their
countenances on their emerging into daylight. The more prudent ring-goers,
however, took time by the forelock, and early ensconced themselves
in their beds until the summons to be up and doing should arouse them.</p>

<p>The scene at London Bridge Station was one of continual bustle for at
least an hour before the time appointed for the start, and, judging from
the early arrivals, all seemed impressed with the necessity of taking time
by the forelock. The precincts of the station reminded us of the crush on
the Derby Day, but the effect was far more striking from the circumstance
of its being a “midnight flitting.” The company’s arrangements, however,
were such as to meet the pressing requirements, and the travellers by the
late trains from the provinces, and those who had postponed the purchase
of their tickets until the last moment were enabled to provide themselves
with the necessary passport at the last moment. Two monster trains were
prepared, and as early as half-past three the first, which consisted of thirty-three
carriages, was so full that the non-arrival of the men, both of whom
were accommodated at private lodgings close by, alone delayed its departure.
The Champion arrived first, and his fresh, brisk, and natty appearance
indicated a good night’s rest, and especial pains with his <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toilette</span>. He was
soon followed by Heenan, who seemed to wish to avoid recognition, and
instantly proceeded to a compartment reserved for him and his seconds.
The tickets were then collected, and at twenty minutes past four they
started on their journey. By this time night had cast off her sable mantle,
and day dawned with that peculiar tint which foretold the brilliant sunny
weather with which the expedition was favoured. Throughout the whole
of the metropolitan district, which extends for fifteen miles from
London, the police, both mounted and on foot, and all armed with cutlasses,
were on the look out on each side of the line even at this early hour,
but the speed at which the train proceeded at once satisfied those watchful
guardians that the mill was never intended to take place within their bailiwick,
after leaving which scarcely a soul was to be seen beyond husbandmen
proceeding to their daily avocations.</p>

<p>Great preparations were made to “stop the mill” further down, both on
<a name="Page_425" id="Page_425"></a><span class="pageno">425</span>
the Dover and Brighton lines; but they were unnecessary, as the travellers
turned off at Reigate Junction on to the Guildford line, along which the
train rattled at a good pace&mdash;&#8203;we may say, “in peaceful serenity”&mdash;&#8203;until
within a short distance of the latter old-fashioned country town, where the
first stoppage was made for water. In due course the journey was resumed,
and in a short time the travellers entered the wild district where the
military town of Aldershott is situated, the deserted appearance of which
satisfied all that the “pilot” to whom the selection of the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">locale</span> had been
entrusted had made a “happy choice.” It was near seven o’clock when the
first train discharged its living burthen at Farnborough station, after a most
pleasant journey through one of the prettiest counties in England, which,
illumined by a glorious sun, and shooting forth in vernal beauty, must have
inspired all with feelings of intense gratification; whilst the Benicia Boy
and the numerous Americans present must have been struck with the
highly favourable contrast to the miserable pilgrimage which from all
accounts preceded their representative’s last appearance in the Ring,
when he fought Morrissey in America.</p>

<p>No time was lost in choosing the spot for the ring, which was quickly
and well formed by the veteran Tom Oliver and his son, in a meadow
adjoining the railway, situate on the borders of Hampshire and Surrey,
and within half-a-mile of the Farnborough Station on the South Western
line. By this time the second train had reached its destination, and the
crowd could not have numbered fewer than twelve hundred persons, both of
high and low degree, though compared with former mills the present “congregation”
must unhesitatingly be pronounced the most aristocratic ever
assembled at the ring side. It included the bearers of names highly distinguished
in the pages of Burke and Debrett; officers of the army and navy,
members of Parliament, justices of the peace, and even brethren of the
cloth; whilst the muster of literati on behalf of the leading metropolitan
journals, and the most popular periodicals and miscellanies&mdash;&#8203;to say nothing
of the editorial and pictorial staffs of our American contemporaries, <cite>Wilkes’s
Spirit of the Times</cite> and <cite>Frank Leslie’s Illustrated News</cite>&mdash;&#8203;gave quite a new
feature to the gathering, and evinced at the same time the overwhelming interest
and excitement this national rivalry had created throughout both
hemispheres. The sale of inner-ring tickets (raised to 10s. each on this occasion)
produced a large revenue to the Pugilistic Benevolent Association,
and Billy Duncan’s speculation in chairs must have been a most successful
one, judging from the demand for those conveniences, by means of
<a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"></a><span class="pageno">426</span>
which the spectators were enabled to “see the fight” with comparative
comfort.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_29" id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span>

<p><span class="sc">Appearance of the Men.</span>&mdash;&#8203;All being in readiness, and the immense
crowd disposed in tolerable order by the exertions of those of the ring-keepers
who chose to do their duty, Tom Sayers appeared at the ring-side,
and having deposited his hat within the ropes, quickly followed it himself,
attended by his old pal, Harry Brunton, and the accomplished Jemmy
Welsh, as seconds. The Benicia Boy was not long in following his
example, attended by Jack Macdonald and his trainer, Cusick. Tom
looked as dapper and well set up as ever, and was full of smiles. “The
Boy” (aged 26), whose attire was not quite so fashionable, was also all on the
broad grin. They eyed one another curiously for a few seconds, this being, it
must be recollected, their first meeting, and then advancing, shook hands
most cordially together, each regarding the other with evident friendly
feeling. The warmth of the greeting appeared to give great satisfaction to
the surrounding multitude, who cheered vociferously. The men conversed
for a few minutes, but of course the subject of their interview did not
transpire. Umpires and a referee having now been appointed, the signal
was given to prepare for the combat. The first ceremony, that of tying
the colours to the stakes, was then proceeded with, and no time was cut to
waste in doffing their upper toggery. Each had taken the precaution to
put on his boots and drawers previous to entering the ring, so that the
usual tedious process of lacing the men’s boots was dispensed with. In
Heenan’s case, however, there would have been no necessity for this, as
his boots were of fashionable make, with elastic sides. He was the first to
appear in buff, and a single glance was sufficient to show that his condition
was all that could be desired by the most fastidious. Tom’s mahogany
bust was quickly after bared to the gaze of the multitude, and here, too,
was evidence of strict attention to his work. They had a last rub from
their seconds, and now advanced to give the final friendly shake. This
was the time to get a fair idea of their respective proportions, and in size
it really looked a horse to a hen. Heenan stood full four inches and a half
over Tom, and had an immense advantage in length. Every muscle on his
<a name="Page_427" id="Page_427"></a><span class="pageno">427</span>
broad back, his shoulders, and arms, was well developed, and gave evidence
of enormous power. His legs were rather light, but still there was
no lack here of wire and activity. His skin was exceedingly fair and transparent,
and shone like that of a thorough-bred. His mug was hard, and
looked older than we expected, his cheek-bones being very prominent,
and now that they had been denuded of much that was superfluous, his <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout
ensemble</span> was far more like that of his brother professional than on his first
interview with us. Tom looked brown and hard as nails: his well-knit
frame seemed fitter that we have seen it for years. He looked visibly
older even than when he fought Brettle, but, considering what he has
gone through, this is not to be wondered at. The only points in which
there appeared any advantage on his side were in his loins and his legs, which
were cast in a decidedly stronger mould than those of his towering opponent.
The contrast between them was far greater than between Tom and
the Tipton Slasher, and taking into consideration the fact that the advantage
in age on this occasion was t’other way, Tom’s work seemed indeed
cut out. That he had the remotest doubt as to the result we do not for an
instant believe. He smiled confidently, and had evidently made up his
mind to do or die. Heenan seemed to have an equally decided opinion as
to the termination of the battle, and, to use an expression of his own
countrymen, he was “all thar.” He won the toss for corners, and, of
course, placed himself with his back to the sun; and, in addition to this, he
had the advantage of being on slightly rising ground, so that Tom had all
the way through to fight up hill. The usual ceremony was now gone
through by the seconds and men. Time was called at twenty-nine minutes
past seven, and they commenced</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Heenan at once threw himself
into very fair position, his left well balanced
ready for a shoot, and the right across the
body. Tom’s position was the same as ever,
lightly but firmly planted on his pins. He
smiled and nodded, and on Heenan trying
to lead off his left got well back. Heenan
tried again, his reach being tremendous,
but again did Tom get well away. Tom now
essayed a draw, but “the Boy” was awake.
Each feinted and dodged to find out a weak
point, but for a short time each fortress was
too well guarded. At last Tom let go his
left and right, but out of distance. Heenan
shook his nob and grinned, then again tried
a lead, but was short. They got gradually to
Heenan’s corner, who appeared disposed to
fight on the defensive, and the sun being in
Tom’s eyes seemed to bother him not a
little. At length they came together, and
sharp left-handers were exchanged, Tom
getting on “the Boy’s” nose, drawing first
blood, and Heenan leaving his sign manual
on Tom’s frontispiece. Heavy counter-hits
followed, Tom again getting on the nose,
and receiving on the nob. More sparring
ensued to a close, when Heenan seized Tom
round the neck, but Tom pegged away at
the back of his head until he made him leave
that, and Tom fell laughing.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Heenan showed marks of Tom’s handiwork
on the back of his neck, and Tom’s
forehead was flushed. Heenan kept to his
corner, whither Tom went to draw him out;
<a name="Page_428" id="Page_428"></a><span class="pageno">428</span>
when he thought Tom was near enough,
“the Boy” lunged out his left, but Tom
stopped him and got back. Heenan tried
again, and just reached Tom’s nose. After
one or two feints a pretty counter took
place, Tom getting on the nose, and receiving
a sharp one over the right eye. Heenan
then closed, got well hold of him, and threw
the Champion, falling heavily on him.
Offers to take 2 to 1.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;After a little lively fiddling, Tom got
too near to the big’un, who instantly slung
out his left straight and full on the bridge
of Tom’s beak, knocking him clean off his
pins. (“First knock-down” for Heenan.)</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, on coming up, looked rather
astonished, and his eyes blinked in the sun
like a dissipated owl. Heenan went at once
to him at the scratch, dodged him, and once
more planted a heavy spank with his left,
this time on the jaw, and down went Tom
again, amidst the shouts of the Yankees,
who now offered 6 to 4 on Heenan. The
Sayers party looked excessively blue.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Tom’s mug showed visible marks of
“the Boy’s” powers of hitting. He was
cautious, and kept away from his man; Jack
followed, and letting go his left on the
mouth was well countered by Tom on the
proboscis. Heenan now bored in, and after
dodging Tom, got again heavily on the
sneezer, and Tom fell.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Tom’s countenance, though not
swelled, was much flushed, while the Boy
was almost scatheless. He was somewhat
wild, and tried both hands, but missed.
Counter-hits ensued, in which Tom received
the full weight of Heenan’s ponderous fist on
his right arm, which was driven back
against his face. Tom reached Heenan’s
left cheek, leaving his mark. Heenan retaliated
on the right brow, and Tom fell.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Tom’s right peeper displayed marks
of pepper, and it was perceptible that he
had sustained severe injury to his right arm,
which was beginning to swell, and which
he now kept close to his body, as if to support
it. Still he went to Heenan in his corner,
and that hero delivered his left, but
not effectively, on the chest. Tom danced
away, and as he turned round napped a
little one from the right on his back. He
was quickly out of harm’s way, and, coming
again, dodged his man until he let fly, when
Tom countered him heavily on the right
cheek, drawing the claret and raising a considerable
bump. The blow staggered Heenan,
who stood all of a heap for a moment.
Soon did he collect himself, and as Tom
came again, lodged a little one on the nose,
but was once more countered very
heavily on the right cheek, the cut being
increased and the bump enlarged. Slight
exchanges followed, in which Tom received
on the right eye and Heenan on the right
cheek, whereupon Heenan went to his corner
for a sponge. He seemed in no hurry to
come away, and Tom stood in the middle of
the ring until Heenan went slowly to him,
and tried his left, but it was no go. He tried
again, but only just reached Tom’s brow.
Tom now feinted and got home on the right
peeper, Heenan missing an upper-cut. Tom
danced away, came again on another tack,
and bang went his left on the sore spot, a
heavy spank, and he was instantly out of
danger, laughing; Heenan rushed after him,
but was well stopped, thrice in succession.
Again and again Tom went to him, and
baulked his efforts to effect a lodgment, and
then Heenan napped another slashing crack
on the right cheek, which had the effect of
at once closing his dexter goggle. He retreated
for a wipe, and was followed by Tom,
and some mutual cautious dodging and feinting
took place. At last Heenan got on the
top of Tom’s smeller, but not heavily, and
Tom then avoided another attempt. Once
more did Heenan retire to Jack Macdonald
for consolation and advice; Tom walking
round and eying him in an inquisitive manner,
as if admiring his handiwork. Tom,
after satisfying his curiosity, went close,
and slight exchanges followed, without mischief.
Heenan tried his left and was stopped.
Both very cautious, and neither disposed to
go within gunshot. Heenan now led off and
got slightly on the mouth with his left,
Tom retaliating on the closed peeper. Mutual
taps and stops, and then Tom got his
left heavily on the old spot another cracker,
whereupon Heenan once more retired into
the privacy of his corner, amidst cries of 2
to 1 on Sayers. Tom, after a few turns
and a touch of the sponge, went to him, but
Heenan shook his nob and seemed disinclined
for work. Tom finding he could not
draw him, retreated, whereupon “the Boy”
came out, and let go his left viciously, which
was beautifully stopped. He then feinted,
and got well on the bridge of Tom’s snorer
as he was retreating, and again knocked
him off his pins. Tom rolled over, laughing,
and was carried to his corner. This
round lasted 13 minutes, and was a fine specimen
of stratagem and skill, especially on
the part of Tom. His right arm now was
much swollen, and so painful that he could
make little or no use of it.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Tom slowest to the call of time, but
directly he was at the scratch “the Boy” retired
to his corner, whither Tom had to follow
him. Heenan at once let go his left,
but Tom laughed and jumped back. A
slight exchange followed, and Tom napped
a straight one on the sniffer. Heenan now
missed a couple of well-meant shots, and
Tom jumped away from a third, and as he
turned his back upon Heenan got a right-hander
on the back of the neck. Heenan
followed him up, but Tom grinned and
jumped nimbly away. His activity on his
pins was as remarkable as ever. Heenan
pursued him, and at last lodged his left
slightly on the nozzle, and once more turned
on the tap. Tom, however, countered him
<a name="Page_429" id="Page_429"></a><span class="pageno">429</span>
on the damaged cheek, which caused “the
Boy” to retire for the kind offices of Jack
Macdonald. On Tom’s going to him he let
go his left on the kisser, drawing the carmine,
and this led to pretty exchanges at
long shots on the cheek. Heenan at this
time appeared weak, and the hopes of the
Sayers party were greatly in the ascendant.
Heenan preferred his corner to the scratch,
and Tom had some difficulty in persuading
him to leave. This he at last accomplished,
and some beautiful stops were made on both
sides. Another break away ensued, after
which they countered effectively, but Tom
was heaviest on the right cheek, which was
now swelled as big as two. Heenan’s blow
alighted on Tom’s oration trap, and drew
more of the ruby. On his trying to repeat
this lodgment, Tom stopped him cleverly.
Capital exchanges followed, in which Tom
was again at home on the cheek very heavily.
Heenan rushed at him, but Tom was away,
and after once or twice being baulked Heenan
again retired to his corner. After Tom
had scrutinized him carefully, he rubbed
his hands and went to him, whereupon
Heenan let fly his left, but Tom got well
away laughing; Heenan shook his head and
also laughed good-humouredly. Tom now
crept in, and pop went his left on the plague-spot,
and off went the Champion laughing.
More dodging and stopping on both sides,
until Tom was once more on the cheek a
slogger. Heenan retaliated sharply on the
bridge of the snout, but was stopped in a
second attempt, and Tom nailed him on the
right cheek very heavily and got away.
Heenan tried to take the lead, but Tom
jumped back. “The Boy,” persevering, got
well on the forehead, but was unsuccessful
in a second essay. The first was sufficient
to leave a bump on the gallant Tom. More
sparring until a severe counter-exchange took
place, in which Tom got a hot’un on the
whistler, which shook his ivories, and turned
on a fresh tap. It was a staggerer, but Tom
recovered and went to his man, when more
severe counters were interchanged, Heenan
getting another rum one on the cheek, and
dropping his left with effect on Tom’s
sneezer. Both now indulged in a wipe, and
washed their mouths out. They came again,
now like giants refreshed, and each in turn
tried a lead, but each was well stopped.
Tom’s right arm, from the continual stopping
such a heavy cannonade as Heenan’s,
was now much discoloured and swollen, and
utterly useless for all purposes of hitting,
and he was thus deprived of his principal
weapon. After a good deal of this another
heavy exchange followed, in which Tom was
at home on the old spot, and Heenan on the
jaw heavily, knocking Tom once more off his
pins. This round lasted 20 minutes, and
was a splendid specimen of milling on both
sides. Tom’s nose and mouth were bleeding,
but both his eyes were well open. His
arm was his chief drawback. Heenan’s right
eye had been long closed, his cheek was
fearfully swollen, and his mouth was also
somewhat out of straight.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Heenan came up as if he intended
to force the fighting. He led off viciously,
but Tom got well away. “The Boy” followed
him closely, and at last got on
Tom’s mouth, drawing more of the juice.
He followed suit on the snuffer-tray with
a like result, and counter-hits ensued,
in which each did mischief. Heenan continued
to bore in, and at last Tom, after
getting a little one on the back, dropped
laughing.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Tom was very slow to the call of
time, and appeared to want nursing. It
was evidently heavy work struggling against
such superior mettle. He stood in the middle
of the ring until Heenan went to him,
when slight counter-hits were exchanged;
after which they closed. Heenan lifted
Tom from the ground and threw him heavily
with the greatest ease.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, again very much behindhand
in coming to time, and the friends of
Heenan did not appear in much hurry.
When they did come up Tom had to go into
Heenan’s corner. After a dodge or two
Tom got his right on the good eye rather
heavily, but it was not such a right-hander
as of yore, and evidently gave him pain.
Heenan returned on the chest, and Tom
fell.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;“Time, Time!” neither too ready.
On Sayers at last facing his man, Heenan
caught him, but not very heavily, on the
jaw, and dropped on the saving suit.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Heenan, first to leave his second’s
knee, now went to Tom, and after a dodge
or two popped the left very straight on Tom’s
nose, once more knocking him clean off his
legs. He turned round on returning to his
corner, and looking to Mr. Falkland, his
umpire, exclaimed, “That’s one for you,
Fred!” Offers were now made to lay 5 to
4 on Heenan, but the takers seemed scarce.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, very weak, came up cautiously
and slowly, his nose being large enough for
two. Heenan, seeing Tom’s state, tried to
force the fighting, but Tom got cleverly out
of the difficulty. Heenan followed him up,
and popped a rattler on the throat, without
a return. He paused, and then sent a little
one on the scent-bottle, but Tom countered
him well and straight on the nose, drawing
the crimson in profusion. Heenan, nothing
daunted, let go his left, and was stopped.
He then swung round his right heavily on
the jaw. They got to close quarters and
some heavy in-fighting took place, in which
Tom was very busy. At length both were
down heavily, Heenan under.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Neither seemed in a hurry to leave
his second’s knee, but Tom was slowest in
answering the call. Heenan at once went
to him, got the left well on the proboscis
and his right on the jaw, and down again
fell the Champion in a heap.
</p>
<a name="Page_430" id="Page_430"></a><span class="pageno">430</span>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Tom shook himself together, but
was very cautious. He sparred as if requiring
rest, until Heenan came in, when
slight exchanges took place, Tom getting it
on the nose, and Heenan on the whistler,
but neither very heavily. Heenan then
made a sudden dart, and planting heavily
on Tom’s mouth, once more knocked him
off his legs. (Loud cheers for Heenan.)</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Tom did not display many marks
from his repeated knock-down blows, but
came up smiling, although somewhat tired.
Heenan’s mug was decidedly the most disfigured,
being so much swelled. Heenan
took the lead, but did not get heavily on.
He tried again with his right, but the blow
passed over Tom’s nob. Counter hits followed
on the nose, in which Tom’s delivery
was most effective, but Tom was down.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Very slight exchanges, followed by
a heavy counter, in which Heenan’s mouth
came in for pepper, and Tom got it slightly
on the nose, and fell.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Tom slow to time; Heenan not in a
hurry. At last, on facing one another,
Heenan went in to a close, and, throwing
Tom, fell on him.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;Heenan followed Sayers, who was on
the retreat, and after one or two dodges,
caught him on the jaw heavily with his
right. He tried again, but Tom jumped
back. Still he persevered, and heavy exchanges
followed at close quarters, and both
were in the end down at the ropes.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Sayers very slow, which Heenan
seeing, dashed at him, slung out the left on
the nose, and again floored the Champion.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;Tom seemed none the worse for this
floorer; it rather seemed to do him good,
for he came fresher, which Heenan seeing,
he retired to his corner. Tom followed and
tried to deliver, but missed, and the Benicia
Boy dropped him with another straight one
on the jaw. Heenan’s left hand was now much
puffed, and did not seem to leave such impressions
as formerly.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;The time was very badly kept on
both sides, and there were now complaints
that the Benicia Boy was allowed a stool in
the ring. An appeal was made to the
referee, who at once ordered its removal, as
contrary to the laws. Heenan rushed at
Tom, who retreated and got one on the
back. Tom then turned round and missed
his right. They closed, and Tom pegged
away merrily on the nose and left cheek,
and in the end both down, Tom under.
One hour and eleven minutes had now
elapsed.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;The Benicia Boy, first up, tried his
left by a sudden dart, but was stopped.
An attempt with the right just landed on
the side of Tom’s nut, and he fell. (5 to 4
on Heenan still offered.)</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, weak, came up slow, but cheerful.
He waited the attack, which was not
long in coming, and after getting a little
one on the side of his head, Tom popped
his left very heavily on the snout, drawing
more home-brewed. Heenan, wild, rushed
in and bored Tom down.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, fresher, came up gaily, and
tried to lead off with his left, but the Boy
stopped him prettily. Another effort landed
on Heenan’s good eye. Heenan in return
planted a rattler on Tom’s jaw with his
right, which staggered him, and was all but
a knock down. Tom soon shook himself
together, whereupon Heenan let fly his left,
but Tom was well away. Following up, “the
Boy” got on Tom’s chest, but not heavily.
Exchanges; Heenan on the ’tato-trap, and
Tom on the nose, a smasher, each drawing
the cork. Heavy counters followed with the
left, and they broke away. Heenan came
again, and got on Tom’s snorer heavily with
his left, once more staggering him. Twice
after this did Tom stop Heenan’s right and
they closed. After some slight fibbing Tom
fell, Heenan hitting him when down. An
appeal of foul was overruled, the blow being
obviously accidental.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;“The Boy” came up determined and
led off, but Tom was away. A second attempt
was equally unsuccessful, and as Tom
turned his back to dash away, the Boy
caught him on the neck, but not heavily.
Sharp exchanges followed, Tom on the left
cheek and nose, and “the Boy” on the mouth.
Heenan then went in and tried his left, but
was short, whereupon he retired to his corner,
had a wipe, and wetted his whistle,
and then went to the middle of the ring.
Tom joined issue at once, and some heavy
exchanges took place, each on the nose, and
Heenan now tried to close, reaching after
Tom to catch him round the neck. Tom
kept out of harm’s way, but at length “the
Boy” bored him down at the ropes.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Both much fatigued, wanted all the
time they could get. After some sparring,
Heenan ran at Tom, who darted away. The
Boy rapidly pursued, and they got together,
and in the fibbing Tom was busy on Heenan’s
good cheek, while he caught it on the mouth.
In the end Tom was down.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;Tom still slow to time. The Boy at
once went to him, and got heavily on the
top of his nut. Tom countered with effect
with his right on the left cheek, and then
popped his left on the proboscis. Heavy
exchanges followed in Tom’s favour, who met
“the Boy” very straight and effectively on
the nozzle, opening a fresh bin. A break
away, followed by slight exchanges, led to a
harmless close, and Tom slipped down.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;Heenan’s other eye was now quickly
closing, and he had evidently no time to lose.
He was strongest on his legs, but his punishment
was far more visible than Tom’s.
He tried to lead off, but Tom met him
neatly on the nose, turning on the red port.
“The Boy” rushed at Tom, and literally ran
over and fell on him.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;After standing some time in his corner,
Heenan was fetched out by Tom, who
<a name="Page_431" id="Page_431"></a><span class="pageno">431</span>
had now recovered a little. A short spar
was followed by another retreat, after which
Tom went in and got a little ’un on the left
cheek, but it lacked steam. More sparring,
and Heenan again retired. Tom stood and
examined him with the eye of a connoisseur
until he came out, when good exchanges
took place, Tom getting heavily on the
mouth, and Heenan on the nose. A break
away; more sparring for wind; Heenan
again to his corner. On Tom going at him
he slung out his left heavily on the nose,
and prone once more fell the brave Champion.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;Tom all alive, dodged, and caught
“the Boy” on the chin. He turned to retreat,
and “the Boy” nailed him on the body, but
not heavily. Heenan then tried repeatedly to
draw Tom, but the latter would not go into
Heenan’s corner. “The Boy,” therefore, had
to go out, and some rapid hits and stops followed,
without any apparent damage; each,
however, got a small tap on the mouth.
Heenan having taken another rest in his
corner, came out, and got a hot one on the
left cheek for his pains, which all but shut
up the other eye. This brought on exchanges,
each on the mazzard, and then
Heenan reached Tom’s nose. Heavy determined
counter-deliveries on the note ensued,
after which Heenan floored Tom by a
right-hander on the cheek. The betting was
now even, Sayers for choice. It was obvious
that, strong as Heenan was, unless he
could make a decided change, he must in a
very few minutes be blind.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;The Benicia Boy, feeling he had no
time to lose, rushed in, but only just reached
Tom’s chest. Both seemed fagged, and they
stood a few seconds, and then went to close
quarters, where Tom, as usual, was busy on
“the Boy’s” frontispiece, until he let him
slip through his arms on to the ground.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Heenan again tried to force the
fighting, but Tom got away. They then
stood and sparred until Heenan let fly his
left, which did not reach its destination. He
retired for counsel, and then came at Tom
and tried his right at the body, but without
success. Steady exchanges led to close and
rapid in-fighting, and both fell, Tom under.
Heenan’s eye all but closed up.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;The Benicia Boy dashed viciously in,
and caught Tom on the snout, but the blow
was without powder. Tom retreated from
the vigorous onslaught; Heenan followed
and got home on the jaw with the right, still
with no effect. Tom now turned and ran,
Heenan after him, when, on turning round,
Tom napped one on the nose. He, however,
landed another little pop on the good
eye. Sharp exchanges at close quarters
ended in the downfall of Tom. Two hours
had now elapsed.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;The Benicia Boy’s face was a spectacle
to behold, while Tom was very weak.
The Boy rushed to a close, and caught Tom
round the neck, dragging him to the ropes.
At this time, the police, who had been gradually
making their way to the ring, began
a violent struggle to get close and put a stop
to hostilities. “The Boy” tried to hold Tom,
but the latter slipped through his arms and
fell.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;Tom was first up, and seemed the
better man; he made his left twice on Heenan’s
eye, and the latter at length caught him
round the neck at the ropes and there held
him. Tom’s efforts to extricate himself
were vain, but he administered severe
punishment to Heenan’s face. The police at
this time got closer, there was a rush to the
ropes from all sides, and we, in company
with others, including the referee, were
completely shut out from the view. We
are informed that the round ended in both
going to grass at the expiration of <em>two
hours and six minutes</em>. We had hoped that the
men would now have been withdrawn, as the
referee had been forced from his post, and the
police were close by. The battle, so far as
it may be called a battle, was for the time
over, and the men should have been taken
away. However, although the referee sent
orders for a cessation of hostilities, five
more so-called rounds were fought, with
pretty equal advantage. Heenan’s right eye
was fast closing, his left being in complete
darkness. The ring was half full of
people, however, and neither man had
a fair chance. Much do we regret the
unpleasant duty that now is imposed
upon us, of finding fault with the Benicia
Boy for conduct which was not only unmanly,
but quite against the rules of the
Ring, and had the Referee been present,
would inevitably have lost him the
battle. We can ourselves declare, as an impartial
eye witness of the mêlée, that in
the fourth of these supplementary rounds,
while Sayers was on his second’s knee,
Heenan rushed at him in a very excited
state, let fly left and right at Tom’s seconds,
floored them, and kicked at them when on the
ground in desperate style, after which he
closed with Sayers, and after a wild rally,
they fell together. The final round was
merely a wild scramble, in which both fell.
The referee by this time was able to get near
again, and ordered the men to desist from
fighting. Immediately after this Heenan
rushed away from the ring, and ran some
distance with the activity of a deer, proving
that as far as strength was concerned, he
was as fit as ever; but he had not been away
from the ring many minutes before he was
totally blind. Tom Sayers, although a little
tired, and suffering from his arm and the desperate
hug in the 37th round, was also strong
on his pins, and could have fought some time
longer. The blues being now in force, there
was, of course, no chance of the men again
meeting, and an adjournment was necessary.
It was found that the authorities were up in
arms in all directions, so that it would be
mere waste of time to go elsewhere. Backward
<a name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a><span class="pageno">432</span>
home was therefore the word, and the
men and their friends returned to the
Metropolis shortly after three o’clock. The
whole time occupied, up to the men’s leaving
the ring, was two hours and twenty
minutes.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Up to the unfortunate departure
of the referee, this was decidedly the very
best Championship fight we ever witnessed.
It was to the time aforesaid fought out
with a manliness, a fairness, and a determination
on both sides worthy of the
highest commendation. Without any attempt
at shifting, each scorned to take a
mean advantage, and loudly and repeatedly
was each of them cheered. The game displayed
on both sides was remarkable. The
gluttony and bottom of Tom Sayers are too
proverbial to need further comment at our
hand; but as certain rumours had been
flying about to the effect that Heenan was
destitute of those qualities, we deem it right
to express our belief that a gamer, more
determined fellow, never pulled off a shirt.
His punishment was terrible, and yet he
took it round after round without flinching,
and almost invariably with a smile on his
face. We are bound to own that in this, as
in his talent, he very agreeably disappointed
us; and had we not known his career, we
certainly should never have set him down
for a novice. He has an excellent delivery
with his left, which was as straight as a dart,
and early in the fight was very heavy. It
appears to us, however, that his hands are
not strong, for before half the battle was
got through his left hand was so much
swelled as to be almost useless; and this,
doubtless, was fortunate for Tom, who with
his right arm gone, could have made but a
poor stand against such a weapon had it retained
its original hardness. Of his right
Heenan makes but little use. Of his conduct
at the conclusion of the battle we cannot
speak in too strong terms. We trust it
was occasioned by the state of excitement in
which he was owing to the ring being broken,
and by the fact that, being almost blind, he
took the unoffending seconds of his opponent
for some other persons. The state of
Heenan’s eyesight was shown by the
fact that he hit out with both hands at
Jemmy Welsh, who wore a red and black
striped woollen shirt, mistaking him
for his antagonist. Of Tom Sayers we
need not say more than that he fought the
battle throughout with consummate tact
and judgment, and, considering that his
right arm (his principal weapon) was rendered
almost useless from the commencement,
too much praise cannot be awarded
to him for his courage and coolness. We
are of opinion, even without that arm, that
he would eventually have pulled through,
had the fight been finished on the day. But
it is useless speculating on possibilities or
probabilities. On the question of nationality,
the only point that has been decided, and
the only point in our opinion requiring decision,
is that both England and America
possess brave sons, and each country had
reason to be proud of the Champion she had
selected. Both were, doubtless, anxious to
have it settled; but for ourselves, were we
asked, we should say each is so good that he
is deserving a belt, and we would call on our
countrymen to subscribe for such a trophy
as a reward for Heenan’s enterprise and
boldness in coming, as he has done, to face
the British Champion on his own ground.</p>

<p>The writer of these lines, having been one of the less than half-dozen
sporting writers and reporters who remained among the driving crowd
which swayed hither and thither in the broken ring after the departure of
the referee, and as several of these, notably <cite>The Times</cite> reporter, wrote their
published accounts from hearsay, feels himself freely entitled to express
his unbiassed opinion on the probable result of the battle, and to describe
“the occurrents of the fight,” in its last struggles, from the avouchment
of his own eyesight.</p>

<p>The fight, which began at twenty-four minutes past seven, was over at a
quarter to ten, lasting two hours and twenty minutes.</p>

<p>When the ring was broken in, in the thirty-seventh round, and the
referee shut out from view, Heenan, who was fast becoming blind, hugged
Sayers on the ropes. The ropes were lowered by Tom’s friends, doubtless,
but were not cut. Had the referee been there, he would unquestionably
have ordered the round to have been closed. Rule 28 of the Ring Code
<a name="Page_433" id="Page_433"></a><span class="pageno">433</span>
was as follows, <em>before</em> the Farnborough fight. It has since been enlarged
in its scope to prevent similar dangerous practices more effectually:&mdash;&#8203;“28.
Where a man shall have his antagonist across the ropes in such a position
as to be helpless, and to endanger his life by strangulation or apoplexy, it
shall be in the power of the referee to direct the seconds to take their man
away, and thus conclude the round; and that the man or his seconds
refusing to obey the direction of the referee shall be deemed the loser.”
Of this the Yankee scribes chose to be utterly oblivious, though the articles
specified the battle to be under the New Rules of the Ring&mdash;&#8203;<i>i.e.</i>, those of
1853. The referee, however, so say the American party, sent an order
for the cessation of hostilities. This, though since confirmed, was not
believed by Sayers’ friends, who, seeing victory within his grasp, thought
it a mere <em>ruse</em> to obtain a drawn battle.</p>

<p>Five rounds were thereafter fought, Heenan’s sight being so defective
that, in the fourth of these, the forty-first, Heenan rushed from his corner
while Sayers was on his second’s knee, and, letting fly at Jemmy Welsh,
knocked him nearly over, and kicked at Harry Brunton, if he did not
strike him, of which we are not certain. He then hugged Sayers, and
they both fell; Tom hitting up sharply in Heenan’s battered frontispiece.
A cry was raised that the referee had declared the fight over, whereon
Heenan rushed from the ring with great activity, followed by his clamorous
friends. We stayed, and found Sayers strong, with his sight good, and in
all respects but his injured dexter arm&mdash;&#8203;of little use since the fourth
round&mdash;&#8203;able, as he said, “to fight an hour.”</p>

<p>Leaving Tom, we hurried to the carriages, the train standing on the
Farnborough embankment, where we saw Heenan, already blind as a bat,
lifted into his compartment. Arrived at the Bricklayers’ Arm Station, we
accompanied the gallant Champion to the hostelrie of his old friend, Ned
Elgee, “The Swan,” Old Kent Road. Here no sooner was the hero seated,
for he refused to go to bed, than he inquired after his opponent. His
friend and backer (Mr. John Gideon) suggested that the heroes should
meet and shake hands, and the writer of this hastened across the road to
invite the Benicia Boy and his friends to an interview. He was in a close
cab wrapped in blankets&mdash;&#8203;blind, unpresentable, and seemingly unconscious.
Tom was soon cheerful, and over a little tea regretted that the doctor’s
veto prevented his partaking of the champagne creaming around him to his
health and success, amid plaudits to his bravery.</p>

<p>Sayers was next morning at Norfolk Street, at the stakeholder and
<a name="Page_434" id="Page_434"></a><span class="pageno">434</span>
referee’s office, and a photograph has fixed beyond dispute his condition,
which, save his right arm already spoken of, was nothing beyond a tumefied
mouth and a few bumps on his hard forehead. Heenan, on the contrary,
despite the absurd declarations of his American letter-writer, was not in a
condition to see or be seen. For fully forty-eight hours he was in “darkness,”
in bed in an upper-room at Osborne’s Hotel in the Adelphi, and for
more than that time in a critical condition, as we know from unimpugnable
proof. The friends of Heenan pretended to base their great grievance on
the fact that, as the contest was not finished on the day, it ought to have been
resumed during the week. The answer to this is, first, that this was mere
bounce, as Heenan was in no condition to resume hostilities; secondly, that
in the condition of Sayers’s right arm he was entitled, by Ring precedents
(the fight having been once interrupted) to a reasonable period to recover
its use; thirdly, that it would have been contrary to all dictates of humanity&mdash;&#8203;and
fairness, which includes humanity, is a prized attribute of British
boxing; fourthly, that public opinion was opposed in the strongest manner
to the two brave fellows who had so heroically contended, and had been
baulked of a result by no fault or shortcoming of either, after such punishment
as they had undergone, renewing their interrupted struggle. For
these and other cogent reasons, it was proposed by the referee and stakeholder,
and&mdash;&#8203;after the subsidence of the American mortification to a better
state of feeling&mdash;&#8203;agreed to by both men, that two similar belts should be
made, one to be presented to each champion.</p>

<p>We shall not record the ceremonial of this presentation&mdash;&#8203;which was performed
on the part of England by Frank Dowling, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, editor of <cite>Bell’s
Life</cite>, and on that of America by G. Wilkes, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, editor of the <cite>New
York Spirit of the Times</cite>&mdash;&#8203;as the whole affair, speeches and all, savour too
strongly of the circus style of bunkum and bombast. The modest paragraph
in the <cite>Times</cite> of May 30th, 1860, though written as an <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avant courrier</span>, is
more to our taste:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<span class="sc">The Championship Belts.</span>&mdash;&#8203;America and England shake hands cordially to-day. What
our greatest diplomatists and engineers have failed to achieve has been accomplished by the
Benicia Boy and Tom Sayers, whose fame will descend to future generations, and whose
posterity will each be enabled to show a <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">fac-simile</span> of that much desired ‘belt,’ so boldly
challenged, so manfully defended. The Atlantic cable has not linked the two nations
together, but the good feeling which has been shown by the two gladiators, who on this day
receive at the Alhambra their respective ‘belts,’ will be responded to by the two
nations on either side of the Atlantic. We have been favoured with a view of the old belt,
‘the belt’ still open to competition, and of the two other belts to be presented to the ‘two
Champions of England,’ for such is the inscription upon the case of each. Both are
precisely similar in every respect, and the somewhat clumsy workmanship, in frosted silver,
carefully copied from the original, is by Mr. C. F. Hancock, of Bruton Street.”
</p>
<a name="Page_435" id="Page_435"></a><span class="pageno">435</span>

<p>How British admiration of true courage expressed itself in the substantial
form of a public subscription, and how Members of Parliament, the
Stock Exchange, Lloyd’s, and Mark Lane, clubbed their gold pieces to
enable the Champion to pass in peace and competence the remainder of his
days, guarded from the stings and sorrows of poverty, have been told in
the columns of the contemporary sporting press.</p>

<p>After Mace’s victories over Sam Hurst and Tom King, there was some
talk of Sayers coming out from his retirement and having a turn with the
Norwich man, but it ended in smoke. As Tom, from the universal interest
excited by his heroic display, was an object of interest to the multitude,
he received liberal offers from some Yankee circus proprietors, and by the
aid of the “rhino” thus earned became first a shareholder, and then
proprietor of Howes and Cushing’s Circus, under the management of Jem
Myers. The speculation, we suspect, carried Tom out of his depth, and
the horses, mules, carriages, <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> were sold off some twelve months after
their purchase. Tom’s free living degenerated into excess during this
loose and excited life of a travelling showman and exhibitor; for poor
Tom, in his simple faith, was by no means an Artemus Ward, and no
match for Yankee smartness. There is little doubt that Tom at this time
laid the seeds of the inflammatory disease which shortened his days, and
cut him off at the early age of thirty-nine.</p>

<p>The kind friends who uncompromisingly stipulated, when Tom’s capital
was invested, that he should “fight no more,” did not place any restriction
on his re-appearance in the roped arena. When King and Heenan fought, on
December 10, 1863, Sayers conformed to the etiquette of his profession,
and seconded “the American.” Heenan’s party evidently believed that
Tom’s <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prestige</span> would scatter dismay in the ranks of King’s followers, and
help to overwhelm the “jolly young waterman” at the outset. Poor
Sayers’ descent had, however, commenced, and when he stepped into the
ring, in Heenan’s corner, it was plain he was there more for dramatic
effect than anything else. Attired in a fur cap, a yellow flannel jacket,
and jack-boots, he was vociferously applauded when he commenced his
duties in attending to Heenan’s toilette. Even then people said, “How are
the mighty fallen,” for poor Tom was no more equal to his onerous task than
a child. During the fight at Wadhurst he looked in strange bewilderment
at King and Heenan, and when the “Benicia Boy” required assistance,
his second was perfectly helpless. Still the gladiator quitted the scene in
a graceful and generous manner, in having stood esquire to the opponent
<a name="Page_436" id="Page_436"></a><span class="pageno">436</span>
who was instrumental in bringing out that steel, courage, and pluck of
which the first of English pugilists was composed.</p>

<p>As it no doubt will prove interesting to all those who have admired
the wonderful pluck and endurance of the greatest gladiator of modern
times to know something of the progress of that insidious disease which
gradually but surely did its work, we append a few particulars. Since the
memorable battle of Farnborough&mdash;&#8203;when Sayers appeared in the ring the
picture of health, and the result proved that his <em>physique</em> could not have
been improved upon&mdash;&#8203;he now and again showed symptoms of the hectic
flush which is the precursor of an affection of the lungs. This was brought
on by the course of life he subsequently chose, or rather by the force of
circumstances under which he was placed. Unable to fall back upon the
pleasures of a cultivated mind from want of education, Tom became the
idol of his fellows; he cast off all those restraints which had secured for
him health and victory, and plunged into excesses of living&mdash;&#8203;late hours
and dissipation. Nature’s laws are not to be broken with impunity, and
in the beginning of 1866 he fell into a very low condition, and betrayed
symptoms of consumption, aggravated with diabetes, for which Mr. Adams,
F.R.C.S., attended him on February 20, at his sister’s, Mrs. King’s, 16,
Claremont Square, Pentonville. His robust and healthy frame exhibited a
great change for the worse, and the doctor then feared, from his having
wasted away so much, coughing frequently, and losing strength fast, that
he was sinking into a decline. He was ready to acknowledge his physical
weakness, but when told of the serious nature of the disease then apprehended,
he became as docile as a child, and obeyed the injunctions of his
medical adviser, who, we may remark in passing, expressed to us the melancholy
pleasure which he experienced whilst Tom was under his care.
However, the dreaded enemy was stalled-off by careful watching and
nursing, and he recovered sufficiently to take a trip to Brighton about the
middle of April. When there, he appeared strong and robust, and like
his former self. This, however, was not to last long, for at the end of
August he returned to his sister’s, in Claremont Square, and in a consultation
held there between Dr. Adams and Mr. Brown, they came to the
conclusion that actual and absolute disease of the lungs had set in, and
that he could not survive many weeks. He took a fancy to go to his old
friend’s, Mr. Mensley, High Street, Camden Town, on October 16, and
there he stayed until he died. For the satisfaction of Dr. Adams himself,
that gentleman called in Dr. Gull to consult, but they both agreed that
<a name="Page_437" id="Page_437"></a><span class="pageno">437</span>
nothing more could be done to save him. A reaction took place in his
condition after being a fortnight at Mr. Mensley’s; he seemed to get
fresher and stronger, and for a week remained in a doubtful state, giving
hopes to his friends that he would survive the illness. A relapse came on,
and with it unconsciousness, and for the last few days he had only a few
intervals of consciousness. Mr. Litten, assistant chaplain of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pancras,
attended by desire of Sayers, and administered the consolations of religion.
He passed away at six o’clock on Wednesday evening, November 7th, in
the presence of his father, with his two children at hand. For upwards of
four-and-twenty hours before his death he was in a state of semi-insensibility,
and could only recognise his friends on being aroused and appealed
to. But the great change came with comparative peace at last, and when
nature compelled him to “throw up the sponge,” he left the world, let us
hope, without that pain which no man feared less when he stood up in
defence of his reputation as the Emperor of British boxers. Many were
the inquiries made for the health of poor Tom, and it is satisfactory
to know that he was visited by some who had taken a part against
him in the battle-field, and that he bid them, each and all, a peaceful
farewell.</p>

<p>The amount of money subscribed for Sayers by his personal admirers
and the public was £3,000, which sum was invested in the names of trustees,
Tom to receive the interest during his life, providing he never fought
again; and, in the event of his fighting again or dying, the interest was to
go to the children until of age, when it was to be divided between them.
Tom left only two children&mdash;&#8203;young Tom, then at boarding-school, and
fourteen years old, and Sarah, in her seventeenth year. Independent of
the interest in this sum, Sayers left a considerable amount of property in
plate and other valuables. Some of his backers have treasured up <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">souvenirs</span>
of him. Mr. John Gideon, Tom’s earliest “guide, philosopher, and friend,”
has the boots in which Sayers fought Heenan, with the Farnborough
grass and earth attaching to the spikes, just as the great gladiator left
them.</p>

<p>Those who remember the personal appearance of the departed Champion
will have his bronzed, square, and good-humoured, lion-like phiz in their
mind’s eye; those who did not see him in the flesh must imagine a round,
broad, but not particularly thick-set man, standing 5 feet 8½ inches in his
stocking-feet, with finely turned hips, and small but powerful and flat loins,
remarkably round ribs and girth, and square shoulders. His arms were of
medium length, and so round as not to show prominently the biceps, or
<a name="Page_438" id="Page_438"></a><span class="pageno">438</span>
even the outer muscles of the fore-arm, to the extent often seen in men of
far inferior powers of hitting and general strength. Indeed, the bulk of
Sayers was so compactly packed that you did not realise his true size and
weight at a cursory glance, and it was this close and neat packing of his
trunk&mdash;&#8203;excuse the pun&mdash;&#8203;that doubtless was an important ingredient in
many a “long day” in which Tom’s lasting powers were the admiration of
every spectator. Tom’s head was certainly of the “bullet” shape, and it
was supported by a neck of the sort known as “bull,” conveying the idea
of enduring strength and determination to back it. We have no phrenological
examination of Tom’s “bumps” before us, but we doubt not those
of combativeness and amativeness were fully developed. Tom’s fighting
weight began at 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>; in his later battles it was 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> to 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>
12<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> The photographs which figure in the print-shop windows do not
convey a fair idea of Tom’s good-tempered and often merry expression: he
seems to have been taken when filled with the contemplation of the seriousness
of the position of having one’s “counterfeit presentment” multiplied
and sent forth to the world. From the hips downward Tom was not a
“model man.” Though round in the calf, his thighs were decidedly deficient
in muscular development; yet no man made better use of his pins in
getting in and out again, as witness his <em>up</em>-hill performances with the six-foot
Slasher, and the ponderous and more active Benicia Boy. It was to
Tom’s excellent judgment of time and distance that the severity of his
hitting was due, and to his mighty heart&mdash;&#8203;a bigger never found place in
man’s bosom&mdash;&#8203;that his triumphant finish of many a well-fought day is to
be attributed. No man ever fought more faithfully to his friends or bravely
with his foes in “the battle of life;” and therefore is the tribute of a record
of his deeds due to <span class="sc">Tom Sayers</span>.</p>

<p>His remains were consigned to their parent earth, on Wednesday,
November 15th, 1866, at the Highgate Cemetery, attended by an immense
concourse of the sympathising and curious. A committee of friends, the
admirers of true British courage, raised a monument over the spot
where&mdash;</p>

<p class="center smaller">“After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well.”</p>

<p>Of this monument we present a faithful delineation.</p>

<p>It would be an unpardonable omission were we to conclude the biography
of Tom Sayers without appending the remarkable poem, attributed to the
pen of William Makepeace Thackeray, which appeared in <cite>Punch</cite>, April
28th, 1860. We need hardly say that it is a paraphrase rather than a
parody of Lord Macaulay’s legend of “Horatius” in the “Lays of Ancient
Rome.”</p>

 There were numerous pictorial representations of the battle both in England and
America; some of them amusingly imaginative. The large, coloured engraving, published
by Newbold, and its smaller American piracy, are faithful as to the men and the field of
action. The object in view in these pictures&mdash;&#8203;that of giving recognisable portraits of most
of the pugilistic, and many of the sporting, and a few of the literary notabilities of the day,
of course destroys all truthfulness or reality of grouping, as in so many works professing
to represent great battles, festivals, or public commemorations. Our frontispiece, from a
contemporary sketch, is less pretentious, and therefore more realistic and truthful.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">JEM MACE, OF NORWICH (CHAMPION).<br />
1855&ndash;1864.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">None</span> who have witnessed the public appearances of this accomplished
boxer will dispute that he was one of the cleverest, smartest, and most
skilful pugilists that have sported buff in the 24-foot. Indeed, had Jem
appeared at an earlier and better period than the latter days of the failing
and moribund <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>; and (another <em>if</em>) had he chosen honestly and manfully
to exert his powers, the fame that accompanies the championships of the
two elder Jems&mdash;&#8203;Jem Belcher and Jem Ward&mdash;&#8203;might have shone on the
career of Jem Mace. As we have already more than once said, such as
the patrons of the Ring (or, indeed, of the turf and any other sport) are,
such will the character of its professors or exponents be. If horse owners
are mere mercenary speculators, can we expect jockeys to go straight?
When the patronage of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> had fallen from noblemen, gentlemen,
and the admirers of courage and fair-play into the hands of the keepers of
night houses, “hells,” and even resorts yet more detestable, whose sole
object was to fleece the dissipated and unwary by the sale of high-priced
railway passes for “special excursions,” and bring customers and victims to
their dens of debauchery and robbery, could it be expected that
boxers would remain honest and brave? The encouragement of bravery and
skill being as nothing to these debased speculators. This, we regret to say,
was the degradation into which the Ring had fallen, or was fast falling, when
Jem Mace first became known as a boxer, and to these influences some of
the “shady” incidents of his career are easily traceable.</p>

 <p class="caption">JEM MACE, <span class="sc">of Norwich (Champion)</span> 1855&ndash;1864.</p>
</div>

<p>Jem, who was born at Beeston, near Swaffham, in Norfolk,
made his first appearance on the stage of life in May, 1831, and,
like <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick, “came of dacent people.” His “forebears,” as transpired
incidentally in evidence at the Commission <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">de lunatico inquirendo</span> known as
<a name="Page_445" id="Page_445"></a><span class="pageno">445</span>
“The great Windham scandal,” which was tried at Gray’s Inn, in 1861,
seem to have been tenants on the Windham estates for more than a
hundred years. We have mentioned this fact, as a general impression prevailed,
from Jem’s nomadic antecedents and propensities, that he was a born
Bohemian; indeed, we more than once read in newspapers that he was of
gipsy extraction. Of Jem’s youth we know nothing, except that he
“growed,” like Topsy, and we should say rather wild; for when we first
heard of him he was proprietor of a travelling booth, wherein, at fairs,
races, and public gatherings he not only played the violin&mdash;&#8203;on which he is
a tolerable performer&mdash;&#8203;and supplied refreshments, but was acknowledged
as a skilful professor of the art of self-defence. Indeed, he had not long
been in this line of business before Jem Mace’s booth was the resort of
numerous admirers of glove-practice, and Jem himself was famed for his
readiness and success in polishing off any aspiring yokel who might desire
to try a bout with the mittens. As Jem’s youthful weight did not quite
balance ten stone he was of course often “overweighted,” though never
overmatched in these encounters, and as he was always ready “to accommodate”
without regard to size or avoirdupois, Jem’s early career taught
him how to deal with “big ones,” as his after-fights with Tom King and
the gigantic Sam Hurst bear witness.</p>

<p>Jem was not a precocious pugilist, having attained his twenty-fourth
year before engaging himself to strip with a local boxer, bearing the formidable
name of Slack, in October, 1855. Of this “illustrious obscure”
we need only say that <cite>Fistiana</cite> has but one line chronicling his defeat by
one Jack Baston (fighting as Mace’s Novice) in September, 1857, when
Slack broke his arm. Mace’s fight with Slack, which took place at Mildenhall,
October 2, 1855, was a one-sided affair, Jem snuffing out his adversary’s
pretensions in nineteen minutes, which included the 9th and last
round, and leaving off without a mark of punishment. From this time, for
more than a year, Jem pursued the even tenor of his way, increasing
his fame as a fistic practitioner and professor, when the rumour of his “gift”
of hitting reached the great metropolis, and with it came an announcement
that Mace would be happy, upon finding a suitable customer, to exhibit his
talents in the London Ring with any 10 stone practitioner, and give a few
pounds.</p>

<p>Bill Thorpe, a fine made and well-proportioned 10 stone man, standing
about 5 feet 9 inches in his stocking-feet, had crept into favour with some
“over-the-water” sporting circles by his defeat of a man named Bromley,
<a name="Page_446" id="Page_446"></a><span class="pageno">446</span>
in the same ring in which Dan Collins (Sayers’s early opponent) beat Patsy
Daly, on September 28, 1856. Thorpe, being on the look-out for a job,
was considered a fit match for Jem Mace, and his friends placing him in the
hands of Dan Dismore, the articles were drawn and signed to fight on the
17th February, 1857, for £50, neither man to exceed 10 stone. This
limitation of weight suggests a rather curious reflection as to the remarkable
manner in which some modern pugilists may be said to have
increased in weight by “leaps and bounds.” Jemmy Massey, who fought
at 8<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, could not latterly scale under 10 stone. Sayers increased
from 9<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> to 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 12<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, yet he was twenty-four years old when he
fought Dan Collins; Harry Broome in two years grew from 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> to 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>;
he, however, began unusually young, while Jem Mace, who was twenty-six
when he first appeared in the London ring, increased from 9<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>
to 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> just as Tom Sayers did. The affair came off, after a shift
from the Kentish marshes, on Canvey Island, and although the men were
termed novices, there was a better muster than usual of the patrons of the
ring, owing to the popularity of Dan Dismore and Keene, who severally
backed the men. The weather was genial and more like a May day than
February, and a pleasant voyage was followed by an easy debarkation, and
well-kept ring. Thorpe first threw in his hat, esquired by Jemmy Welsh
and Tom Sayers&mdash;&#8203;the appearance of the latter bearing testimony to the
wonderful strength of his constitution, one week only having elapsed since
his renewed and tremendous battle with Aaron Jones! Mace was not long
in following Thorpe’s example, being accompanied by the accomplished
Bill Hayes and a Norwich amateur. At three o’clock, all being in apple-pie
order, the men and seconds crossed hands, and the former were left
face to face to begin</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;As Mace threw himself into
attitude there was a general expression of
admiration among the best qualified judges
at the style of “the countryman,” and
the easy grace with which he moved in and
out, as if measuring his opponent, without
the least hurry or nervousness. Thorpe,
who, as we have already said, is a fine
straight young fellow, stood with his right
leg foremost <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</span> Bendigo, and by his steady
coolness showed he too was a practitioner in
the sparring school, and not easily to be got
at. Mace, however, filled the eye as a
longer and altogether bigger man, though
there was but three pounds difference in
their weight. Thorpe, as his opponent tried
to draw him, declined the temptation and retreated,
closely and warily followed by Mace,
who, at length seeing an opening, instantly
planted a right-hander on Thorpe’s nob with
a swiftness that completely astonished the
Londoners. Thorpe did not shrink, but tried
to cross-counter Mace’s left, when dash went
in Jem’s mauley such a spank on Thorpe’s
proboscis, that the Londoner was hit clean
off his legs, a fair and indisputable “knockdown,”
thus scoring the first event. On
being carried to his corner, Thorpe was seen
to be distilling the crimson from his olfactory
organ, and “first blood” was also awarded
to the member for Norwich. Thus early the
odds were offered on Mace, but no response
<a name="Page_447" id="Page_447"></a><span class="pageno">447</span>
was made even to an offer of 6 to 4,
followed by 2 to 1 from a Norwich speculator.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Mace lost no time in getting to work;
he lashed out his left before he was well
within distance. Thorpe retreated, but Mace
did not get near enough for a prop, and
Thorpe appeared to be confused at the
manner in which his antagonist had planted
on him in the opening bout, and was by no
means desirous to have a second dose. In
his tactics, however, he did not display
science, for he neither hit with precision nor
judgment. In his former battle with a
12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> opponent Thorpe fought with steady
resolution, but the quickness and cleverness
of Mace seemed to unnerve and puzzle him,
and he hurriedly missed both hands, while
after a little manœuvring, Mace let fly left
and right in rapid succession on the head,
and then got cleverly away. Thorpe, after
following his man up, dashed out wildly
with the right, and just missed getting home
a stinger. Mace, in returning the compliment,
again delivered a rattling spank on
the nose, when Thorpe went down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Thorpe, acting under the instruction
of his seconds, led off, but was neatly
stopped. Determined not to be denied&mdash;&#8203;Jemmy
Welsh seeing that out-fighting would
never do, urged his man to go in, and go in
he did in an impetuous manner, just reaching
Master Jem on the top part of the
cranium. In the counter-hitting, Mace had
all the best of it, and after a scrambling
kind of rally, they closed at the ropes, when
both went down, Mace rolling over his
opponent.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;The countryman administered a pretty
one-two on the front of his opponent’s nob,
who did not appear to have the least idea of
how to stop these telling visitations. In
returning the compliment, Thorpe hit out
wildly, and succeeded in getting slightly on
Jem’s brain canister. This brought the combatants
to a close, when Mace threw his
man and fell on him; the London division
looked blue at this proof of superiority at
close quarters, and the “Norwich novice”
was pronounced a “stunner,” by more than
one good judge.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;The Londoner led with the left and
right, but without precision. Mace, in the
countering, planted the left on the cheek,
and in a bustling rally fought his man to the
ropes, when Thorpe succeeded in getting
home a heavy spank with the right on the
top of the knowledge-box, and Mace slipped
and went down.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Bill, in opening the ball, tried the
right, but again missed. The London party
vociferously encouraged their man, declaring
the countryman was “half-licked.” Mace
retreated as his antagonist came dashing in;
but Thorpe was not to be denied, though, in
the exchanges that ensued, he had all the
worst of it, for Mace delivered the left and
right full on the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">os frontis</span>, when Thorpe
went down in the middle of the ring, bleeding
profusely.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;On coming up, Thorpe displayed considerable
marks of punishment, having a cut
over the left peeper, and one under the right,
a proof that his antagonist was a hard
hitter, as well as a quick and rapid fighter.
Bill again tried to take the lead, and to put
in a hot ’un on the nob with the right, but
the intended compliment was not within
the mark. Mace, as Thorpe dashed to him
for in-fighting, sent both mauleys full in the
middle of the Londoner’s dial, but, in stepping
back, slipped, and partly went down on
his knees. On the instant, however, he
recovered his equilibrium, and, after some
spirited exchanges, in favour of the
countryman, they closed, when Thorpe went
down against his will.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Thorpe was unsteady on coming up;
Mace had no sooner been met by his antagonist
than he delivered the left with telling
force right on the mark, following it up with
a one-two on the nob, and then, to avoid
his opponent’s rush, being near the ropes,
went down cunning.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;The supposed success of Thorpe in
fighting down his man in the last round led
to encouraging cheers from his partisans,
who declared the countryman was “cutting
it.” Thorpe, after leading off with little or
no effect, closed, and got home a heavy
thwack on the side of the head with the
right, when, after a little fibbing, Mace broke
ground, and went down.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Mace came from his corner with a
smiling countenance. Thorpe had all the
will to be dangerous, but lacked the judgment,
for, in commencing the attack, he was
again out of distance. Mace, when he had
worked his way well to his man, administered
the left and right once more on Master
Bill’s damaged pimple, and then, as Thorpe
rushed in for the close, went down easy.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;After two or three ineffectual attempts,
Bill went in resolutely and got home
with both mauleys on the side of the nob;
Mace, after returning the compliment, with
a slight addition by way of interest, closed
with his opponent, and both went to grass,
Thorpe under.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Thorpe with the left got home
slightly on the head, but in trying to
improve upon this he was well stopped. In
a wild rally the Londoner fought his man to
the ropes, when the countryman with both
the left and right gave him an additional
dose of punishment on the nob, drawing
another supply of claret. After these exchanges
the men closed and fell.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Thorpe, after leading off, napped a
stinger on the side of the nob, when he
immediately closed with his opponent.
Some half-arm fighting ensued, all in favour
of Mace, and both were down.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Bill, in a wild impetuous manner,
went dashing in at his man, but in the
counters did little or no execution. Mace,
<a name="Page_448" id="Page_448"></a><span class="pageno">448</span>
after steadily planting both mauleys on the
head, retreated, and in breaking ground
slipped and fell.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;The Londoner made an attempt with
the right, but was well stopped. As Mace
broke ground, Thorpe followed him up with
much gameness and resolution, and in the
exchanges delivered a tidy spank with the
left on the side of the head, when Mace
went down to avoid the close, with more
prudence than pluck.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Mace, who had been allowing his
opponent to do all the work, now saw he had
him in hand; with great quickness and precision
he let fly with both hands at the head,
and repeated the dose without a return.
Thorpe rushed at his man for the close, when
Mace went down laughing.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Thorpe met his antagonist with much
resolution, and with the right planted a
stinger on the side of the head. Mace, in
retreating, slipped and went down, but on
the instant he was again on his pins, and
renewed the battle. In the counter-hitting
he got home with telling effect, and in
retreating from his man he again slipped
and went on his knees, but instantly jumped
up and faced his opponent. Bill, though,
as usual, receiving all the punishment,
stood his ground manfully, until they closed,
when, after some little fibbing, Mace went
down.</p>

<p>     18 and last.&mdash;&#8203;Mace in this bout gave his
antagonist the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span> in the most off-hand
and masterly manner. Thorpe came
up desperate, and Jem, after stopping the
opening shots of his opponent, delivered his
left and right with stinging force on the
middle of Master Bill’s nob, the last hit with
his right being full on his nasal prominence.
This immediately sent Thorpe to grass, and
when “time” was called, it was found that
he was in no condition to renew the contest.
Hereupon Jemmy Welsh throw the sponge
up in token of defeat, the battle having
lasted twenty-seven minutes.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;There was but one opinion
among the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognoscenti</span> as to the winner&mdash;&#8203;namely,
that he was one of the best boxers
that we have seen for many a day. He is a
quick and rapid fighter, and hits with judgment,
precision, and remarkable force, as the
condition of poor Thorpe’s head strikingly
manifested. The Londoners knew by repute
that he was considered to be a good general;
but we are confident that they never for a
moment imagined that he was anything like
the man he turned out. As will be seen by
our description of the rounds, he fights
remarkably well, and when in danger has
the ability to get out of it in clever style.
From first to last he had the battle entirely
in his own hands, Thorpe never having the
remotest chance of winning, for he was out-fought
and out-manœuvred in every round.
Mace at the weight is a strong-made, powerful
man, and if his pluck and bottom are in
any way equal to his other qualifications, we
can only say that it will require an opponent
of first-rate ability to beat him. This tournament,
however, is by no means a fair
criterion of those qualities, for he had the
fortune and skill to get in no way punished,
absolutely winning the contest without so
much as a black eye. Thorpe, the unfortunate
loser, is, there can be no doubt, a very
game man, but he will never be able to
obtain a front position in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> It must,
however, be borne in mind that, as a game
and determined fellow, he did his best, and
it is to be hoped that he will not be forgotten
either by his friends or by the winners.
All being over, the company returned to the
metropolis, which was reached before seven
o’clock in the evening.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>The money was given to Mace, at Mr. G. Smith’s, King Street, Norwich,
on the following Thursday, when several matches were talked of, but
nothing came of them. After a sparring tour, we find our hero in London,
making Nat Langham’s his headquarters, and offering to do battle either
with Mike Madden or Bob Brettle, of Birmingham, at 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 3<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, for
£100 a side. He was also “nibbled at” by Job Cobley (nicknamed by
Baron Nicholson “the Elastic Potboy”) whose victories over Webb, Bob
Travers (the black), and George Crockett, had brought him into the front
rank of middle-weights; Cobley’s engagement with Mace going off, owing
to the former being matched against Bob Brettle. Some pourparlers with
Jack Grant also ended in talk, until, early in the month of September,
Mace having left a deposit in the hands of the Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, Mike
<a name="Page_449" id="Page_449"></a><span class="pageno">449</span>
Madden covered the same, and articles were signed for a fight for £50, to
come off in the Home Circuit, on the 20th of October, 1857.</p>

<p>Mace was now in business as a publican, keeping the Swan Inn, Swan
Lane, Norwich; and at the final deposit at Nat Langham’s on the previous
Thursday we heard an ominous whisper to the effect that there would be
“no fight;” while, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">per contra</span>, we were assured by both parties that each
meant fighting and nothing else. On the Friday Mr. Lockwood, of Drury
Lane, on the part of Madden, and Langham, on the part of Mace, attended
at the Editor’s Office, and were there informed, as that gentleman could not
be present, he should exercise the power vested in the stakeholder by the
articles of naming the referee, and further that he should appoint Dan
Dismore to that office, to which neither of the parties made the slightest
objection. On the Monday the men went to scale at Mr. Lockwood’s, and
here there were loud complaints on the part of Mace’s friends about Madden’s
style of weighing, they stating him to be overweight, also that he jumped
off the scale before the balance was fairly ascertained, and, putting on his
clothes, refused to return. On the other hand Madden and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> averred
that Mace never meant fighting, that after the weighing he went out of
the house in his shirt sleeves, and did all in his power to attract the attention
of the police; and that in the evening he went to Gravesend, where he
ostentatiously paraded himself, and even proclaimed the whereabouts of
the coming mill.</p>

<p>On the Tuesday morning, on reaching the ground, we found
an excellent ring, which was quickly surrounded by a large number
of Corinthians and other Ring patrons, prepared to witness what many
expected&mdash;&#8203;a real good battle. To their disappointment and surprise, however,
when all other preliminaries were arranged, Mace and his friends
stepped forward, and formally objected to Dan Dismore as referee, on the
ground that he had money on the fight. Dan instantly replied that he had
not a shilling on the result, and that he should not have been present had
he not received the letter appointing him referee. Mace’s party persisted
in their objection, and various propositions were made, among others one
by Mike Madden himself, who said he was willing to fight with two
umpires and without any referee; but to this Mace objected, as “contrary
to the articles.” Several gentlemen were proposed for the onerous and
thankless office, who either declined or were objected to; so at last what
was to have been the second fight (between Clamp and Gibbs) was got off
amidst disgraceful confusion, Clamp proving himself the best man in one
<a name="Page_450" id="Page_450"></a><span class="pageno">450</span>
hour and thirty minutes. Both Madden and Mace remained in or at
the side of the ring while the men were fighting, and after some more discussion
of the vexed question of a referee, all returned to London. On
the Wednesday, after a patient hearing of both sides, the stakeholder
declared that Mace having refused to go to the scratch, when called upon
by the duly-appointed referee, had thereby deliberately violated the articles
and forfeited the stake, £100, which in due course was handed over to
Madden. An unusual amount of irrelevant correspondence, statements as
to shares of stake-money, training expenses, unpaid bets, promises and
defalcations, from Mace, Madden, and Messrs. Lockwood, Hayes, Dismore,
Keene, <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> followed. Finally, after six months’ quibbling, a new match
was agreed on, and the 10th of March, 1858, named as the day of battle.</p>

<p>Well do we remember the early muster on that spring morning at the
Eastern Counties Railway terminus at Shoreditch. There was “old Mike,”
whose deafness, solidity, and stolid look had already earned him the prefix
of “old,” though he numbered but thirty summers; he was buttoned up to the
chin, in an old-fashioned drab box-coat, with a deep-red neckerchief, and a
sealskin cap, the ears of which completely covered his ears and cheeks.
He was anxiously inquiring of the group around for his “friend the enemy,”
as the time for starting was near. We entered the station. Could it be
true? We had the word of the traffic station-master for it. After a brief
conversation on the platform, in which some “d&mdash;&#8203;d kind friend” inopportunely
alluded to the lamentable result of “ould Mike’s” last battle&mdash;&#8203;that
with Jack Jones, of Portsmouth&mdash;&#8203;Jem, with a nod of the head and a
cheerful expression, left his friends, and seating himself in an Ipswich
carriage just about to steam out of the station, coolly waved a “good-bye”
to the astonished group! Another account states, that after Madden and
<abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> had gone down by the appointed train, Mace was found in a neighbouring
coffee-house, whither he had taken refuge from an impending arrest
by the police! It is not of much consequence which is the correct version,
as the claim of Madden to forfeit from the absence of his opponent was
made and fully admitted.</p>

<p>That the pugilistic qualifications and cleverness of Mace were still
believed in by some of the best judges of boxing is shown by the fact that
“George Brown’s novice,” as Jem was now called, was thought good enough
to back against Bob Brettle of Birmingham, whose conquests of Roger
Coyne, Sam Simmonds, and Bob Travers were then fresh in the memory of
Ring-goers. George Brown, Billy Richardson, and Jack Macdonald were
<a name="Page_451" id="Page_451"></a><span class="pageno">451</span>
sponsors, and these knowing ones declared that the 21st September, 1858,
would show “the coming champion.” Nevertheless, serious misgivings
haunted the public mind, not only when the last deposit of the £200 stakes
was “tabled,” but even on the short railway journey which preceded the
voyage per steamer to Shell Haven, odds being taken that there would be
“no fight that day.” Great, therefore, was the satisfaction when it was
found that Mace was on board the boat, not only well but cheerful, and
apparently confident. After a pleasant run down the river, a fitting spot
was selected on the banks of the Medway, where Tom Oliver and his
assistants pitched an excellent ring on a lovely piece of greensward.</p>

<p>The Champion of the Midlands was first to cast his beaver into the
ropes, amidst hearty cheering, Alec. Keene and Jem Hodgkiss attending
as his esquires. Mace soon after showed, advised by Jack Macdonald and
Jemmy Massey. It wanted ten minutes to twelve when the men shook
hands, the seconds retired to their corners, and the men threw themselves
into position for</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>     Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;There was very little time
lost in manœuvring, both men surprising
their friends by an almost nervous eagerness
to get at it. Mace at once made play,
and let go both hands in the style that had
so disconcerted Thorpe; Brettle, however,
making a good stop or two, and returning
wildly, getting two or three severe cracks,
one on the ear so specially heavy that the
blood appeared from his auricular organ,
and the first event was scored to Mace.
After a short rally Brettle closed; Mace hit
up sharply, but Bob got the crook and fell
over him. The friends of Mace thought
their man meant fighting, and the odds
which had been offered&mdash;&#8203;5 and 6 to 4 on
Brettle&mdash;&#8203;subsided to evens.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;The men threw themselves into good
form; Brettle tried to lead off with the left,
but was stopped neatly, and after another
offer and a shift, Jem landed his right
smartly on Brettle’s left ear. Again there was
a stop or two, and Mace got home slightly;
Brettle retreated, and measuring his man as
he came in, let go his right on the left side
of Mace’s head, on the temple; down went
the Norwich man, and the round was over.
Alec Keene claimed “first knock-down” for
Brettle, and the referee awarded it. Mace
was picked up by his attentive seconds,
when a strange commotion was seen in his
corner; he glared round for a few seconds,
then suddenly swooned in Jack Macdonald’s
arms. Mac and Massey shook him, and
the latter bringing a stool into the ring,
tried to seat him thereon. In vain: his legs
fell about like Mr. Punch’s, or the nether
limbs of a <span class="lang" lang="it" xml:lang="it">fantocchino</span>, and his toes determinedly
found their way under the ropes.
The syncope was so determined that the
Brums began to roar and jeer, and the Eastenders
to swear; when the enraged Mac
administered such a vice-like pinch to his
man’s ear, that he roared lustily, but the
next moment was as insensible as ever
to all outward things. “Time” was
now called, and “Time!” was repeated
by the referee. Jem was set up in a
perpendicular position, but those recalcitrant
legs sent up their heels, and Jem would have
assumed a devotional attitude, but that the
“stunted lifeguardsman” held him up by
main strength, while his head fell sideways
on Macdonald’s shoulder. “Time!” the
eight seconds’ “grace” were counted.
“There are none so deaf as those that
won’t hear,” was once more verified, and
Bob Brettle was declared the conqueror,
the actual fight having lasted <em>three minutes</em>.
On the boat it was observed that Brettle’s
last hit had raised a very blue mouse on Jem’s
cheek-bone, but that it had knocked him
out of time&mdash;&#8203;<span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">credat Judæus Apella</span>&mdash;&#8203;indeed
we are sure no Sheeny from Houndsditch
would believe it.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>The elation of Brettle’s friends at this victory led them into a mistake.
<a name="Page_452" id="Page_452"></a><span class="pageno">452</span>
They matched their man against Tom Sayers, and on September 20th,
1859, in a short quarter of an hour, seven rounds disposed of the Brum’s
pretensions, as may be fully read in our last chapter.</p>

<p>Mace’s next match remains a yet-unexplained riddle. He was backed
on this occasion by Bob Brettle&mdash;&#8203;the man who had defeated him with such
apparent ease&mdash;&#8203;against one of his own townsmen, Posh Price, at 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>
10<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, for £50 a side. Price was a boxer of proved game and no mean
capabilities. The deposits were posted by Brettle in the name and on the
behalf of a man called in the articles “Brettle’s Novice,” and it was not
until the last deposit that it was declared that Jem Mace was the “Novice”
thus described.</p>

<p>On the 25th of January, 1859, after the gallant battle between Dan
Thomas (the Welshman) and Charles Lynch (the American), in which the
former was victorious, a special train having conveyed the spectators and
combatants from London Bridge to Aldershot Common, the ring was
cleared and re-formed by Fred Oliver and his assistants. No sooner,
however, had the ropes been tightened, and the stakes driven firm, than, to
the chagrin of the expectant assemblage, a detachment of the rural constabulary
made their appearance, and a move into the adjacent county of
Surrey became imperative. The transit was quickly and safely effected,
and no sooner was the ring adjusted, than “Brettle’s Novice,” attended by
his backers, tossed his cap into the ropes in token of defiance, and stood
revealed to all as Jem Mace of Norwich. His condition and bearing not
even the most prejudiced could find fault with. The men went to scale on
the previous day at George Brown’s, “The Bell,” Red Lion Market, both
being well within the 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> Posh Price, who was born in 1832, and
won his first victory in the Ring at eighteen years of age, was as yet unbeaten.
He had successively defeated Mush, Boucher, Leighton, Benson,
Holland, Liddy, and lastly the once renowned Ben Terry, who fought a
draw with Harry Broome. In all these battles he had borne himself
bravely, and showed no mean amount of skill. It was not, therefore, to be
wondered at that Price was favourite in the betting at 5 and 6 to 4. The
Birmingham man was seconded by Sam Simmonds and Joe Wareham, while
Mace had behind him Jem Hodgkiss and Brettle. Price, whose age was
twenty-seven&mdash;&#8203;Mace being one year older&mdash;&#8203;was all his friends could desire
in point of condition, and his hardy, good-natured mug wore a smile of
confidence in the result of
</p>
<a name="Page_453" id="Page_453"></a><span class="pageno">453</span>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;On the retirement of their
seconds the belligerents at once threw themselves
into attitude, the superior freedom
of Mace’s style being quite evident to the
initiated. He played round his man, watching
him keenly; Price looking somewhat
puzzled how to begin. Presently Posh
broke ground, and retreated, keeping a good
guard; Mace followed his man closely, and,
getting well within distance, popped in his
left on Price’s mazzard, but was countered
by Price’s left on the forehead. Mace stuck
to his work, and caught Price right and left
in the head. Posh fought determinedly in
the exchanges, but Mace drove him back,
planting the left on Price’s right eye with
such severity that the ruby streamed
down his cheek. (First blood for Mace.)
After a break and a little wincing they
again got within striking distance, when
some heavy exchanges ended in Price being
on the grass.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;The men went at once to work, and
some slashing exchanges followed, in which
Mace, partly from a hit, and partly from a
slip, was down. In an instant he was on
his feet again, and as the Brum, somewhat
surprised, retreated before him, followed
him close. Near the ropes Posh made a
stand, and hit out with both hands. After
some fine two-handed fighting in favour of
Mace, Price was on the ground, Mace walking
smilingly to his corner.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Mace forced the fighting. He led off
with astonishing rapidity, doing terrible
damage to the Brum’s dial and cranium.
Posh stood to his guns like a man, but
Mace’s metal was too heavy for him.
Nevertheless, in the exchanges, Price got in
a hot ’un on Mace’s jaw, and another on his
neck, that made Master Jem look serious,
and although the odds had changed, the
Brums took heart from the general opinion
of Mace’s deficiency of game. In the close
both were down at the ropes.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Mace led off rather short, and as he
got nearer Price planted his left in the
middle of his opponent’s nob. (Tremendous
cheering from the Brums). Mace
drew himself together, and fighting rapidly,
got heavily on Posh’s eye and mouth. The
gallant Brum paused a moment, then dashed
in, and after a magnificent rally, in which
Mace astonished the spectators by the
straightness and rapidity of his hitting,
Price went down against his will.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Jem lunged out his left, delivering an
enlivener on his adversary’s brain pan, and
getting cleverly away from the Brum’s returns.
After a little sparring, Mace got
again within distance, and in some clipping
left-handed exchanges got with tell-tale
force on the Brum’s dial. Posh, scorning
to retreat, stood his ground, and fought up.
In the fall both were down, Price undermost.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Mace opened the ball with a shot from
the left, when the Brum retreated. Jem
followed, and again got in the left with
telling effect. They closed at the ropes,
when Posh, who was catching pepper, got
down.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Heavy counters, each doing execution
on the head. As Price retreated, Mace
followed, and as the Brum turned on nearing
the ropes, Mace caught him a terrific
right-hander on the head, just behind the
ear, opening a cut from which the carmine
ran copiously; Posh, who appeared dazed
by the effect of this rasper, went down on
his knees in the middle of the ring.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Price came up slowly but steadily;
in an instant Mace dashed in with electric
rapidity, right and left, in his opponent’s
damaged frontispiece; Price was, however,
by no means idle, and stuck to Mace in the
counter-hitting. In a rally Posh was
down.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Mace came with alacrity from his
corner; he was almost unmarked, while
poor Posh’s countenance was out of shape
in every feature. Still he kept his form&mdash;&#8203;such
as it was&mdash;&#8203;and tried to stop his man,
too often ineffectually. Mace drove him to
the ropes, and would have screwed him up
for fibbing, but Posh slipped down through
his hands.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Posh made a desperate attempt to
lead off, but Mace stopped him artistically,
and caught him a smasher on the proboscis
for his temerity; Posh in turn retreated,
when Mace followed him. Price, to avoid
a heavy right-hander, ducked his head,
and in doing so caught his foot in the grass
and fell.</p>

<p>     11th and last.&mdash;&#8203;The combatants came up
readily. The Brum seemed determined
upon a last effort to stem the tide, and the
Norwich man at once accepted the attack.
The exchanges were effective and sharp,
and while the men were thus fighting, Mace
hit his man a terrific blow on the left arm,
which caused Price to drop his hand, and
stagger to his corner. A swelling on the
fore arm was instantly visible, and it was
stated that the small bone of the limb was
fractured. Sam Simmonds stepped forward
and declared that his man was disabled,
and he would not permit the game fellow
(who had risen to his feet to renew the contest)
to fight any longer. The sponge was
accordingly thrown up, and Mace hailed
the winner, the battle having lasted exactly
17 minutes.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;We do not remember to have
seen such severe and cutting punishment
administered in so short a time in any battle
of modern times. Mace, in this contest, not
only justified the high opinion of his scientific
quality which we always entertained,
but displayed a steady resolution for which
none had given him credit. True, he was
<a name="Page_454" id="Page_454"></a><span class="pageno">454</span>
never in danger of losing the fight, and as
round succeeded round his superiority
became more manifest. He fought throughout
with wonderful quickness; and that his
hitting was as hard as it was precise poor
Posh’s battered mug and bruised carcase
fully testified. Of the gallant Brum, we can
only say he was out-classed, out-generalled,
stopped, foiled, and punished at all points;
and, as he did all that became a man, he
deserves the respect of all who admire
pluck and resolution; and it should not be
forgotten that at last his defeat was due to
an unfortunate and disabling accident, not
to a surrender. The £100 was given over
to Mace on the Tuesday following, at Bob
Brettle’s “White Lion,” Digbeth.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Mace was now a publican, hanging out his sign at the Swan Inn, Swan
Lane, Norwich, and exhibiting his talents almost nightly at the “Baronial
Hall,” West End, Norwich. In the early months of 1859 we read, “Jem
Mace, wishing to try his hand once again in the London <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, will fight any
man at 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, in four months from the first deposit, for £100.” This
was answered by Job Cobley; but for a time the friends of the “Elastic
Potboy” hung back, and George Crockett offered himself at 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> This
weight was simply preposterous as a limit for Mace. Dan Collins, too,
Sayers’s first opponent, proposed; but, doubtless fortunately for himself
and friends, the match went off upon a question of amount of stakes.</p>

<p>At length in November, 1859, Bob Travers (then known as “Langham’s
Black”) responded to Mace’s cartel, and articles were drawn to fight on
the 21st of February, 1860, for £100 a side.</p>

<p>The character and antecedents of Travers left no doubt in the minds of
the patrons of pugilism that Massa Bob would fully test the stuff of which
Jem Mace was really composed. With the exception of a solitary defeat
by Job Cobley, Travers’s reputation had been well won. In his first battle,
October 29th, 1855, he beat Geo. Baker, in two rings (after an adjournment
from October 19th) in twenty-three minutes, for £25 a side, at
Tilbury. In February, 1856, he conquered Jesse Hatton, at Combe Bottom,
in 76 minutes, during which 39 hard rounds were fought. George Crockett
succumbed to his arm at Egham, in 37 rounds, occupying 114 minutes, on
May 13 in the same year, in which also (he was fighting too often) he
suffered his first defeat by Job Cobley, after a tremendous battle of 3 hours
and 27 minutes, in which 110 rounds were fought. In January, 1857, he
beat Cleghorn for £100 a side, on the Medway, in 36 rounds, 87 minutes,
and in May 13th of the same year defeated the accomplished Bill
Hayes, in 3¾ hours (!), the stakes being £100 a side. Beaten by Bob
Brettle (Travers fell without a blow), January 27, 1858, he received
a forfeit of £90 from Johnny Walker, who did not show, on the 25th May,
1858; and in April, 1859, beat the game and unflinching Mike Madden in
<a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a><span class="pageno">455</span>
45 rounds, 97 minutes, at Ashford, Kent; and this brings us to his present
engagement.</p>

<p>With such a deed-roll Travers’s chance was booked as a certainty by the
circle at the “Cambrian,” where Massa Ebony was a “bright, particular
star,” especially as many persisted in asserting the visible “white feather”
in Mace’s plumage.</p>

<p>The men injudiciously delayed their departure from town until nine
o’clock, and after a long journey by rail much time was lost before the
excursionists got on board the “City of Rochester” steamer. John
Heenan, the Benicia Boy, was among the voyagers, attended by Jack
Macdonald, and was, as may be imagined, “the observed of all observers.”
After a long water trip a debarkation was attempted in Essex, on an oft-visited
spot, and there the ring was pitched, and all in readiness, when the
police came in sight, and all were compelled to go on board again. After
another steam trip of five miles a landing was effected in Kent. Travers,
who won the toss for choice of corners, had for seconds Jerry Noon, and, to
the mystification of many, Jem’s whilom patron Bob Brettle, with whom a
feud had arisen. Bos Tyler and Jack Hicks attended upon Mace. Travers
at the opening was an immense favourite, 2 to 1 being offered on him. It
was five minutes to five o’clock when the men’s toilettes were completed
and they stood up for</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;As they faced each other
there could be no doubt that the condition
of the combatants was faultless. Travers’s
skin shone with an unmistakable lustre,
resembling a dark piece of fine old Spanish
mahogany. His massive and deep chest
and broad lines displayed a grand development
of muscularity, denoting the possession
of exceptional strength. The only
circumstance that detracted from his general
appearance was his legs, and the looseness
with which, like most niggers, he was
put together. He looked all over smiles
and grins, and as if perfectly confident he
must be the winner. Mace, possessing the
superiority in height and reach, with his
keen eye, symmetrical frame, and graceful
freedom of attitude, looked from head to
foot an athlete to whom, if the heart were
there, anything might be possible. His
friends declared that he had “screwed his
courage to the sticking place, and could not
fail,” and the event proved their trust to be
well grounded. Travers, after a little manœuvring
round the ring, tried to lead off with
the left, but was short. Mace was awake, and
as Bob jumped back, Mace followed him,
and Bob again hitting out, Mace nailed him
with the left on the cheek, and then with
the right on the left peeper. In the close,
after a smart dose of fibbing, they struggled
for the fall, when Mace threw Bob, but not
cleverly. There was an attempt to claim
first blood for Mace, but it was not admitted.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;The ice being fairly broken, the men
were no sooner up than at it. Bob again
led off, out of distance, with the left, then
retreated with rapidity; Mace followed him
up, and some sharp exchanges followed;
the Black getting home on Jem’s mouth,
while Mace was home with both hands on
the Woolly-one’s nob. In shifting position,
Travers got with his back on the ropes and
rolled down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Both men came eagerly from their
corners, and at once sparred for an opening.
The Black, who was as lively as a young
kangaroo, hopped about the ring; Mace
kept to him, so at last, after hitting out
without effect, Travers got down. (Disapprobation.)</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;The combatants came up smiling.
As yet there had been little harm done
<a name="Page_456" id="Page_456"></a><span class="pageno">456</span>
Travers, as usual, opened the ball, planting
the right on the body; in return, Mace
timed his man with fine precision, landing
both left and right effectively, the latter on
the point of the chin, when the Black went
down on his hands and knees.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;After manœuvring and breaking
ground, the men got to the ropes in Travers’s
corner; the Black, after slight exchanges,
getting down cunning. (There
was an appeal of “foul,” which the referee
disallowed, saying “Go on.”)</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;As the Darkey, in somewhat ungainly
fashion, was dancing about the ring, Mace
went to him, and at the ropes planted both
mauleys on the head with rattling precision.
In the close Travers had his back on the
ropes, when Mace tried to put on the hug;
Travers got down.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>There was here a general cry of “Police!” and a posse of these
unwelcome intruders came to the ropes, when Bob, in his anxiety to “make
tracks,” nearly ran into the arms of the Philistines. Jerry Noon had also
a narrow squeak for it, and had he not jumped into the river and swum to
a boat, he would certainly have been nailed, as the Bobby who had singled
him out did not give up the chase until up to his middle in water. The
escape so pleased several of the lookers-on who had reached the steamer
in boats safely, that a subscription was made to “dry Jerry’s clothes,” and
liberally presented to him when on board. The battle thus interrupted
had lasted 21 minutes, and as darkness would soon come on, the steamer’s
prow was directed homewards, and the referee ordered a meeting for the
next day.</p>

<p>At an early hour on Wednesday morning, the men and their backers
were on board, and at a few minutes after nine Fred Oliver announced all
to be in readiness. Mace was first to throw his castor in the ring, which
action was immediately followed by Travers, who entered with the same
grin of nonchalance as on the preceding day. Mace had scarcely a visible
mark, while the black’s ebony complexion concealed all but a cut over the
left eyebrow. A rumour was spread that Mace’s left arm was partially
disabled; but this proved a <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canard</span>, no doubt flown to influence the betting,
the Black still being backed at 2 to 1. The seconds were the same
as on the first day.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE RENEWED FIGHT.</p>

<p>  Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Just before the commencement
of hostilities, Travers proposed to back
himself to any amount at evens, and produced
a roll of notes about as thick as the
steamer’s shore-rope for that purpose; but
Mace politely declined, regretting that his
exchequer was not so flourishing as to permit
him to indulge in such speculation.
Travers, in taking the initiative, broke
ground with more haste than judgment.
Jem again followed him, got home with
both hands, and, after a close at the ropes,
the Black slipped down anyhow.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;After a little sparring Mace got home
beautifully on Bob’s black-letter title-page,
when Travers retreated, hitting out wildly.
Mace counter-manœuvred and followed,
when Bob paused a moment, then rushed in
hand-over-hand, but did not get home. Mace
planted his left with fine judgment, following
it with a job from the right; there was a little
fibbing in the close, and both down by the
ropes.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Travers again led with the left, the
blow alighting on Mace’s breast, when Mace
caught him on the side of the head. Bob
<a name="Page_457" id="Page_457"></a><span class="pageno">457</span>
retreated, and went down to avoid. (Bos
Tyler here appealed to the referee, who declined
to notice the get down. “Go on.”)</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;The Black, all activity, was all over
the ring, Mace watching his gyrations keenly
and following him close up. After a little
fiddling, Mace got near enough, and planted
his left sharply, but Travers, ducking his
head at the instant, caught the blow on the
top of his impenetrable skull. The Black
tried to take a lead, but did not get home;
Mace, getting to distance, planted a sharp
left-hander in Bob’s face, who fell immediately
in the middle of the ring. (Loud cries
from Mace’s partisans of “Stand up! remember
the 13th rule!”)</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Both men went eagerly to work, Mace
got on a stinger over the left eyebrow; after
some wild exchanges, in which Jem peppered
the nigger handsomely, both were
down, Travers first to earth.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Travers dashed to in-fighting, when
Mace again propped him beautifully, and
after a scramble in the close, Bob got down
anyhow.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Travers, leading with the left, again
reached Mace’s breast, when Mace stepped
back and recovered guard. As Bob now
broke in turn Mace followed as usual, and
taking exact measure, popped in his left on
the Darkey’s thick lips; Bob again sidled
and skipped about the ring and as Jem was
letting go a straight one the Black fell, as a
bystander observed, “with the wind of the
blow.”</p>

<p>     8 to 14.&mdash;&#8203;Similar in character, and an appeal
by Hicks to the referee followed by a
“caution” to Travers from that functionary.
From the 15th to the 30th round Travers
pursued the same dropping tactics, getting
home with little effect at the opening of each
round, but unable to prevent Mace’s stinging
deliveries, from which his left eye was
now fast closing, besides other serious disfigurements.
Loud disapprobation was expressed
at the Black’s shifty tactics, and in
the 32nd round the referee got into the ring
and went to Travers’s corner to warn him of
the danger he was incurring. Bob assured
him his fall was accidental, from the state
of his shoes and the ground.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;Travers fought his man foot to foot
in a fine rally, the hitting all in favour of
Mace, and both down.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Bob tried to lead once more, but Jem
countered him beautifully, and the Black in
getting away fell.</p>

<p>     35 to 40.&mdash;&#8203;Travers at the old game again,
leading off, getting home slightly, and then
scrambling or slipping down to avoid the
consequences of standing up to his man.
That Mace was winning as fast as his opponent’s
shiftiness would allow was manifest.
In the 57th and last round, after hitting out,
the Black shifted his position, and as Mace
was delivering his blow deliberately threw
himself down. The referee now decided the
battle against him, and Mace was hailed the
victor at the end of one hour and thirty-one
minutes. A scene of disgraceful confusion
followed; Travers’s friends assailing the
referee with the foulest abuse, and refusing
to accept his decision. Travers shed tears,
and declared he was ready to fight on,
refusing to shake hands with his opponent.
Travers was severely punished; Mace’s
bruises were unimportant.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>After some acrimonious disputation and letter-writing, the referee’s
decision was properly upheld by the stakeholder, and the money handed
over to Mace at Mr. Smithers, “Golden Cross,” Charing Cross, Norwich, on
the ensuing Friday week.</p>

<p>We have already noted the fact of the disruption of friendly relations
between Mace and his quondam conqueror and subsequent friend and
patron Bob Brettle. In the early months of 1859 this ill-feeling took the
form of a challenge from Mace to Brettle, and some haggling between the
disputants on minor details and conditions. Mace’s last two exhibitions
had so far restored the much-shaken confidence of his admirers as to satisfy
them, however otherwise inexplicable his “in and out running” might
be, that, at his weight, none could “live with him,” when he really meant
“to stay.” So they listened to his solicitation to give him a second trial
“with the only man who had ever beaten him, and that by a fluke”(?). In
reply to Jem’s challenge for £100 Brettle replied that being now a “bung”
<a name="Page_458" id="Page_458"></a><span class="pageno">458</span>
in a good way of business it would not pay him to train under £200.
Holywell Lane and Club Row, and a “voice from Norwich” preferred a
bigger stake, so the prelims. were soon settled. The 19th September, 1860,
was named as the day, and Oxfordshire, as (half-way between London and
Birmingham) the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus in quo</span>. Accordingly, the London division took
their departure from Euston Square, meeting Brettle and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> at Wallingford
Road; there all alighted, and, under the pilotage of a local amateur, a
charming spot was selected. Many of the older Ring-goers, however,
expressed doubts as to the judiciousness of the selection, and foreboded an
interruption, which came all too soon. No time, therefore, was lost, and
at a few minutes before noon the men shook hands, and began.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;As the men toed the scratch
it was clear to all that they were both all
that could be wished in point of condition.
Mace had three or four pounds’ advantage
in weight, and also a trifle in height and
length. Brettle, who looked rounder, bore
a smile of self-satisfaction on his good-natured
mug, and as he swung his arms in
careless fashion, and raised his hands, he
nodded to a friend or two, as if quite
assured of the result. Brettle tried to lead
off, but Mace stopped him coolly, and tried
a return, which was prettily warded off by
Brettle, who shifted ground. Bob offered
again, but was stopped, and Jem popped in
a nose-ender in return which drew Bob’s
cork, and established a claim of “first blood
for Mace.” Bob shook his head as if
annoyed, and in he went ding-dong; the
exchanges all in favour of Mace, who hit
straightest, hardest, and oftenest. Brettle
closed, and Mace was under in the fall.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Brettle exhibited some red marks indicative
of Mace’s handiwork, while Mace
showed a mouse under the left eye. Bob
again opened the ball, but he was baffled,
and as he persevered Jem popped him
prettily on the nose, and then on the mouth,
Brettle, nevertheless, giving him a rib-bender
with the right, and on Mace retorting
on his kissing organ Bob got down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Brettle’s countenance bore increasing
marks of Mace’s skill as a face-painter, but
he lost no time in going to work; Mace
stood to him, and sharp counter-hits were
exchanged; Mace on Brettle’s left eye,
Brettle on Mace’s jaw. Exchanges and a
close; the men separated, and Mace, in
getting away, fell.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Brettle was more cautious. He
waited, and tried to draw his man. After a
little manœuvring Brettle, amidst the cheers
of the Brums, dropped on Mace’s conk a
rattler, producing the ruby. Jem looked
rather serious, and the Brums were uproariously
cheerful. Bob tried it again, but
failed, for Mace was first with him with a
smasher on the mouth. Brettle bored in,
but Mace threw him cleverly, and fell on
him.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Brettle slow, being shaken by the
blows and fall in the last round. Mace
waited for him, delivering right and left
straight as an arrow, and getting away
cleverly from the return. Bob followed
him wildly, getting more pepper; and in the
end Brettle was down in the hitting.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Brettle’s left daylight was nearly
obscured, and the right showed a distinct
mouse. His mouth too, was out of symmetry,
and his nose, naturally of the Roman
order, resembled a “flat-fish.” Notwithstanding,
he went in, and got it on the nose
and mouth, returning in a wild and ineffective
fashion, until a hot left-hander brought
him to his knees in anything but a cheerful
condition. At this point a cry of “Police,”
was followed by the appearance of a posse
of “blues,” headed by a magistrate from
Didcot. Hostilities were immediately suspended,
and all returned to the train. On
a council being held, the “manager” who
had deprecated this landing, declared that
there was now no hope of pulling up at any
part of the line; so there was nothing for it
but to order the men to meet the referee
on the following morning. “Book agen” was
the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mot d’ordre</span>, which was doubly vexatious
for the Birmingham division, who <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolens
volens</span> had to journey to London, with very
doubtful prospects of getting back their
money at the next meeting.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>After some discussion, all parties agreed to a renewal of the combat on
<a name="Page_459" id="Page_459"></a><span class="pageno">459</span>
the 20th of the month. The day proving exceptionally fine, the men and
their friends started at an early hour from Fenchurch Street, concluding
the rail part of the journey at Southend, where a couple of steam-tugs
were in waiting, and a voyage to ground on the sea-coast of Essex, never
before visited by the Fancy, was chosen. The odds on Mace were not
taken, Brettle’s friends being few, and lacking confidence. At five minutes
to one, all being in order, the men stood up.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Brettle had not entirely got
rid of the marks of the previous week’s encounter;
besides a cut under the left eye,
the right optic was “deeply, darkly,” but
not “beautifully blue,” and his face looked
somewhat puffy. Mace had no more than a
skin-deep scratch or two. No sooner had
Brettle toed the scratch, than instead of
forcing the fighting he stepped back, as if to
try whether an alteration in tactics might
change the fortune of war. Mace appeared
fora few seconds doubtful, then drawing
himself together, he slowly followed his man.
Getting closer, Brettle let fly his right, and
got home on Mace’s head, too round to be
effective, while Jem’s counterhit caught him
flush on the dial. Brettle broke ground,
Mace after him; Bob got home on Mace’s
body, but fell at the ropes in retreating.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Mace came up smiling, and was met
cheerfully by the Brum. Mace was no
sooner within distance than he made his one
two on the nose and eye, Brettle’s returns
being short and ineffective. As Bob shifted
position he slipped down on one knee, but
instantly rising renewed the battle. In the
struggle at the ropes, Mace was under, and
a “foul” was claimed, on the allegation that
Brettle had tried to “gouge” his man. The
referee said “Go on.”</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Mace came up with a slight trickle of
claret from his proboscis. Brettle’s face
looked as if Mace “had been all over it.”
Brettle fought on the retreat, but Mace was
too clever at long shots for him to take anything
by that manœuvre. As Bob broke
ground, Mace nobbed him so severely that
his head nodded like a mandarin, and on a
second visit down went Bob, staggering from
something very like a knock-down.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;The Brum came up bothered; yet he
faced his man boldly&mdash;&#8203;it was observed that
he hit with the right hand open. Mace timed
him with a straight prop and retreated.
The Brum bored in; the men got across
the ropes, when Brettle, lest Mace should
fib him, slipped down, as quickly as he
could.</p>

<p>     5th and last.&mdash;&#8203;Brettle came up quickly,
but Jem, perceiving he had got his man,
stood to him, and delivered both hands with
marvellous rapidity. Bob hit away desperately,
fighting his opponent to the ropes,
where Jem delivered two more punishers,
and Bob was down “all of a heap.” His
seconds carried him to his corner. “Time”
was called, when Mace sprang rapidly from
Johnny Walker’s knee. Brettle’s seconds
were still busy at their man, until, the given
eight seconds having expired, Jem Hodgkiss
threw up the sponge, and Mace was hailed
the conqueror; the second fight having lasted
seven minutes, the first twelve&mdash;&#8203;nineteen
minutes in all.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;These shall be as brief as
the battles. From first to last Brettle was
out-classed, over-matched, and out-fought,
Mace fully proving that once on a winning
track, at a winning pace, he was not to be
beaten.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1860, a gigantic Lancashire wrestler, 6<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> 2½<abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> in
stature, and balancing 15 stone, put forth a claim to the Championship,
and to do battle with this Goliath no better man was found than the once-hardy
Tom Paddock, now on his last legs. They met on November 5th,
1860, when poor Tom was knocked out of time by the clumsy Colossus in
the 5th round (see <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span> <a href="#Page_307"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 307</a>). With Sam Hurst&mdash;&#8203;having formed a very
low opinion of his boxing capabilities&mdash;&#8203;Jem was most anxious to try conclusions,
rightly estimating that a triumph over such a “man mountain”
<a name="Page_460" id="Page_460"></a><span class="pageno">460</span>
would dissipate any lingering doubts in the public mind of his personal
pluck and prowess.</p>

<p>Accordingly, articles were drawn for a fight for £200 a side, Waterloo
Day, the 18th of June, 1861, appointed for this interesting combat, and
a trip down the river agreed to by both parties. It was determined that,
to avoid interruption, an early start should be effected, and so well was this
arrangement carried out that at a quarter before nine o’clock the queerly-matched
pair stood facing each other in a marshy field on the river-shore,
in the centre of a well-surrounded ring; Bos Tyler and Woody being
entrusted with the care of Mace, Jem Hodgkiss and Jerry Noon nursing
the North Country “Infant.”</p>

to a hen,” was not so fully verified as might
be supposed, there being five stone difference
in their relative weights, though the discrepancy
in size was certainly remarkable.
There was another point of contrast which,
to the eye of the initiated, was fully worth
consideration in any calculation of the
chances of victory, and that was, the condition
of the men. The Norwich champion’s
compact symmetrical figure, well set-on head,
bright keen eye, and finely-developed biceps,
with tendons showing like knotted whipcord,
muscle-clothed shoulders, square bust, flat
loins and rounded hips, the whole supported
by a pair of well-turned springy-looking pedestals,
looked a model gladiator. Hurst,
on the other hand, loomed big, heavy,
clumsy, while a slight lop-sided lameness,
the result of a broken leg, which accident
had befallen him since his battle with Tom
Paddock, did not improve the naturally
ponderous slowness of his movements. His
skin, though clear, seemed loose in parts,
and the flesh looked flabby on his back and
sides. There was an ungainliness in every
movement, too, which suggested a second
edition of the Tipton Slasher, considerably
enlarged. His face, however, was tolerably
hard, and he had a look of determination
which augured well for his own opinion of
success. His friends depended much upon
the effect of any single blow he might get
in in the course of the mill, feeling a kind of
confidence that any damage he might incur
from Mace he would put up with without a
murmur, and that he certainly possessed an
amount of game which, had it been backed
by an ordinary share of the other attributes
of a pugilist, must have rendered him invincible.
On taking position Hurst at first
stood well, with his left rather low, and, if
anything, his elbow a little too close to his
side; his general attitude, however, was
good, and all fancied he had improved since
his appearance with Paddock. This, however,
lasted for a very brief period. Mace
appeared steady, serious, and cautious,
and fully aware of the difficulties he
would have to face. He sparred round his
man, in and out, feinting with all the skill
of a perfect master of the art, but for some
time did not venture near the gigantic arms
of Hurst which swung like the sails of a windmill.
At last he crept up, and after a quick
feint led off on Sam’s left eye, but not heavily.
Hurst made a chop in return, but out of
distance. Jem again crept near, feinted
then hit Sam heavily, left and right, on the
cheek and nose, without a return. Hurst,
not liking this, lumbered after his man, and
a sharp exchange followed, Mace on the
cheek and Hurst on the ribs. Mace retreated,
looking serious, walked round his
man, jobbed him swiftly on the nose, and
got away laughing. Hurst tried another
rush, and made one or two chopping hits
which Mace easily avoided and then planted
a straight right-hander on the nose, gaining
“first blood,” amidst the uproarious cheers
of his friends. Hurst still bored in, but only
to receive another smack on the left eye; he
just succeeded in reaching Jem’s lips, and
the latter fell, laughing.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Sam came up with the claret trickling
from his nose, and his left eye swollen and
discoloured; he commenced business at
once by rushing at his man, slinging out
his arms with no sort of precision. He
caught Mace on the ribs and back, close to
the shoulder, rather heavily with his right,
which made the latter look very solemn,
and caused him to retreat awhile, stopping
right and left, and avoiding close quarters.
At length he shook himself together, and
again playing round, put in a heavy hit on
the left cheek, and then got home with
great force on the nose, drawing more blood;
<a name="Page_461" id="Page_461"></a><span class="pageno">461</span>
this he followed with a straight job in the
mouth, drawing the ruby from the giant’s
lips. The spectators were astonished at
Sam’s inertness. Hurst let go both hands,
when Mace with ease stepped between his
arms, and delivered both hands with the
quickness of lightning, and with tremendous
force, upon the nose and eye. Again and
again did he do this, and then step away,
inflicting fearful punishment, and laughing
defiance at Hurst’s ungainly attempts at
retaliation. Hunt, who was clearly a mere
chopping block to Mace, seemed bewildered
by the severity of the hitting, but still persevered,
only, however, to be jobbed
heavily on the mouth, nose, and left eye,
which latter was quickly shut completely
up. Still the game fellow persevered,
until it seemed perfectly cruel to let him
go on. Mace did exactly as he liked without
a return, and at length in a close both
were down. It was a dog fall (side by side),
but it proved that Hurst’s supposed superiority
of power was destroyed, probably by
the weakness of his leg. Mace was almost
scatheless at the end of the round, while
Hurst, as may be imagined, was fearfully
punished.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Hurst, notwithstanding his injuries,
was first to the scratch, his left eye closed,
and the whole of the left side of his cheek
bruised and cut; his nose too was swollen
and bleeding. Mace, with the exception of
a slight scratch on his mouth, was little the
worse for wear. Hurst, in desperation,
immediately rushed at his man, but Jem
met him with a stinger from his right
on the nose, drawing a fresh stream, and
jumped back, covering his head completely.
Sam, furious, persevered, but the more he
swung out his arms the more did he
lay himself open to an attack. He hit
round, he sawed the air, he chopped, and,
in fact, did everything that a perfect novice
would do, but it was only to expose him to
more attacks from his artistic foe. At length
he succeeded in planting a heavy blow on
the jaw, which almost knocked Mace down,
but Jem steadied himself, and returned
desperately on Goliath’s mouth. Mace
got away, stepped quickly in again, and hit
Hurst severely in the face, left and right,
without a return. Hurst, thoroughly confused,
tried another rush, but Mace retreated
all round the ring, repeatedly jobbing
him with impunity as he lumbered
after him. At length Jem caught his foot
against a stake, and fell, but was up in an
instant, and after a feint or two got home
on Sam’s good eye twice in succession.
Hurst’s returns were ridiculously short;
in fact they were not like blows at all, and
never seemed to come from the shoulder.
At length he got a little right-hander on the
body, but received two heavy left-handed hits
in quick succession on the cheek. Sam, in
rushing in, here stepped on to Mace’s toe,
the spike in his boot entering the flesh, and
inflicting a severe wound. Jem drew back
his foot in pain, and pointed to it, but
Hurst shook his head, as if to say it was unintentional.
After Mace had inflicted a
little more punishment he slipped down;
poor Hurst, who was completely blown by
his exertions, panting like an overdriven
dray-horse, stood in the middle of the ring.
Some influential friends of Hurst’s wished
him here to give in, but his principal
backer would not bear of it.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;Jem merely showed a slight bruise
under the left arm, while Hurst was
awfully punished about the face, but was
still strong. He rushed at his man at once,
who laughed, got away, and then, after
leading him a dance, turned, and delivered
another tremendous hit on the
blind eye. Again and again did Hurst follow
him, and as repeatedly did Mace hit
him with stinging effect in every direction.
Mace at last seemed tired of his exertions,
and stood for a short time with his arms
down. Hurst also rested a little from sheer
exhaustion; at length he made another rush,
and Jem, in getting away, slipped down.
Hunt pointed at him, as much as to say it
was deliberate, but Jem was up at once,
and offered to resume the round, but
Hurst’s seconds took him away. Thirty
minutes had now elapsed.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Sam, whose face was coloured all
over, made another rush and got slightly
home on the body, when Jem again slipped
down. Once more he jumped up to renew
the round, but Sam walked away to his
corner at the call of his seconds.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Jem made the fighting, and planted
heavily on the cheek and nose, getting
quickly and easily away. Again did he do
this, and then again, hitting Hurst with
stunning force in the middle of the head
with both hands, until the poor fellow turned
away completely bewildered. Nevertheless,
he quickly rallied, and again tried his rush,
but only to get into more difficulties, until
everybody round the ring cried “Take him
away!” (Hodgkiss here appealed to his
backers to be allowed to throw up the
sponge; they refused, indeed, it was evident
that Sam himself would not yet consent
to own that he was licked.) Sam made
another rush, and after slight exchanges,
closed; a brief struggle took place, when
both fell, Hurst undermost. It was claimed
by Mace’s friends as a cross-buttock, but it
scarcely amounted to that, although Jem
certainly had the advantage in the fall.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Bob Brettle now appealed to Sam’s
backers to give in, but in vain. Bob tried
to get into the ring, and did throw up his
hat, but was forced away by Sam’s backers.
Mace offered to shake hands, and seemed
unwilling to inflict more punishment, feeling
that it was useless cruelty. Sam would
not hear of surrender, but made his rush,
and succeeded in getting home his right on
the body, when Jem fell.</p>

<p>     8th and last.&mdash;&#8203;Hurst came up staggering,
his face much disfigured; Mace also seemed
<a name="Page_462" id="Page_462"></a><span class="pageno">462</span>
rather tired. Sam made a final effort,
letting go both hands, but was short, and
received two more very straight hits on the
cheek and nose, drawing claret in fresh profusion.
Sam blundered in almost blind,
and Mace pushed, rather than hit him,
several times in the head, looking at him
steadily and stepping back after each delivery.
The “big ’un” was evidently
powerless, and Jem was commendably forbearing.
Another attempt was made by
Brettle to throw up the sponge, and the
referee stepped into the ring to remonstrate
with Sam’s principal backer, but neither he
nor Hurst would listen to reason. The consequence
was that Jem was reluctantly
compelled to hit him again, which he did
with perfect impunity; and finally Jem
Hodgkiss, finding it useless to reason with
either Sam or his backer, took the responsibility
upon himself, and threw up the
sponge, forcing the unwilling giant to his
corner, where Mace went up to him, and
shook hands, although sorely against Hurst’s
will, who could not even now reconcile to
himself his defeat by one upon whom he
looked with contempt. Mace was then
proclaimed the victor, after fighting for
<em>fifty minutes</em>. He bore his honours modestly,
and as soon as possible went round with the
hat, and collected the sum of £35 for his
unsuccessful antagonist.</p>

<p>     Scarcely was this done, when the police
made their appearance, fortunately too late
to prevent a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Volumes could not prove
more demonstratively the value of skill in
the art of boxing as turning the scale against
mere weight and strength, than this one-sided
contest of Mace and Hurst. Poor
Hurst, who had been trained by Turkish
Baths, instead of hard work, ought
not to have fought this battle. Apart
from his want of condition, however,
it was quite manifest he was not cut out for
a fighting man. He had little knowledge of
the art of self-defence, could not hit straight
from the shoulder, and it was obvious that
a man of his build and gait&mdash;&#8203;even when endowed
with the uncommon powers he displayed
as a receiver&mdash;&#8203;cannot hope to contend
with success against extraordinary cleverness
and activity, even though possessed by
a man of far lighter calibre than himself.
The unfortunate Sam was, however, a remarkably
straightforward fellow, and from
the first it was clear he had the interests of
his friends more at heart than his own, and
the greatest credit is due to him for his
manly perseverance. No credit, however,
is due to those who allowed him to go up
after every possible chance of success had
vanished.</p>

<p>     As to Mace, his fighting was faultless; he
was not called upon to display any great
amount of gameness, though the mere facing
such a giant and exchanging shots at close
quarters involves a confidence and coolness
that shows no small amount of personal
courage. As to Mace’s attack and defence,
they were in every respect indicative of the
master. It redounds to his praise that he
abstained from making a more rapid finish,
as he certainly might have done, unless restrained
by a desire to spare his almost helpless
antagonist. This battle elevated to the
Championship of England one of the most
finished boxers who had ever gained the
title.</p>

<p>Jem Mace was now on the pinnacle of success, and as&mdash;</p>

<p class="unindent">so the newly fledged Champion was carped at, criticised, challenged, and
unfavourably compared with all sorts and sizes of preceding and even contemporary
heroes of the Ring. As to the unconquered little Champion,
who had, after his great battle with John Heenan, in April, 1860, finally
bid farewell to the fistic stage, he had left no immediate successor; so “the
world seemed left” for Jem Mace “to bustle in,” and the question of the
cynical Cassius was for a time unanswered&mdash;</p>

<p>“Time and the hour,” however, never fail to bring “the man,” and in
these latter days of the Ring he came, in the person of Tom King, whose
<a name="Page_463" id="Page_463"></a><span class="pageno">463</span>
first appearance in November, 1860, and subsequent career, will form the
subject of the concluding chapter of our history.</p>

<p>The form displayed by King in his first two battles, although neither of
his opponents stood high in the pugilistic roll, was thought to give promise
that the belt might again revert to a Champion of the traditional 12-stone
calibre and stature.</p>

<p>There can be no dispute that after the retirement of Tom Sayers, the
public sympathy with the Ring and favour with its professors had completely
faded away, just as, in the preceding century (in 1760), after the
defeat of Slack by Stevens “the Nailer,” the title of Champion was dragged
through the dirt by a set of unworthy “knights of the <em>dirty</em> cross,” until its
restoration by the brave Tom Johnson. At a later period came its reestablishment
in more than its former renown by John Jackson,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_34" id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span>
George
Humphries, Mendoza, John Gully, the Belchers, Tom Cribb, and Tom
Spring, and their successors, who live only in these pages which record its
“decline and fall.”</p>

<p>To return from digression, we may state that the challenge of Tom King,
and the signing of articles for £200 a side, for a meeting on the 28th of
January, 1862, excited but faint interest even in those circles where a
struggle for the Championship was wont to set all upon the <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</span>.
Indeed, those who were anxious that a change for the better should take
place, and a removal of the disgraceful disorder which had driven from the
ring-side those on whom both pugilism and pugilists depended for their
existence, were fain to confess that pugilism was dead&mdash;&#8203;dead by the hands
of its own pretended friends, and the misconduct of prizefighters themselves.
Still a few of “the old guard” rallied round the colours; and the
good character of Tom King, with the now well-earned reputation of Mace,
gave them hopes of a revival of honesty, manliness, skill, and “a fair field
and no favour” for both men.</p>

<p>The morning of the 28th of January, 1862, dawned&mdash;&#8203;if such dim light as
struggled through the dense masses of dark clouds deserved the name of
dawn&mdash;&#8203;wet, cold, cheerless and miserable, and to add to this unpromising
look-out, there were added unpleasant rumours that the “authorities” of
half a dozen home counties had taken sweet counsel together how to frustrate
the fight; that the magnates of the railway boards had been notified
and communicated with on the subject of sinful “specials,” and the complicity
<a name="Page_464" id="Page_464"></a><span class="pageno">464</span>
of conveying company to the field of blood; that every police inspector
and superintendent had been put on his mettle by the solemn warnings
of “My Grandmother,” the <cite>Record</cite>, <cite>Watchman</cite>, and a host of “unco guid”
newspapers and puritanical preachers, of “the awful responsibility to God
and man” they incurred in not “stamping out” this “national sin.” We
quote from a Sheffield print and preacher, who thus charitably described a
fair and manly contest for the belt&mdash;&#8203;the symbol of skill and courage in the
exercise of the most humane mode of often unavoidable encounter between
man and man, especially among the lower orders. We name Sheffield,
because it was not long after infamous for the “organised assassination”
council of Messrs. Broadhead and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>; whilst its “public instructors”
were denouncing and suppressing an art which certainly does not include
ginger-beer bottles charged with blasting-powder placed under the beds of
the wives and children of obnoxious parents; cylinders of dynamite thrown
through the fanlights or windows of humble dwellings; the use of loaded
bludgeons and fire-arms from street corners or behind dead walls; the
splitting of grindstones; or the cutting of driving-bands, as modes of settling
personal or popular disputes. Yet from all these murderous and treacherous
cruelties the anti-fistic teachings of the Reverend Mr. Lilyliver failed
to wean and guard his “lambs.” We return from this digression to our
own “muttons,” whom, we opine, even in their last and worst days, were as
unlike “lost sheep,” and perhaps less like “goats,” than their saintly
slanderers.</p>

<p>Thus pleasantly forewarned by the croaker pessimists, the “managers”
prudently declined to give any hint of the “whereabouts” until the Monday
night previous to the encounter (January 28th), when tickets were
purchasable at Jem Mace’s house (Jem was now landlord of the “Old
King John,” Holywell Lane, Shoreditch), and at Nat Langham’s new
house, the “Mitre,” <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s Lane, merely conveying the facts that the
rendezvous was at London Bridge, and at the unusually early hour of six
o’clock. The difficult point of choosing a referee was also judiciously
arranged for. Arrived at the terminus of the South Eastern, we found a
more numerous gathering of the “right sort” than we had anticipated; a
proof that “still in their ashes lurked their former fires,” and that a well-conducted
mill had yet attractions for the legitimate patrons of the sport.
The last two championship battles (those between Tom Paddock and the
Staleybridge Infant, Hurst, and Jem Mace and the same clumsy giant) were
not, viewed as battles, anything but exposures of the lamentable lack of
<a name="Page_465" id="Page_465"></a><span class="pageno">465</span>
good men; while the disgraceful confusion, and double interruption of the
police, of the yet more recent fight between Bob Brettle and Rooke, almost
extinguished the last hope of the survival of the Provincial Ring.</p>

<p>It was nearly seven when the bell rang for departure, and the train
steamed away on its journey. Owing to the excellent arrangements of Nat
Langham, who acted for King, and Mr. Moss Phillips, who attended to the
interests of Mace, all parties were duly deposited at their destination at a
little after eight o’clock, Mace attended by Jack Hicks and Bob Travers the
Black, his late opponent, and King by Bos Tyler and Jerry Noon. King, who
had trained at Mr. Packwood’s, at Hammersmith, was in first-rate fettle;
nor was Mace, who had taken his breathings near Norwich, and latterly
near Newmarket, one whit behind him in respect of condition; each was
“fit to fight for a man’s life.” “It is a long lane that has no turning,”
and as we looked at the orderly array of the inner and outer ring, and the
attentiveness of the ring-constables, armed with their brass-bound whips
and their badges, we flattered ourselves for a time that the turning-point
had been reached, and that “a fair fight and no favour, and may the best
man win,” might once again be a phrase with a meaning. Thus dreaming,
as “hope told a flattering tale,” we addressed ourselves to the duty of
observing the fight we here chronicle.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Having gone through the customary
friendly salutation at the scratch,
each man drew back and threw himself into
position. There was at this moment a
silence that might be felt, and the eager
glances directed by all toward the combatants
evinced the interest with which
every movement was being watched by those
surrounding the ring. There was undoubtedly
much to rivet the attention of
the patrons of the art; for though both
were unquestionably fine fellows, yet there
was that disparity between them which
could not fail to impress itself even on the
uninitiated. Mark the towering height of
King, standing a clear 6 feet 2 inches in his
stockings, and, as he faces his opponent with
attentive watchfulness, but without a sign
of nervousness or anxiety, how immense
and preponderating appear the advantages
in his favour. Tom, we were informed by
Langham, when he last scaled, pulled down
12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, and taken for all in all must be
declared a model man, although some
judges of athletes declared his loins too
slender for a man of his height Tom, like
Mace, has a bright, keen eye, but he lacks the
square-out jaw bone and hard angular contour
which some judges of “points” declare
to be always found in the “thoroughbred”
boxer. Be that as it may, King’s length
of reach, firm, round muscle, skin ruddy
with the glow of health, and cheerful,
courageous aspect gave promise of a formidable
opponent, even to the scientific
Champion, Jem Mace. As to the Champion,
who pulled down 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> on the
preceding Monday, he was “all there,”
and as he himself said, felt “fit as a fiddle.”
After keeping on guard a few seconds,
during which Mace was keenly scrutinising
him, Tom dropped his hands, resting
his left upon his left thigh; Jem, being out of
range, and seeing that Tom had lowered his
daddles, followed suit, and the position of
the pair at this moment caused some
astonishment. Tom rubbed his left forearm
with his right hand, and Jem, who
also felt the chilly effects of the morning
air on coming out of his flannels, rubbed
his breast with his right palm. Tom, in
shifting, had got nearer his own corner, when
Jem advanced, and, from the manner he
gathered himself together, evidently intended
mischief; his left was admirably
poised, while his right played with firm
elasticity, ready as a guard, or, if occasion
presented itself, a shoot. Tom, however,
<a name="Page_466" id="Page_466"></a><span class="pageno">466</span>
was on the alert, and Mace, after putting
out a feeler or two, sprung back to tempt
Tom to follow. King, who at first seemed
a little puzzled, smiled and retreated, cool as
a cucumber in an ice-well. There was
more than one repetition of the movement
we have here described, the men shifting,
changing position, and manœuvring all
over the ring without coming to business.
King had heard so much of the
ability of Mace that he felt he was standing
before the best tactician of the day, and
would not lead off. Mace, on the other
hand, with the perception of a practised
general, found that he had before him a
dangerous and determined antagonist; one
whom it would not do to treat in the style
he had made an example of big Sam Hurst.
At length, after a display of almost every
sort of drawing and defensive tactic, Mace
got well in, delivering a neat nobber with
the left, stopping the return, and getting
away. King dashed at him, his height enabling
him to hit over Jem’s guard, and
Tom got one in on Mace’s head with the
right; the men closed and fibbed, then
getting on to the ropes, both went down. The
seconds were instant in their attendance,
Bos Tylor claiming “first blood” for King,
which was admitted, as the cochineal was
trickling from a cut on the Champion’s
shin. King’s partizans were in ecstasies,
and “Who’ll lay 2 to 1 now?” met no response.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;The cold rain now came down in
earnest, and did not much abate throughout
the rest of the mill. With ready
alacrity each man came from his corner
and scratched simultaneously with his opponent.
Mace, who was still bleeding,
looked flushed. After a little sparring,
Mace popped in his left. His second hit
was prettily countered, but notwithstanding
King’s length, Jem’s blow seemed hardest,
reaching home a “thought” before his
adversary’s poke. Another exchange, Tom
getting on the side of Mace’s head, but not
severely, and Jem’s smack in return sounding
all round the ring. In the close both
were down.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;The ball had now been fairly opened,
and each bout improved the spirit of the
performance, on which even the pitiless
rain could not throw a damper. Jem, on
coming from his corner, was still distilling
the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">elixir vitæ</span> from the old spot, which as
yet seemed the only mark made. King
went dashing in to force the fighting, and
the hot haste of the onslaught marred the
pretty position of Jem. Tom, who seemed
to hit from the forearm rather than the
shoulder, got home his left on the jaw, and
then, with the right, reached Jem’s head;
his superiority of length of reach being fully
demonstrated. Jem, however, quite balanced
accounts by two severe props in the
nob; King closed, and Mace got down easy.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;The rapidity of King’s fighting seemed
somewhat to surprise Mace, and he moved
right and left in front of his man, his point
well covered. Tom dashed in left and
right, and went to work, his counsel advising
the forcing principle; King, in hitting
out, had his left hand partially open;
Mace cross-countered with the left a smasher,
but a second attempt passed over King’s
shoulder. Jem broke away, and in retreating
got to the centre stake. Tom, following,
dashed out his right, when Mace ducked his
head and slipped down, thereby escaping a
rasper.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Mace first to scratch, King promptly
facing him. As Tom tried to lead off with
the left, Mace showed how well he was fortified
by his left-hand guard, and then retaliating
with the right. King, in turn, retreated.
Tom, in shifting, got to the ropes,
when Jem weaved in, getting both hands on
head and body. Tom lashed out both hands
defensively, but could not keep Jem off
until he chose to retire to his own corner,
where he got cleverly out of difficulty and
was down.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;King had evidently got home at the
close of the last round, for Jem came up
with his proboscis tinted with the carmine.
Tom dashed at his man with more determination
than judgment, hit from the forearm
without doing execution; Jem, hitting up as
he made the backward break, gave Master
Tom a straightener, who, persevering, got
his man down at the ropes; no harm done.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Jem advanced to the scratch with a
firm step and determined bearing, as if the
difficulties of his position had only produced
a concentration of the resolute “I will.”
The men stood eyeing each other in the
pelting rain; Jem rubbed his chest, which
had a large red mark as though a warm plaster
had recently been removed. After manœuvring
round the ring, Mace got to range,
delivering a well-aimed shot on King’s
cranium. As Jem broke ground he nearly
lost his equilibrium from the slipperiness of
the grass, but quickly steadied himself.
After a feint or two, they got well together
and countered splendidly, Mace sending
home his left on Tom’s right cheek, King
getting his right on the Champion’s left
peeper, raising a small bump, and causing
him to blink like an owl in sunshine. The
men, with mutual action, broke away, and
manœuvred all over the ring. At last Jem,
measuring his man accurately, gave him
such a left-hander on the snuff-box that
claret <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">du premier crû</span> was copiously uncorked.
As Mace retreated after this smack
Tom went in rather wildly, and closing, got
his left leg between Mace’s and threw him.
(Cheers for King.)</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Tom no sooner faced his man than he
made play, and got his right arm round
Mace; he then tried to lift him by main
strength for a throw, but the Champion
put on the head-stop, with his hand on
Tom’s face, and King had to let him go
down an easy fall.
</p>
<a name="Page_467" id="Page_467"></a><span class="pageno">467</span>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;King, by the advice of his seconds,
again forced the fighting, slung out both
hands, and closed, when Mace cleverly put
on the back heel, and down went Tom
undermost.</p>

<p>     10 to 14.&mdash;&#8203;The ropes had now got slack,
and Puggy White busied himself in driving
the stakes deeper, and tightening them.
In this and the following four rounds, King
still led off, and though his hits did not
seem severe, he had got as often on Jem’s
eye and nose, that his friends were confident
of his pulling through.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;The odds seemed melting away like
butter in the sun, and the backers of the
Champion were just becoming “knights of
the rueful countenance;” while Tom’s
partisans were as merry and chirpy as
crickets; Jerry Noon, especially, dispensing
an unusual and unseemly store of chaff
among the despondent patrons of Mace.
King once again went at his man, and both
were down at the ropes. King’s seconds
claimed the battle for a “foul,” alleging
that Mace had tried to force his fingers into
King’s eye in the struggle at the ropes;
the referee crossed the ring to caution
Mace, who indignantly denied any intention
of so unmanly an action.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;King seemed determined to lose no
time. He rattled in, and Mace, nothing loth,
stood up and hit with him, certainly
straightest and swiftest. In the close both
were down at the ropes.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;In sparring, the combatants changed
positions, and paused in the centre of the
ring. King had been fighting very fast,
and wanted a breathing time. On resuming,
he went in, and after some exchanges Mace
got down easy at the ropes.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Sharp exchanges, left and right, on
the cheek, mouth, and jaw, when Jem, in
shifting, dipped down. His seconds ran to
him, but he motioned them away, resumed
his perpendicular, and beckoned Tom with
a smile to renew the bout. The challenge
was cheerfully accepted, and fighting into a
close both were down.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;The men were admirably seconded
in both corners, and both came up clean
and smiling, though each had the contour
of his countenance seriously altered by his
opponent’s handiwork. In a close both
fibbed away merrily and both were down.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;There was an objection by Jerry
Noon that Mace had some “foreign substance”
in his left hand, King opened his
hands before the referee, and Mace, following
his example, merely showed a small piece
of paper in his palm, which, however, he
threw away. Mace’s left hand seemed
somewhat puffed, and Tom’s leading counsel,
observing this, told King that his adversary’s
“left was gone,” which it was not,
for Mace, this time, took the initiative, and
landed the left sharply on Tom’s cheek.
As Mace broke ground Tom followed, and
when near the stake he landed a round
hit from the right on Jem’s left jaw that
sent him to grass&mdash;&#8203;a clean knock-down
blow.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;Tom, eager to be at work, went in,
but he did not take much by his motion;
after several exchanges, Jem retreated.
Mace slipped and got between King’s legs
in a defenceless position, holding himself
up by the handkerchief round Tom’s waist.
King gallantly withheld his hand, threw up
his arms and smiled, walking to his corner
amidst general cheering.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;King was now the favourite, odds
being offered on him of 6 to 4, but no takers.
King, as before, began the business, and
Mace was down to close the round.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;This was a harmless bout. King
bored in; Mace missed as he retreated,
backed on to the ropes, and got down.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;Both men came up with alacrity,
despite the pelting rain which streamed
down their faces and limbs. King was
evidently slower, and Mace tried a lead.
He did not, however, get quite near enough,
and Tom pursued him round the ring until
both were down, Mace undermost.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;A curious round. Tom dashed at
Mace, who stopped him, then twisted
round and got away. Tom followed, and
Mace propped him; at the ropes, when
down, both men patted each other in a good
tempered manner.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;Mace came up determinedly, but
exhibited ugly punishment off the left eye
and mouth. Still he was steady, and met
Tom’s onslaught cleverly. King closed and
tried to hold up Mace, but he slipped
through his hands.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;Tom administered a right hander on
the jaw, and down went Mace against his
will for the second time.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;Mace recovered from the effects of his
floorer in an amazing manner. Tom had
now a serious bump on his right eye the
size of a walnut, and had otherwise lost his
facial symmetry. His friends were, however,
more than sanguine, and urged him
to keep his man at it. Tom tried to do so,
but got nothing at it, and in the fall hit
the stake.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;King got a round right-hander on
Mace’s back of his head, and both were
down&mdash;&#8203;a side fall.</p>

<p>     30.&mdash;&#8203;Mace seemed wonderfully steady,
and in good form. King, as before, made
play; the ground was so soddened, cut up,
and pasty, that a good foothold was impossible.
Tom sent in his right, and Jem, with
well-judged precision, returned with both
mauleys, when King embraced him, but
Mace put on the back-heel, and threw Tom
cleverly on his back; as Mace rose first from
the ground he patted King in a good-tempered
manner, amidst cries of “Bravo,
Mace!”</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;King, as he sat on his second’s knee,
seemed much distressed. His sides heaved
like a forge-bellows; his seconds were most
assiduous, and sent him up clean and fresh.
Tom came slowly from his corner; not so
<a name="Page_468" id="Page_468"></a><span class="pageno">468</span>
Jem, who advanced quickly to the scratch,
and then tried to entice his man to lead
off. At last he did so, and gave King as
good as he sent, when Tom forced Mace to
the ropes. The latter turned himself round,
reversing their positions, and, after a short
wrestle, threw Tom with the back-heel a
fair fall.</p>

<p>     32.&mdash;&#8203;Exchanges; King on the body, Mace
on the head, and both down.</p>

<p>     33.&mdash;&#8203;King still forcing the fighting; Mace
as lively as a grasshopper. After some
pretty exchanges, Mace got home the left
on his opponent’s right cheek&mdash;&#8203;a cutter&mdash;&#8203;a
close, some fibbing, and both down, King
over the lower rope, and partly out of the
ring.</p>

<p>     34.&mdash;&#8203;Mace first from his corner, but had
not long to wait for his opponent. Tom hit
out with better intention than judgment,
and failed to do execution. A close, Mace
again got King with the back-heel, and
threw him heavily.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;The sun of success was brightening
in the East, though the clouds were pouring
heavily. King was suffering from his protracted
exertions, and “bellows to mend”
was the case in his corner. His heart was
good, and he fought gallantly into a close,
catching pepper; Mace, after delivering a
flush hit, falling in the middle of the ring.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;After a little manœuvring, the men
got on the ropes, when King slipped down
by a pure accident. As King’s friends had
objected to Mace’s style of getting down,
there were derisive counter-cheers and cries
of “foul!” followed by enthusiastic cheers
for both men.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;Tom’s seconds found that their plan
of forcing the fighting had miscarried, and
now gave opposite advice. King waited for
Mace, who manœuvred and feinted, until
Tom let go his left, and was countered artistically.
Mace then stepped in and delivered
his left full in King’s dial and in an exchange
both were down in the middle of the
ring.</p>

<p>     38&ndash;40.&mdash;&#8203;King, finding Mace his master
at out-fighting, resumed his plan of going
to work just as he was getting second wind.
The rounds again were of the old pattern;
King got the larger and heavier share of the
hitting, and both were down, Mace choosing
his own time to end the round. In the
40th round, King complained of Mace using
him unfairly, but the referee saw nothing
calling for his notice.</p>

<p>     41, 42, 43 and last.&mdash;&#8203;King was visibly distressed
in the first two of these three final
rounds. In the last of these bouts the combatants
closed in the middle of the ring, when
Mace, who had delivered a heavy thwack on
King’s neck, struggled with him for the fall.
In going down, King, who was undermost,
struck the front of his head with great force
on the ground. Tom’s seconds had him in his
corner in an instant, as the position was
critical. The die was however, cast. “Time!”
was called in vain. Mace, who was eagerly
watching his opponent’s corner, advanced
to the scratch. The referee entered the
ring, watch in hand. The eight seconds
were counted; but King was still deaf to
the call of “Time!” and Mace was hailed
the winner, after one hour and eight minutes
of rapid fighting on both sides. Scarcely
had the fiat gone forth when a posse of
police made their appearance, who, to do
them justice, seemed glad that the affair
was over before their arrival.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;The principal point to be
noted is the admirable manner in which both
the loser and winner fought out this gallant
contest. The superiority of Mace as a
scientific pugilist alone enabled him to contend
with and finally defeat his brave,
powerful, and in size and physique formidable
antagonist; while to Tom King, the
loser, the credit must be awarded of doing
all that man could do towards victory, and
yielding only to absolute physical incapability
to continue the contest. Although,
however, the majority were satisfied that
the best man won, there was one who entertained
the opposite opinion, and that
was Tom King himself, as we shall presently
see.</p>

<p>In April, 1862, some curiosity was awakened in fistic circles by the
return of John Heenan to England, preceded by an <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">annonce</span> in the
American newspapers that he had “gone over to fetch the old belt, and to
fight Mace, the so-called Champion.” Hereupon Messrs. Moss Phillips
and John Gideon waited upon Heenan, on Mace’s behalf, offering to find
£500 or £1,000, if needful, to make a match. Heenan repudiated
the newspaper buncombe, saying that he had come over with the sole
object of fulfilling an engagement with Messrs. Howe and Cushing’s Circus
Troupe, and that he had “cut pugilism,” at least for the present. Jem,
who was now a London “pub.,” and host of the “King John,” in Holywell
<a name="Page_469" id="Page_469"></a><span class="pageno">469</span>
Lane, was also on tour with Ginnett’s Circus, while in <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> he
declared his readiness to “meet any man for £1,000, barring neither
country, colour, nor weight.” In reply to this, Bob Brettle, still sore
from defeat, and, as he declared, “the ungrateful conduct of Mace,” undertook
to back “an Unknown” for £200 and the belt against the Champion,
and this Mace accepted. Hereupon King came out with a statement
that Mace had requested him not to challenge him “at present,” for reasons
which he gave, but now, as he had accepted a challenge, he (King) claimed
first turn. It may be proper here to remark that King had joined Mace, at
his request, in a sparring tour early in 1862, which lends strength to King’s
statement. Mace’s backer having offered Brettle’s “Unknown” £25 to
indemnify him for his forfeit and expenses, articles were signed at Nat
Langham’s, on June 18th, for a fight for £200 a side and the belt, to come
off within six months, the precise day not to be divulged until the night
before the battle, which was to take place in November or December.
How Tom King reversed the former verdict in 21 rounds, occupying 38
minutes, on the 26th November, 1862, may be read in the Memoir of King
in the ensuing Chapter.</p>

<p>King having publicly declared his retirement from the Ring, Mace
resumed the style of “Champion,” with whatever honours might still
attach to that tarnished title.</p>

<p>In December, 1862, Joe Goss, of Wolverhampton, an unbeaten pugilist,
weighing 10<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, boldly offered himself to the notice of Mace for
“any sum from £200 to £500 a side;” and although the Wolverhampton
man waived any claim to the belt as the result of the battle, it was said by
his friends that they did not see why, if Mace alone barred the way, their
man should not claim the trophy. The match, though made in December,
1862, had a most unbusiness-like aspect in some of its details. The time
of meeting being named as “nine months after date”&mdash;&#8203;a most suspicious
period of gestation for such an affair&mdash;&#8203;September 1st, 1863, was the day.
Nor was the amount of stakes less calculated to tax belief, £1,000 being
set down in the book; Mace to post £600 to Goss’s £400, of which the
Norwich’s man’s backers were to table £330 to Goss’s £220 at the final
deposit.</p>

<p>Match-making, at this time, appears to have got “considerably mixed.”
In May and June, Bill Ryall, of Birmingham, a twelve-stone man, “seeing
that Goss, though articled to fight Mace, did not pretend to the Championship,”
offered himself for “the belt and £200 a side, to the notice of
<a name="Page_470" id="Page_470"></a><span class="pageno">470</span>
the Norwich hero,” after he had disposed of Goss. Mace assented, and
articles were signed, but before the decision of the affair now under notice.
Ryall’s friends appear to have repented of their rash engagement, and
forfeited the £25 or £30 down, as the penalty of their indiscretion. The
Brettle party’s choice of Ryall as the man to lower the pretensions of
Mace will seem the more surprising when we state that Goss had beaten
Ryall on September 24th, 1860, and had fought him to a stand-still in
a drawn battle for £100, February 11th, 1862. We will now return
from this brief digression to the first encounter of Mace and Gross.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_35" id="fnanchor_35"></a><a href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span>
</p>

<p>On the making good of the last deposit of £330 to £220, and the
announcement that it was duly “banked” in the hands of the Editor of
<cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, the almost dormant interest of many of the incredulous was
<a name="Page_471" id="Page_471"></a><span class="pageno">471</span>
awakened, and crowds of anxious West End inquirers thronged to the
“Mitre” (Nat had shifted from the “Cambrian”), the “Three Tuns,”
the “Horseshoe,” the “Rising Sun,” the “Queen’s Head,” and the “Blue
Boar’s Head;” while the East Enders were as eager in their endeavours to
obtain the “straight tip” by looking in at Harry Orme’s, Joe Rowe’s,
Jemmy Welsh’s, Jem Cross’s, Jem Ward’s, Billy Richardson’s, and the
Champion’s own crib in Holywell Lane, Whitechapel.</p>

<p>Mr. Tupper having won the toss for Goss, the men went to scale at his
house, the “Greyhound,” Waterloo Road, when both were found within
the stipulated 10 stone 10 lbs., and, as we can safely affirm, from ocular
demonstration, in the perfection of condition.</p>

<p>In the face of a vigilant and hostile magistracy and police, the managers
necessarily adopted unusual precautions to confine the knowledge of the
time and place to none but “safe men.” Accordingly, not only was the
day kept secret, but it was not until the overnight that even the line of rail
and amount of fare were disclosed to intending “excursionists.” When
the “office” was given to those who were prepared to invest £2 2s. in
cardboard, the rendezvous was stated to be the Paddington terminus of the
Great Western, and the time <em>two o’clock</em> a.m., on the morning of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Partridge,
September 1st, 1863; and thither, at that unreasonable and
unseasonable hour, did the “sheep destined for the shearing” eagerly
repair.</p>

<p>Unhappily for the fortunes, nay, the very existence of the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>, it had
become the practice of the floating fraternity of thieves, mobsmen, and
“roughs”&mdash;&#8203;the latter too often combining the two former in the same
ruffianly individual&mdash;&#8203;to stream to the railway station whenever they got
scent of a Ring “excursion,” instinctively knowing that there plunder
might be perpetrated. As where the carcase is, there will the birds of
prey be gathered, so on this 1st of September in the darkness and gloom
of a cloudy morning, a riot was got up outside the entrances to the noble
building, and many persons hustled, robbed, and occasionally personally
ill-treated, by a disorderly crowd which, we can of our own avouch declare,
did not comprise in its whole body one single known pugilist. Yet more
than one of our “best possible public instructors” informed the public that
“a mob of prize-fighters and other ruffians robbed and maltreated
the intending travellers with lawless impunity.” Passing the baseless
imputation that “prize-fighters and other ruffians” were personally engaged
in this nocturnal <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span>, we must declare that of all the scenes of riot and
<a name="Page_472" id="Page_472"></a><span class="pageno">472</span>
disorder we have witnessed, that at Paddington was the most disgraceful,
and marked the lowest stage in the downward journey of the Ring, unless
we accept the wrangles and rows of the partisans of the men at some minor
fights as exemplifying the Miltonic paradox&mdash;</p>

<p>At the hour of four the train steamed out of the station, and it was
currently stated that Wootton Bassett, in Wiltshire, about five miles below
the great engine-works at Swindon, was our destination. On arriving at
Didcot Junction it was perceived that the Oxfordshire constabulary were
awake, like Johnny Cope, “Sae airly in the mornin’;” but their only
exercise of their function on this occasion seemed to be to wave us a courteous
farewell as we steamed off, with the addition of a few “’Varsity men” (in
masquerade) who had become possessed of “the secret,” and joined our
party. At Swindon we “watered” our iron horse, and about five miles
farther the brakes were on, and all soon alighted. After some little
refreshment of the inward man from the stores of a well-plenished hamper,
the “meynie” getting what they could at a neighbouring public, we
tramped a mile of a dirty lane, until it opened on a spot where the Commissary
(Fred Oliver) and assistants had laid out an excellent ring.
And now began the customary squabble between the “clever ones”
on each side about the choice of a referee. The Editor of the chief
sporting journal, for nearly forty years the consistent and able advocate
and supporter of the Ring, had finally refused the now dangerous
position, and had recently, in consequence of disorderly defiance of the
representative of the paper, forbidden his reporter to officiate, unless in
circumstances he might consider exceptional. Thus much valuable time
was cut to waste. Finally, the reporter of a new sporting paper consented
to act, was enthroned on the judge’s straw truss, and the men quickly made
themselves ready. As they stood up Joe looked “as hard as nails,” while
Mace’s elegant position, as he stood awaiting the anticipated onslaught of
his opponent, was pronounced by more than one judge to be “beautiful.”
To the surprise of all, however, after some not very graceful squaring of
elbows and half-steps left and right, never venturing beyond the scratch,
Joe retreated, and shaking his head with a grim smile invited his adversary
to approach. Jem did not seem to perceive the advisability of this, so he
smiled and nodded in return. Presently, after a shift or two right and left,
Mace advanced, resolved to open the ball. Joe retreated, covering his
<a name="Page_473" id="Page_473"></a><span class="pageno">473</span>
points well, when from the outer ring rose a warning cry, and ere its
cause could be asked, half a dozen “prime North Wiltshires”&mdash;&#8203;not cheeses,
but policemen&mdash;&#8203;rolled into the ring. Mace darted under the ropes and
skedaddled into a thicket, his retreat covered by his seconds, bearing his
outward habiliments; while Joe had nearly rushed into the arms of one of
the “rurals,” but luckily gave him the go-by, and “made tracks” in
another direction. Meantime the “bobbies,” with the utmost good-humour,
surveyed the flight, and, without interfering with the Commissary, left him
to reload his light cart with the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">impedimenta</span> of the ring, then, slowly following
the discomfited company, saw them safely down the road on their
return to the train, which soon returned at the appointed signal from a
“siding” where it had been temporarily located. Once on board, though
the day was yet young, the victims were politely informed that no more
could be done that day, and that the “Company’s” obligation to the “train
charterers” would be discharged by the delivery of the “excursionists” at
their starting-point at Paddington. “But,” added the referee, in an immediate
conference, “I shall order, as I am empowered by the Rules, the men
to meet again this day, at Fenchurch Street Station, and go down to Purfleet.
When there, we must be guided by circumstances; but we will have the fight
off to-day if possible.” That this was “gall and wormwood” to sundry persons
who looked to another “special” rather than a “result” might easily be seen.
They did not, however, dare to do more than prophesy disaster and obstruction,
and propose “a meeting at the stakeholder’s,” or anywhere else, to procure
postponement, which was properly and peremptorily negatived.</p>

<p>Arrived at Paddington, the neighbouring cab-stands were quickly cleared
of their yawning waiters, whose glee at this unexpected and profitable “call”
was certainly heightened when they “twigged,” as one of the cabbies told us,
that they were “a-helping some of the right sort out of a fix.” At Fenchurch
Street conveyance to Purfleet was quickly arranged for, and at
3h. 30m. the men, <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">materiel</span>, and company were duly delivered at the riverside.
Here it was resolved, and prudently, that a transit to Plumstead
Marshes should be made, as suspicious movements of an “Essex calf” were
observed. Long Reach cost many no less a sum than ten shillings for the
ferry; but this did not stop those who could command the best and least
crowded boats, and at five o’clock, in a well-formed and certainly select
ring,

<p class="center">THE FIGHT</p>

<p>Began with Round 2; for we suppose we
most pay the compliment to the <em>four and a
half minutes</em> of “fiddling” at Wootton
Bassett, as counting for Round 1. As before
it was expected that the “terrific Joe”
would force the fighting, and show that
game and hard hitting must tell against
mere skill, with a slight and apparently ineradicable
suspicion among the provincials
from the North Midlands that Mace had a
“soft place” which Joe was the very man
to find out. Nevertheless, the Londoners
offered 6 and even 7 to 4 on Mace. Again
Joe retreated, and as Jem followed got
away again and again, though in anything
but a graceful style. His intention to fight
a crafty battle was apparent, and did not
seem to please his country friends. At last
the men came to a stand, Joe having his
back to the ropes. Jem let go his left
sharply, but was prettily parried. Mace
drew back, when Joe, plunging at him, got
home his left straight on the body, getting,
as might be expected, a rattling smack on
the mouth in return. Goss licked his lips,
and dodged about; Mace got closer, and,
swift as thought, planted a cutting left-hander
on the left eyebrow. It was a
caution, and the crimson instantly following,
“first blood” was awarded to Mace. Joe
in jumping away from Mace’s advance
slipped and fell.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Long and tedious sparring and manœuvring
prefaced this round. Goss, to
the dissatisfaction of many, being determined
to avoid close quarters, and Mace
equally resolved not to give a chance away
at long shots. When they got closer, Mace
sent in his left, and then his right slap in
the middle of Joe’s head, when a couple of
slashing counter-hits followed, Mace again
delivering with precision on the head, and
Goss on Mace’s forehead and chest. More
sparring, Joe looking quite vicious, and
twice missing his shifty adversary, until
the latter accepted a rally, and some extraordinary
counter-hitting took place to
the advantage of Mace, he reaching Joe’s
head, while the latter got home on the
chest or shoulder. Joe was driven back,
and as Mace pressed on to him slipped
down.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;The men seemed warming to their
work, and lost no time in the useless
dodging which marked the previous rounds.
Mace led off and jobbed his man severely
through his guard, following his first smack
with another, and then getting away. Goss,
though quick in his returns, was hurried,
and twice missed his right by Maces’s quickness
in shifting. Mace worked round into
the centre of the ring, when Joe bored in,
in what his friends called his “own old
style.” In the exchanges Joe dealt Mace a
tremendous hit on the right eye, which
instantly left its mark. Mace broke ground
and retreated with his hands up in good
form. (Vociferous shouting from the Gossites,
“The Young’un wins! The Young’un
wins!” and the excitement was immense
at the Wolverhampton corner.) Mace
steadied himself, and, after a short pause,
Goss tried to get on to him again, when,
after some two-handed fighting not remarkable
for effectiveness, Mace caught his adversary
such a well-distanced left-hander
on the head that Joe went clean down
against his will. (First knock-down for
Mace, being the second event scored.)</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;On appearing at the scratch the swollen
state of Mace’s right eye told how heavily
he had been hit in the preceding round.
Goss, urged by his seconds, dashed in left
and right, but was beautifully stopped.
Joe tried to play round his man, but Mace
stepped in, gave him a heavy hit in the
mouth, then, after a few quick exchanges,
closed and threw him.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Both men were now much marked,
showing how heavy the hitting had been.
Goss moved all over the ring as before, leading
off, but ineffectively, being either out
of distance or easily stopped. Eventually
they got close, and exchanged heavy left-handed
hits. More chasséeing about the
ring by Goss, till Jem got close, and brought
on more counters, Jem planting swift and
hard in the face with both hands. Goss
returned left and right on the head, and
went down on his knees at the ropes. Jem
was about to deliver a stinger, but checked
himself, laughed, and walked away.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Goss led off, but out of distance, as
was often the case when he attempted out-fighting.
A long series of movements with
no great merit in them followed, till Mace
got in with his left, and then fine counter-hits
came, Goss certainly hitting straighter
than he had done in some preceding rallies.
A little more manœuvring, and then Joe
went at his man, and brought on some stunning
exchanges&mdash;&#8203;very heavy left-handed
counters, Mace on the right cheek, Goss on
the forehead. Goss, in getting away, fell.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;Joe appeared at last to be tired of the
scientific and waiting business, and went
pluckily at Mace. He was certainly first in
the hitting, planting heavily left and right
on the head. Jem returned a couple of
smashers on the front of the head, and in
some severe exchanges his length and
straightness of delivery gave him the pull.
The men closed, and after a good wrestle, in
which Goss displayed great muscular power,
he got the best of the fall, Mace being under
him. (Great applause for Goss, who was
evidently fighting up hill.)</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Once more Joe tried to lead off, but
he was out of distance, and Mace could
evidently make the fighting as he chose. At
last they closed near the ropes, when they
<a name="Page_475" id="Page_475"></a><span class="pageno">475</span>
got a mutual hold, and some severe fibbing
took place, both men getting it hot until
they fell together.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Goss, instigated by his seconds, tried
a rush. He was neatly stopped, and seemed
perplexed as to his next move. Jem drew
back and Joe followed, got home his right
on the body slightly, and was away. Mace
stepped on to him, dealt him a left-hander
on the head, and Joe slipped down.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Mace now tried to make the fighting.
He stepped in upon Goss, who retired and
shifted round in the clear corner of the
ring; at last Jem pinned him a stinger in
the mouth, and then as he jumped sideways
caught him a second crack with the same
hand on the head; Goss rushed in, delivering
both hands, and Mace slipped down
amidst some hisses from Goss’s partisans.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Some tedious sparring. Mace, who
now evidently meant fighting, tried to
induce Goss to lead off, but he would not.
At length, Joe being, as Mace thought,
pushed in a corner, in he went, and a
spirited rally ensued. Mace got home on
Joe’s damaged left eyebrow, but Goss gave
him a couple of rib-benders, and, closing,
proved his strength by bringing down the
Champion a sounder on the turf, and falling
on him. (Deafening cheers&mdash;&#8203;“Joe’s waking
him up!”)</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;It was fully expected that Goss
would now go to work in the “finishing”
style that had earned his fame; but no!
He again resorted to that clumsy yokel
craftiness which could never beat a man of
Mace’s skill and resource. He dodged about
until Mace, seeing he had got him, dealt
him a sounding spank on the head with the
left, and then as he shifted about gave him
a straight punch in the mouth with the
same hand. Joe, stung with these visitations,
went in too late, for though he got in
a round hit on the side of Mace’s head, the
latter clinched him and threw him.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Goss, in performing his usual dancing
steps around the ring, caught his heel
against a stake and stumbled; Mace dashed
at him, when Joe got down somehow. (A
claim of “foul” was preferred by Mace’s
seconds, but overruled)</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Goss was urged to “rattle in,” but
he declined the experiment, and moved
round his man, then, lunging out heavily
with both hands got the left well home on
the side of the head. Mace got quickly
close, hit Joe severely in the mouth, and
Goss fell in hurriedly getting back.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Mace measured his man carefully as
they stood sparring in the centre of the ring,
and then swiftly sent in a stinging left-hander.
Joe shifted again, and Mace, pressing
him too closely, received a couple of
good hits on the head. Goss away as before;
Mace worked close to him, dealt him a crack
on the head, and as he stepped in again
Goss slipped down. (Disapprobation.)</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Goss all over the ring, but Mace
pressed after him more sharply than hitherto.
He fixed him at last, and delivered both
hands like lightning on the head. A slashing
rally, the best in the fight; Mace planting
with amazing quickness and force, left
and right, going home with severity. Joe
stuck to his work, and lashed out desperately
in return; but though he certainly
hit his man heavily, Mace must have felt
he had the superiority for good and all in
this rally. The men closed, exhausted by
severe exertion, and after a short struggle
fell together.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Goss came up bleeding freely from
the left brow, nose, and mouth. His punishment
was certainly severe; Mace was
also marked. After some sparring Joe
lashed out viciously with both hands, Mace
slipped back, and Joe, overreaching himself,
fell. No mischief done, but the Gossites
looked blue.</p>

<p>     19th and last.&mdash;&#8203;Both slow to time. Mace,
cool as a cucumber, seemed to be taking
stock of his adversary, as if beginning a
fight. Goss worked about, stepping first to
one side, then the other, as if nervously
anxious to begin “business.” Mace worked
him slowly backwards, till close on
the ropes, then, as Joe was about to break
away, he delivered a tremendous right-handed
lunge, straight from the shoulder;
the blow landed on the left side of Goss’s
left jaw, and at once hit him clean out of
time. Poor Goss fell forward insensible,
and all efforts of his seconds to rouse
him proving vain, Mace was proclaimed
the victor. Time, 1 hour, 55 minutes, 30
seconds.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;Notwithstanding the heavy
hitting which came at intervals, we must
pronounce this a bad fight; indeed, it could
hardly be otherwise. Goss was entirely
over-matched in science, length, and weight,
and evidently felt it early in the fight. His
dodging and clumsy wiles to steal a march
on so perfect a practitioner as Mace were
often almost ludicrous. His game, indeed his
only chance, was to have forced his man to
desperate rallies, and have trusted to his own
hardihood, courage and endurance&mdash;&#8203;though
this, we do not believe, could have altered
the final result. Mace, on the other hand,
was, considering his manifold advantages,
over-cautious. He not only would not risk
a chance, but he continually gave a chance
away by being too guarded. At the same
time, we must admit that Mace’s mode of
winning the battle on the line he had marked
out exhibited consummate skill.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>As a “side-light” may often elucidate a “dark corner,” we may remark,
that within a few weeks of this £1,000 victory we learned in a disputation,
<a name="Page_476" id="Page_476"></a><span class="pageno">476</span>
that a neighbouring publican, and backer of Mace, declared that Jem’s was
a “bogus” proprietorship, and that the Norwich “Champion” was
heavily indebted to him.</p>

<p>At this period a wave of cant was passing over the country. The
<cite>Morning Star</cite>, a London daily long since defunct, in which John
Bright, the pugnacious Quaker, was largely interested, was furious in
its denunciations of the authorities for what it called “their connivance
in the brutalities of prize-fighters.” Contemporary with the
scripturally named <cite>Morning Star</cite>, was a yet more straightlaced and puritan
print, rejoicing in the title of the <cite>Dial</cite>, whose mission, as we learned from
its prospectus, was to “purify the daily Press” by excluding from its
columns not only racing reports and “so-called sporting news,” but even
cases from the police-courts, divorce-courts, actions for slander or <i>crim.
con.</i>, and we know not what else of the doings of this naughty world. The
<cite>Dial</cite>, after threatening to supersede the <cite>Times</cite> (and all other dailies), spent
nearly all its capital in a very weakly issue, and finally threw the balance of
some thousands of pounds into the coffers of the <cite>Morning Star</cite>, which therefore
contracted a marriage, and added the words “and <cite>Dial</cite>” to its title. We
need not observe that marriage in the newspaper world invariably means the
death of the weaker vessel; and so the <cite>Morning Star</cite> and <cite>Dial</cite>, positively
treated its readers, after a few flourishes of condemnation, with a full,
true, and particular account of “this horrid prize-fight.” Surely hypocrisy
and the eagerness of saints to “turn a penny” could not further go? On
the other hand, the <cite>Saturday Review</cite>, a journal of manly independence, and
a sworn enemy of cant, published in its impression of the succeeding week
a life-like sketch from the pen of a scholar and a gentleman, of his adventures
in going to and coming from the fight, with his impressions of what
he saw thereat. Those who can refer to the number will thank us for the
reminder: here we can only find room for the closing reflections.</p>

<p>“Looking dispassionately at this fight, and without admitting or denying
the truthfulness of the descriptions of other fights that we have read, our
conclusion is, that the epithets ‘brutal,’ ‘barbarous,’ ‘disgusting,’ and so
forth, are quite uncalled for. There are people who don’t like fights, and
there are people who view them as displays of skill and fortitude. Yet
much that is objectionable in the acts of the supporters of the Ring and
the practitioners of the art would disappear if respectable society, so called,
dared to look less unkindly upon it and them. At any rate, we see no
sufficient reason why magistrates and police should display such excessive
<a name="Page_477" id="Page_477"></a><span class="pageno">477</span>
zeal in hunting down a fight in such an out-of-the-way place as Plumstead
Marshes, and are glad they did not finally succeed on Tuesday, September
1st, in disappointing the hundreds of people who had travelled 200 miles
to see the battle between Mace and Goss.”</p>

<p>So far as the history of the Prize Ring is concerned we would here
gladly close our record, leaving only the second combat of Tom King and
John Heenan for its finale; but a page or two of the suicidal doings of its
professors and destroying patrons must be added to complete its story.</p>

<p>In the first month of 1864 a challenge, as in 1860, came across the
Atlantic. This time the cartel was in the name of one Joe Coburn, an Irish
American, and was responded to by Mace, whose backers proposed a stake
of £500 a side; and on May 27th, the challenger, accompanied by Cusick,
known aforetime as the companion and trainer of John Heenan, and a
Mr. Edwin James,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_36" id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span>
who described himself as Editor of the <cite>New York
Clipper</cite>, arrived in London to settle the preliminaries.</p>

<p>The articles as finally drawn were to the effect that Mace’s party were
to post £600, to £400 on the part of Coburn, and that at the last deposit
£100 was to be handed to the latter as expenses; that a referee should
be agreed on the day previous to the fight, which should take place in
Ireland, over 20 and under 100 miles from Dublin; the money to be made
good in ten fortnightly deposits.</p>

<p>On the occasions of these diplomatic protocollings, which were conducted
with a Yankee ‘cuteness and cavilling that were suspiciously suggestive
of knavery rather than straightforward honesty of purpose, we saw a good
deal of Mr. Joe Coburn, and the more we saw of him the more assured
were we that the astute “managers” of the affair must have had some
other design in view than a fair fight for a thousand with such a man as
Jem Mace. Joe Coburn, who stood about 5 ft. 8½ in., was a well-built
fellow, something under 11 stone, and tolerably good-looking; his countenance
was the reverse of pugilistic in formation or outline, his nose
being decidedly of the Roman arch, and the bony contour of his face
and nob rather of the “hatchet” than either the “snake” or the “bullet-headed”
type. He told us that he was a native of Middletown, County
Armagh; that he was in his 26th year, having been born July 20th, 1838;
and that his parents took him to America at an early age. At first his
<a name="Page_478" id="Page_478"></a><span class="pageno">478</span>
“business matters” were entrusted to the care of the experienced Nat
Langham, but “Ould Nat” was soon thrust aside by the loquacious
Hiberno-American “agents,” “secretaries,” “friends and advisers” of
Mr. Coburn, who, of himself, appeared quiescent, modest, and taciturn.
And here a word on the wretched hands into which, in these latest days, the
interests of the Ring and pugilists had fallen. In times of old, but yet within
his memory, the writer has witnessed or been cognizant of conferences at
Tom Spring’s “Castle,” at Jem Burn’s, at Limmer’s Hotel, at Tattersall’s,
and especially in the editorial sanctum, the front parlour of No. 5, Norfolk
Street, Strand, whereat Honourables, M.P.’s, and gallant Guardsmen&mdash;&#8203;such
patrons of pugilism as the Marquises of Drumlanrig and Waterford, Lord
Ongley, Lord Longford, Sir Edward Kent, Sir <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Vincent Cotton, Harvey
Combe&mdash;&#8203;with squires, country gentlemen, and sportsmen, have taken part
in discussing the interests of fair and honest pugilism and pugilists, and
aiding them by purse and patronage. He may add that in those times
Lord Althorp (afterwards Earl Spencer),<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_37" id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span>
the present courtly diplomatist
and Foreign Minister, Earl Granville (Lord Leveson-Gower), the greatest
of the Sir Robert Peels, the Honourable Robert Grimston (brother to
the Earl of Verulam), Lord Wenlock, Lord Palmerston, and the now
venerable philanthropist, the Earl of Shaftesbury (then Lord Ashley),<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_38" id="fnanchor_38"></a><a href="#footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span>

with other “brave peers of England, pillars of the State,” did not disdain
to sanction and approve, by example, speech, and pen, the practice and
principles of boxing, and the peculiarly English and manly Art of Self-defence.</p>

<p>All these had already disappeared, or withdrawn in disgust, and left no
successors. Their places were usurped by a clamorous crew of sharp
practitioners, loud-mouthed disputants, and tricky match-makers&mdash;&#8203;the
sweepings of society in the Old and New Worlds. Those on this side of
<a name="Page_479" id="Page_479"></a><span class="pageno">479</span>
the water were backed by the ill-gotten gains of the keepers of low gambling
hells and night-houses, those on the other side by the proprietors of
bar-rooms, drinking-saloons, and the large crowd of loungers, loafers, and
rowdies who hang on the skirts of the Sporting World of the Great Republic
and are its disgrace and bane. The cardinal principle of these worthies,
like that of the “welshers” of our own race-courses, being “heads I win,
tails you lose,” it was certainly a trial for an Englishman’s patience and
gravity to hear and read it urged, as a reason for choosing Ireland as a
battle-ground, that our Hiberno-American cousins (or cozens) were afraid
their man “would not get fair play” in England. But we must proceed.</p>

<p>No sooner had the conditions been duly published to the world in the
sporting papers than the “high contracting parties” set off upon their
provincial tours, with the summer all before them. With Coburn’s progress
his “secretary” kept the newspaper press <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au courant</span>; we were told,
from week to week, how he put on the mittens with Joe Goss, Bill Ryall,
Jack Rooke, Reardon, and others, at Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool,
Glasgow, and Dublin, and of course “bested” them. Those who knew how
these things were arranged, took them with the needful “grain of salt,” and
we coupled them with the significant fact that three of the pugilists named
each separately expressed to us his envy at Mace’s good luck, and his regret
that <em>he</em> was not in his place to “try conclusions” with the newly imported
“champion.” Mace, too, was not behind in travelling the “circuits,”
having for his “agent in advance” and “secretary,” Harry Montague, well
known, even up to 1881, as secretary to “Myers’s Great American Hippodrome
and Circus.”</p>

<p>We skip over the months until we come to September 24th, at which
time, strange to say, not a single detail seemed to have been arranged by
either party, and when, at the last deposit at Harry Brunton’s, Barbican,
the £1,000 was declared to be made good, and the £100 cheque of the
stakeholder thereafter handed over to Coburn and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, we must confess
we were much exercised in mind to know what would be the next move in the
<span class="lang" lang="de" xml:lang="de">kriegspiel</span>. We were soon enlightened. Coburn’s representatives having
won the toss, communicated that the rendezvous would be Mr. Woodroffe’s,
“Cambridge Arms,” Island Bridge, near Dublin, on Monday, October 4th.
Accordingly, to “mak’ siccar,” we booked ourselves, on the previous Saturday,
by the “Wild Irishman” for Holyhead, and thence by the swift mail-packet,
the “Scotia,” landed early on Sunday morning at Kingstown,
suffering some delay from a tremendous south-wester in the Channel.
<a name="Page_480" id="Page_480"></a><span class="pageno">480</span>
Here we found our Irish friends all alive, and as full of questions and
eager inquiries for news as if they had been ancient instead of modern
Greeks. <cite>More Hibernico</cite>, too, we soon found that they could tell us
more than we knew about the matter; for by way of a secret we were
informed in the street, before we had landed six hours, that “Joe”
(Coburn) “shure was in Limerick, and that the foight ’ud come off nigh
hand there, at Goold’s Crass,” which, if thus publicly known, made us sure
that it would not. We stood on the pier watching the arrivals. By the
Liverpool packet came a large accession to the English division; among
them Jerry Noon, Bos Tyler, Welsh, Hicks, with Fred Oliver, the Commissary,
and his henchman, Puggy White, and not a few familiar faces
from London, Birmingham, Manchester, and the North.</p>

<p>In Dublin we found not a few “London particulars” of the Press:
the editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> (Frank Dowling), with young Holt as his aide-de-camp,
the editor of the <cite>Era</cite>, ditto of two new penny <cite>Sportsmen</cite>, with half
a dozen penmen of the London dailies and weeklies, all seeking pabulum for
their “special correspondence” from the Irish capital. At “the Imperial”
we met an American party, which included John Heenan, his “secretary (!)”
Mr. Hamilton, Cusick, and the literary and artistic representatives of a
New York “illustrated” journal. Here, too, we met our friend Shirley
Brooks (the editor of <cite>Punch</cite>, <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">in posse</span>), looking fair, fresh, and pleasant,
and more resembling a smart Meltonian fresh from “the shires” and
following the brush across a grass country than a London Press-man just
escaped from the consumption of the midnight gas. To him, as one of the
“uninitiated,” we imparted our confidence, that he had better enjoy himself
in the pleasant circles of Dublin society, than set out on any such
“pig-shearing” expedition as the contemplated journey must in all
probability prove.</p>

<p>Monday morning came, and we strolled down Dame Street. We were
quickly hailed by a car-driver, “Would we like jist a dhrive to Monkstown?
Shure an’ Mishter Mace is up there, at the Salt Hill hot-el, he is;
an’ there’s lots o’ gintry as he’s a shtrippin’ an’ showin’ hisself to&mdash;&#8203;shure I seen
him mysilf through an open windy, yesterday marnin’; an’ by the same
token he a-runnin’ a quarter race like a shtag, an’ batin’ his man, a rig’lar
paydesthrian too. Will I dhrive yer hanner?” Yes; but not to Monkstown.
At this moment we were accosted by an old, very old acquaintance, none
other than the erewhile host of the “Blue Boar’s Head,” Long Acre, a
renowned English “paydesthrian,” Drinkwater, better known in sporting
<a name="Page_481" id="Page_481"></a><span class="pageno">481</span>
circles by his alias of “Temperance.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_39" id="fnanchor_39"></a><a href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span>
This worthy relic of a better period
and better men, had been for some years located in the Irish capital, in a
confidential employment in an extensive commercial institution, and, as he
was among the curious, we mounted the jolting jaunting-car, and away we
went for Island Bridge.</p>

<p>The scene here was curious, and quite novel to an English eye. Groups
of people, consisting of men with a large sprinkling of slatternly women
and barefoot children, were thickly scattered on the roads and river-banks,
while vehicles of every description, and some of no possible description,
rattled through the crowds amid cheers, shouts, and now and then objurgations
and cries from the assemblage. Hard by, to complete the oddity
of the picture, stood a squad of active, good-looking, and apparently good-humoured
constabulary, each carrying his handy rifle-carbine and sword-bayonet,
and all seemingly on the best of terms with Paddy and Shelah,
and the “gossoons” who formed the holiday gathering. Making our way
into the house we there found, that though the much-talked-of Goold’s
Cross was the appointed <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">champ clos</span>, that not only was there, up to this
time, no train or other mode of conveyance thither even suggested, but
that the “assembled chiefs” were only about to discuss the nomination of
a referee, as provided by the articles. Had this matter been left to Harry
Brunton on behalf of Mace, and “Ould Nat” as the representative of
Coburn, no doubt that matter would have been quickly and amicably
settled. That this did not suit the “managers” was quickly apparent.
We found a meeting much resembling, on a smaller scale, a Yankee “caucus,”
or an assembly of French communards at Belleville, gesticulating, shouting,
swearing, and all talking at once, while in the midst our deaf friend, Harry
Brunton, Old Nat, Mr. Edwin James, and half a dozen Hibernian amateur
counsellors in vain tried to obtain a hearing. Finally, as nothing could be
done here, an adjournment took place to a more private apartment. Here
the squabble was renewed. For referee, after various names had been
assented to by Brunton and rejected by the Coburn party, the latter
declared, that they would fight under the refereeship of no man but a
certain Mr. Bowler, of Limerick, a person utterly unknown to any one
present, and of whom no one could certify that he had the slightest
acquaintance with the rules of the Ring, or the duties of the office thus
<a name="Page_482" id="Page_482"></a><span class="pageno">482</span>
proposed to be thrust upon him. At this time, too, it was truly reported
that a body of 100 constabulary were posted near Thurles, and that a
man had been just arrested at Goold’s Cross on suspicion that he was
Coburn, who, however, was stated to be safe at a place called Ballangella,
twelve miles from Limerick. Brunton now put his foot down in refusing
the mysterious Mr. Bowler, and as Messrs. James and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> were equally
obdurate, the dispute as to whether <em>either</em> party meant fighting went on
until the clock struck three, when the match, according to the articles, was
actually <em>off</em>. Hereupon Harry Brunton declared his intention of not
trusting his man to the forbearance of the Irish police, and, unless a fair
referee were agreed on, he would wash his hands of the whole affair and
return to England. Harry then left the house, and embarked on board the
Holyhead packet, Mace also leaving at nine o’clock. And now came the
concluding scenes of this Irish comedy. The Coburn clique loudly proclaimed
their intention of claiming the £900 in the hands of the stakeholder.
They would go down to Goold’s Cross&mdash;&#8203;and they did so&mdash;&#8203;and
then and there summon the “runaway” to meet their man. Resolved to
see out the farce, we took tickets. On the platform were a hundred greencoats
armed with carbines; and a ruddy-faced young rustic, whose name
proved to be Ryan, as unlike Mace as could be, having been pointed out
by some practical joker as Mace, was forthwith arrested as the redoubted
English champion, but soon set at liberty. The ring, consisting of four
posts and a rope, having been pitched at a place called Pierstown, Kilmana,
and the police being assured that there being but <em>one</em> man there could be
no fight, stood laughing by, while proclamation for the appearance of the
English champion was made and the stakes duly claimed, and so the curtain
fell.</p>

<p>The scene shifts to England, where the stakeholder, after innumerable
criminations and recriminations, declared “a draw” of the battle-money
by each party as the only possible verdict. Of course the Mace party, and
Harry Brunton especially, were seriously out of pocket by the <em>fiasco</em>, in
travelling, training, and other expenses, beyond the £100 disbursed to
Coburn and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> The editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> thus sums up the case:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Looking at the matter calmly and dispassionately, we are led to think
that Mace has been treated harshly. Of Coburn we have formed this
opinion, that he never had the slightest intention of fighting; that he had
not even trained; that he was a mere instrument in the hands of others,
and believed the match would be turned to account by some trick of
<a name="Page_483" id="Page_483"></a><span class="pageno">483</span>
Yankee juggling, without the peril of exposing his cutwater countenance
to the active props of Mace’s handy digits. Taking the affair as a whole,
it has been one of the greatest and most fatal blows to pugilism within
our memory, and will tend more to estrange and disgust true patrons of
the Ring than any event of our time. We have not heard any more
appropriate name bestowed upon any great disappointment than that
invented by the sporting editor of the <cite>Morning Advertiser</cite>, when he
described the no-result as ‘the collapse of a gigantic wind-bag.’”</p>

<p>While on the subject of the Press, we cannot refrain from a pleasant
episode in relief of so much chicanery and knavery.</p>

<p>No one can deny the native humour of our Irish fellow-countrymen, and
their keen sense of the ridiculous, hence some Irish wag turned this affair
of Mace and Coburn to laughable account. A certain portion of the
“unco’ guid” Puritan and eminently pious Catholic press of Dublin was
loud in its outcries of horror, and its denunciations of the unhallowed incursion
of “fighting men” into the peace-loving “island of saints.” It called
loudly for the strong arm of the law to preserve intact the holy soil, miraculously
cleared by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick, from a renewed invasion of foreign “vermin.”
Some sly wag (the hoax was worthy of Theodore Hook himself)
accordingly indited the following “pastoral” from the Cardinal Archbishop
of Dublin, which, being forwarded to the leading Irish papers, found ready
insertion and approving editorial comment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">

<p>“<span class="sc">Very Reverend Brethren</span>,&mdash;&#8203;My attention has been called by some respectable gentlemen
to a report now widely circulated, that this city, or its vicinity, is to be made the theatre
of a signal combat between two foreign pugilists, who are about to expose their lives to
imminent danger for a certain sum of money. This report must be the subject of great
regret to every one who is imbued with the spirit of Christian charity, and who recognises
in his fellow-man the image of his Creator. It is not necessary for me to call on you to use
all your influence to preserve this Christian country from an exhibition so disgraceful, and
so well calculated to degrade human nature. I shall merely request of you to publish, as
soon as possible, from your altars, that such combats, in which human life is exposed to
danger, are prohibited under the severest penalties by the Holy Catholic Church. Passing
over the decrees of the Council of Trent, it will be sufficient to state that the learned Pontiff
Benedict XIV. excommunicates the principal actors in such fights, their seconds, and all
who encourage them, and all who designedly become spectators of such unworthy scenes.
If you denounce these penalties from the altar I am confident that the faithful of this
diocese, who are so devotedly attached to Holy Catholic Church, and so obedient to its laws,
will listen with contempt to the invitation of those who would implicate them in the misdeeds
of foreign gladiators, and will abstain from countenancing or encouraging anything
condemned by our holy religion, and contrary to the dictates of the Gospel.</p>

<p>The absurdity of the date of this “pastoral,” and the satirical retort on
Lord Lyndhurst’s celebrated speech, in which he characterised the Irish as
“aliens in blood, in language, and religion,” by describing Mace and
Coburn as “foreign gladiators,” might have aroused suspicion. But no;
<a name="Page_484" id="Page_484"></a><span class="pageno">484</span>
with the godly, when they attack the wicked, <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">on fait flêche de tout bois</span>; so
the Puritan and Methodist prints actually praised the anti-combatant
zeal of the Cardinal, and the “pastoral” was reproduced with approbation
in a paper containing two savage assaults&mdash;&#8203;in one of which a man’s nose
was bitten off&mdash;&#8203;and four other outrages of the “foinest pisanthry” with
weapons, in two of which the victims were left senseless and apparently
dead!</p>

<p>That the English newspapers took the hoax <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au sérieux</span> is hardly to be
wondered at, but the two following specimens, one ridiculing, the other
approving, the ingeniously fabricated “pastoral,” are really worth preserving
as curiosities of newspaper literature.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">(From the <cite>Manchester Guardian</cite>, October 5, 1864.)</p>

<p class="center ls">“THE ARCHBISHOP AND THE PUGILISTS.</p>

<p class="center">“<i>To the Editor of the</i> <span class="sc">‘Examiner’ and ‘Times.’</span></p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;&#8203;I perceive from your journal of to-day that Archbishop Paul Cullen has issued
a pastoral to his clergy against the great fight that was to have come off in Ireland, in
which country it is well known that fighting is the very last thing the inhabitants ever
resort to for the settlement of differences. As the men are not going to fight, there will be
little difficulty in obeying the injunction of Cardinal Paul. Had it been otherwise, I am
afraid a few of ‘the faithful’ would have been congregated in the outer ring, and perhaps
some few (who of course could not read or had not read the Pastoral) might have got up
some little independent shindies of their own, even as young buds surrounding the inner red
roses, or noses. But are we quite sure the Archbishop really alludes to the same thing as
we do? He describes the projected fight as between ‘two foreign pugilists.’ Now I understand
Mr. Coburn is not an American, but an Irishman. Mr. Mace is undoubtedly from
Norwich; and although, in a certain sense, that Quaker, crape-weaving city may be described
as <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">in partibus infidelium</span>, yet letters from Limerick to Norwich are not yet forwarded <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</span>
Ostend. I fancy what the Archbishop means is this, that in the case of real native Irishmen&mdash;&#8203;take
the Belfast Catholics and Protestants, for example&mdash;&#8203;fighting could not possibly
occur, and that he wishes to show that only individuals ‘not to the manner born’ could
import so dangerous a custom or practice into that peaceful land. A ‘foreigner’ from
London or from Oldham might possibly come to fisticuffs in the county of Wicklow, but
they would receive no countenance or encouragement from the peace-loving natives, who,
refusing to hold their hats or coats, or to mop off any casual claret, would avert their eyes,
and, like the soldier in the song, ‘wipe away a tear.’ I have no interest in the two persons
called ‘foreigners’ by the Archbishop, but I think in so designating them his Eminence has
administered a severer punishment than the occasion required. I should not like to retort
upon the Archbishop or call my Irish fellow-citizens ‘foreigners’&mdash;&#8203;writing a paragraph
for your journal, for instance, to the following effect&mdash;&#8203;‘Two foreigners, named Dennis
Blake and Patrick O’Rafferty, were brought before Mr. Fowler for fighting in Deansgate.
O’Rafferty, who spoke with a strong foreign accent, said “Blake tould me, plaze yer hannar,
he’d jist bate the soul out o’ me in a brace of shakes, an’ Oi&mdash;&mdash;” Mr. Fowler, “I’ve evidence
enough. You are ’aliens in blood, in language, and in religion”&mdash;&#8203;I am quoting an eminent
jurist&mdash;&#8203;and you must pay a fine of &mdash;&#8203;, or go to prison.’</p>

<p>“It must, however, be a great consolation and relief to the minds of Mr. Mace and Mr.
Bos Tyler that the Archbishop ‘passes over the decrees of the Council of Trent,’ and merely
throws the ‘learned Pope Benedict XIV.’ at their heretic heads. It seems to me that one of
the Pope ‘Bonifaces’ would be more appropriate in a case of ‘pubs,’ and prize-fighters,
for a ‘stinger over the left.’</p>

<p>“‘No good thing is without its attendant evil,’ is a platitude as old, at least, as the time
of Lucretius. Old, however, as it is, and platitude as it has become, it is a truth, notwithstanding.
The intercourse and intercommunion of nations is an undoubted good. It has,
however, we are reminded, its repulsive as well as its attractive aspect. An international
Congress may be useful. International Exhibitions, apart from the boastful self-sufficiency
which attends them, may be good. International Copyright is what all authors sigh for,
and we can even enjoy the noise and bustle of an International Dog Show. We have, however,
advanced beyond this, and have within the last week only barely escaped the disgrace
of another International Prize Fight. Amidst the dearth of political news; the stagnation
of home scandals; and the absence of our chief notabilities from London, if not from
England, Mr. Edwin James&mdash;&#8203;the same person, we presume, who so recently ‘left his country
for his country’s good,’ has sought to manufacture telling paragraphs for newspaper editors
by getting up an International Prize Fight in the sister island.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_40" id="fnanchor_40"></a><a href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span>
Happily for the character
of Ireland, its police, jealous of all fighting save amongst the native element, and with the
lawful and national weapon&mdash;&#8203;the shillelagh&mdash;&#8203;have prevented a repetition of these scandalous
scenes and gatherings; and the English Champion has had to return to London <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">re infecta</span>.
With the squabbles of the would-be combatants and their friends&mdash;&#8203;with the recriminations
of Yankee sharpers and English blackguards, we have nothing to do. We leave the patrons
of the Ring to settle the important question of the stakes among themselves. Nor are we
about to try the patience of our readers with either a defence or an attack upon the immunities
of the Prize Ring. What we desire to chronicle is the worthy attitude assumed by the
Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, who addressed the following letter to the clergy
within his jurisdiction. [The letter will be found elsewhere.] This letter we gladly publish
as worthy of the position of the writer. If successful, as but for an accident it might have
been, it would have afforded an encouragement to the author, as it will be a valuable precedent
to himself and to the rest of his brethren, and will, we have no doubt, lead them to
‘announce’ the same ‘penalties’ of excommunication against the midnight assassin, watching
to take the life of his landlord; so that the pugilist and the hired murderer alike will before
long both be sought for in vain in the peaceful ‘Isle of the Saints.’ With the fact of the
publication of such a document we are too gratified to attempt to cavil at its language.
The emphasis laid on the circumstance that Mace and Coburn were two ‘<em>foreign</em> pugilists,’
and that they were two ‘<em>foreign</em> gladiators,’ seams at first sight a covert way of claiming the
monopoly of fighting for the faithful and non-alien portion of the community, and is hardly
consistent with the fact that one of the would-be combatants was born in the county of
Armagh, which is usually considered a part of Ireland. We have, however, no doubt that
these words, though not literally correct, were judiciously thrown in by the Archbishop, in
order to enlist the patriotism and national feeling of those to whom this letter was addressed,
and with the hope that those Irishmen who might be indifferent to the wishes and orders of
‘Paul Cullen,’ would readily follow the directions of the writer when they were fortified by
the belief that the two invaders of the peace&mdash;&#8203;the two gladiators&mdash;&#8203;were, after all, only
‘foreigners,’ and hence undeserving of the honour of an Irish audience.”</p>

<p>At the “settlement” of accounts&mdash;&#8203;Messrs. James and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, receiving a
cheque of £400&mdash;&#8203;a funny little incident of modern practice oozed out.
Harry Brunton, among other liabilities, had made himself responsible to a
silk-mercer for Mace’s “colours,” and now asked to be reimbursed. In
olden times, when a pugilist distributed his colours, it was with the honourable
understanding, on the part of the recipient, that in the event of
victory the man should receive a guinea (subsequently a “sov.”), and
<em>nothing</em> if he lost. This was the understanding; not as a sale, but, as the
newspapers say of correspondence, “as a guarantee of good faith.” In
modern times, however, as Molière’s <i>Quack Doctor</i> assures <i>Géronte</i>, “<span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nous
avons changé tout cela</span>,” and the gallant and generous dispenser insists on
the prepayment of a guinea&mdash;&#8203;we suppose “as a guarantee of good faith”&mdash;&#8203;on
<a name="Page_486" id="Page_486"></a><span class="pageno">486</span>
the part of his patron. Indeed, we do not see how he could safely do
otherwise, as the looms of Spitalfields and Coventry would hardly suffice to
supply the demands of silk kerchiefs on “a promise to pay,” while the
deposit of a sovereign each (not returnable), for a few dozen of handkerchiefs,
invoice price 5s. 6d., most have a certain consolation in case of a
draw or a lose.</p>

<p>Accounts being squared, Mace, as he said “to clear his character,”
offered to fight Coburn anywhere in England for £100 or “on his own
terms.” Bill Ryall, Joe Goss, Jack Rooke, also, were all “ready to meet
Coburn.” The latter responded that he was ready to fight Mace, in “any
part of Her Majesty’s dominions in America, for £1,000, but not in
England <em>with a mob at his back</em>.” Brunton published a list of Mace’s
backers, “to whom their money had been returned;” a similar document
of the deposits made on behalf of Coburn might have proved a curiosity.
Our sole apology for treating at such length these later doings is, that we
look upon them as the concluding chapter in the downfall of the Ring, and
as the elucidation of a question often put to us, “Do we consider its
revival possible?” to which our reply has uniformly been, “Not only not
possible, but not even desirable; ‘other times, other manners:’ its revival
would be an anachronism.” Yet did the old bull-dog spirit die hard, and
several good battles were contested in the years 1863&ndash;70. In November,
1864, a new big one, Joe Wormald, claimed the Championship, when he
was answered by another big ’un, hight Andrew Marsden. Mace sent forth
a challenge to meet the winner, who proved to be Wormald, who received
the belt. The day of battle was named for November 1, 1865, for £200
and the Championship; but a severe accident disabling Wormald, Mace
received the sum of £120 forfeit.</p>

<p>The year 1866, opened with another “train-swindle.” A second match
“for £200 and the belt” had been got up with Joe Goss, and Tuesday,
May 24th, appointed for its decision. About four hundred tickets having
been disposed of by industrious touting, at two guineas first class, and
£1 10s. 6d. second, the company started at half-past five on the appointed
morning, on “an excursion there and back,” as the card-board expressed it.
At 6h. 13m. we passed Farningham Road, and at 6h. 35m. slackened speed
and disembarked at Longfield Court, near Meopham, Kent, where a ring
was formed, and after the customary ceremonies, Jem Mace and Joe Goss&mdash;&#8203;after
much waiting for the police, who came not&mdash;&#8203;stood up face to face,
at a respectful distance, for the first and only round of the
</p>
<a name="Page_487" id="Page_487"></a><span class="pageno">487</span>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">NO FIGHT.</p>

<p>Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;Mace would not lead off, but
nodded and beckoned to Joe, who, however,
declined his invitation and nodded and grinned
in return, squaring his elbows and stepping
first to right and then to left, in an
ungainly manner, but never trusting himself
within what Mr. Gladstone calls “a measurable
distance” of a knock; Mace, also,
politely preserving an interspace in all his
manœuvres. As minute after minute dragged
on, and it was clear neither man meant to
fight, the referee stepped into the ring, and
warned the men, unless blows were struck he
would declare “a draw.” The announcement
was received with the utmost indifference
by both the principal performers,
who walked about during the discussion,
chafing their arms and breasts with their
hands, and exchanging recognitions with
acquaintances and friends. Again the men
faced each other, and again alternately advanced
and retreated; fifty minutes, one
hour elapsed, and not a blow was struck.
Again and again did the referee remonstrate.
He might as well have “whistled jigs to a
milestone.” At the end of 74 minutes he
leaped into the ring for the last time, and
amidst the laughter and hisses of the spectators,
declared it “a drawn battle;” whereupon
the unscathed gladiators shook hands,
grinned, and put on their clothes, Mace
coolly informing us, that he had “sprained
his ankle severely a few days before,” and
that “he was not fit to fight;” though how
that ensured Goss’s forbearance was left unexplained.
So all returned to town&mdash;&#8203;the
sheep and their shearers.</p>

<p class="center">“Hope springs eternal in the human breast,”</p>
</div><!--end fight-->

<p class="unindent">and so, in the hope of witnessing a fight at last, Mace signed articles once
again for £200, and to ensure that the men should get closer together this
time, a ring of 16 feet was agreed upon. In this, on August 6th, 1866,
Jem Mace displayed indisputable superiority by giving Master Joe an
exemplary beating in 21 rounds, occupying one minute over the half-hour.</p>

<p>The bubble of 1866&ndash;7 was the appearance of a new “Irish giant,”
standing 6 ft. 4½ in., first dubbed O’Baldwin, and afterwards Ned Baldwin&mdash;&#8203;a
name familiar to Ring history. Having beaten one George Iles,
O’Baldwin claimed the belt, and Mace (who had retired) backed “an
Unknown” against him. This “Unknown” Mace afterwards declared to
be Joe Goss; but Mace having got into trouble over a battle between
Holden and Peter Moore, at Derby, and Joe injuring his shoulder in his
Bristol fight with Allen, Mace was allowed (for a consideration) to name
Joe Wormald in his stead, and to postpone the fight for a fortnight, and yet
farther to Saturday, 23rd April, 1867, so as not to clash with the Two
Thousand Guineas Stakes. Will it be believed that 300 persons travelled
that morning by the South Eastern Railway to find that “the Giant” had
somehow mistaken the terminus, and by a misdirection was sitting in a
four-wheeler, doubled up like a pocket-knife, under a dry arch in Tooley
Street, while the special steamed off without him, and so Joe Wormald
received the £200 forfeit?</p>

<p>To console the confiding public, Mace now offered himself to the notice
of O’Baldwin on the usual terms, to meet on October 15th, 1867. The
<a name="Page_488" id="Page_488"></a><span class="pageno">488</span>
£400 was made good, and Jem was ordered from Newmarket, where he
was training, to Woodford, Essex, when it was communicated that the
officers were after him, and he crossed over into Surrey. Here, at Herne
Hill, he was arrested by Sergeant Silverton, of the Metropolitan Police,
together with Pooley Mace, his cousin, brought before Sir Thomas Henry,
at Bow Street, and duly bound over to keep the peace in sureties of £300.
At the examination, Inspector Hannan stated that the tickets were, to his
knowledge, sold at two, three, and four guineas. So each man, as we were
told next week, “drew his stake,” on the ground of “magisterial interference.”
Again Mace had retired, and Joe Wormald being disabled by
illness, O’Baldwin was left, like the Giant Blunderbore, “King of the
Castle.” The reader has already, in this Memoir, had the opportunity of
forming an opinion of the pugilistic pretensions of Sam Hurst, “the Stalybridge
Infant.” Yet Sam Hurst was dragged from his obscurity, and it was
thought a good thing might be made of the <i>gobemouches</i> by a Championship
fight between the giants! This was, however, too utterly preposterous,
and it broke down. In December, 1867, Joe Goss and Wormald
were matched, which ended in a forfeit, and Wormald, O’Baldwin, and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>
were announced as departing for America!</p>

<p>Here, in 1868, as we learn from the Transatlantic journals, Joe Wormald
and the prodigious O’Baldwin were matched “for 2,500 dollars and the
Championship of the World.” They met at Lynnfield, Massachusetts,
when, after a scramble of ten minutes in a single round, the “sheriff and
his merrie men” interfered and stopped further proceedings. Thereafter,
we are told, the “stakeholder having ordered Wormald to renew the
fight,” and he not complying, that functionary handed the money to “the
Irish champion,” a proceeding which, in the words of Lord Dundreary,
“no fellah can understand.” After returning for awhile to England, Mace
sailed for the Antipodes, and by the latest accounts was a prosperous
publican in Melbourne.</p>

<p>Our tale is well-nigh told. In 1870, Jem Mace, being in America, met
Tom Allen for 2,500 dollars a side. They fought near New Orleans, on
May 10th, when Jem polished off the Birmingham bruiser in style in 10
rounds, 44 minutes.</p>

<p>As the design of “<span class="sc">Pugilistica</span>” is to supply a reliable and honest
history of the British Prize Ring and the deeds of its worthies, we shall
here drop the story of New World rowdyism. The Ring had finished its

 The career of Joe Goss shows that even in the last days of its degeneracy the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> had
brave men who would have gone straight, had they not been warped from the direct course of
honesty by knaves who sought only to make the pugilist the instrument of their own nefarious
ends. Goss’s birthplace was the file-making town of Wolverhampton, on the 16th of
August, 1838; and he made his <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</span> at the age of twenty-one, in a battle with Jack Rooke,
of Birmingham, for £25 a side, on the 20th September, 1859. His defeat of Rooke in
1 hour and 40 minutes, after 64 sharp rounds, was a promising first appearance, seeing that
that boxer had recently beaten Tom Lane&mdash;&#8203;brother to the renowned “Hammer” of that
ilk. His next match was with Price, of Bilston, a 12 stone man, who has been often confounded
with Posh Price, of Birmingham&mdash;&#8203;also, at a subsequent period (1862) beaten by Goss. This
battle ended in a forfeit by Goss, he being arrested at the instance of his father when going
to scale, November 9th, 1859. Joe was determined not to be baulked, and at a meeting
between himself and Price, the latter offering to fight him for £10, as a solace for his disappointment,
the money was posted, and the men met on the 10th of February, 1860, near
Wolverhampton. Joe’s activity, power of hitting, and fearless style soon brought his
opponent down to his own weight; and in the short space of 25 minutes, in which 15 rounds
were fought, Price was consummately thrashed. Bodger Crutchley, who was in high
esteem for his victories over George Lane, Sam Millard, Bos Tyler, Smith (of Manchester),
and who had last fought Posh Price a drawn battle (interrupted by the police), was Joe’s
next opponent. They met near Oxford, July 17th, 1860, for £100 a side, when, after a gallant
struggle of 120 rounds, lasting 3 hours and 20 minutes, Goss was hailed the victor. On
September 24th, 1861, Joe met and defeated Bill Ryall, for £50 a side, in 2 hours 50 minutes,
during which 37 tedious and shifty rounds were fought; and on the 11th of February, 1862,
Joe a second time faced Bill Ryall for £100 a side (on the Home Circuit), for <em>three hours
and eighteen minutes</em>, when, as neither man could or would finish, the referee declared “a
draw.” This brings us to his battle with Mace for £1,000, detailed above. On December 16th,
1863, Goss entered the ring with Ike Baker for £100, whose pretensions Joe disposed of in 27
rounds, lasting 80 minutes, the punishment being all on one side. Joe’s next two matches
were defeats by Mace. On March 6th, 1867, Goss was matched for £100 a side with Bill
Allen, of Birmingham. This was a remarkable muddle; after fighting 34 rounds in three
different rings, time inclusive 1 hour and 54 minutes, darkness came on, and “a draw”
was declared. Soon after Allen sailed for America, landing at New York, July 21<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> Joe,
who considered he had been treated unfairly, and robbed of the fair reward of his milling
superiority, followed him, and, notwithstanding his voyage, issued his challenge to
Allen on the 8th of April, six days after his arrival. This was promptly accepted, and the
match made for 5,000 dollars (£1,000), to be fought for on the 7th of September. We need
hardly remind the reader that the Irish newspaper Press of the United States is in the
hands of expatriated Irishmen, whose buncombe and bombast is only exceeded by their prejudice
and ignorance. These worthies magnified the contest into a battle for “the Championship,”
but as Goss had been two and a half times beaten by Mace, and Allen had done
nothing in England beyond drawing the stakes in a forfeit with Posh Price, and failed to
do the same in his draw with Joe Goss, it would puzzle “a Philadelphia lawyer” to know
how this could be a “fight for the Championship of the World,” except of Irish America,
to which title they are both welcome. The “Cincinnati Fight” ended by a “foul” blow,
Tom Allen hitting Goss when on the ground! <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic transit</span>, &amp;c.]</p>

 No doubt many of the weak-kneed brethren, the disciples of a flabby, invertebrate pseudo-humanitarianism,
will feel surprised, if not scandalised, at this claim of Lord Shaftesbury as
a patron of pugilistic practice. His lordship’s Christianity, however, has always been
practical, and of the order called “muscular.” Witness his gallant successful efforts to
emancipate the poor little white slaves in our factories by his glorious Ten Hours Bill, and
other humane legislation&mdash;&#8203;legislation, let it never be forgotten, opposed by John Bright and
the Gradgrind social reformers of the doctrinaire and politico-economical kidney. The friend
and benefactor of the Street Arab, the Shoe Black, and the founder of Ragged Schools bore
outspoken testimony of his admiration of boxing only a few weeks since in a speech at
Exeter Hall, at the Young Men’s Christian Association, wherein he recommended sparring
with the gloves as a gymnastic exercise of high value, and recalled, at eighty years, the days
when he was himself accounted no mean antagonist, and “reckoned a good boxer among
those who were judges of the art.” His style was worthy of a Homeric hero&mdash;&#8203;a Nestor of
the Ring.</p>

 Some who remember “old times” and “the Kentish Town match,” may like to hear

<h4 class="h4head">TOM KING (CHAMPION).<br />
1860&ndash;1862.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> brief history of the last legitimate champion of the British <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> is,
in many respects, a consoling contrast and relief to the chicanery, trickery,
and moral or physical cowardice which marked the “latter-day” professors
of pugilism, and their yet more disreputable and despicable patrons. If
Tom King fell short in scientific attainments and the intuitive fighting gifts
which were so conspicuous in Tom Sayers, Tom Spring, Jem Belcher,
Dan Mendoza, John Jackson, and Tom Johnson, he nevertheless exemplified
through his brief but bright pugilistic career the boldness,
honesty, and fairness which are the accompaniments of true courage; and,
whether winner or loser, won or lost upon his merits.</p>

 <p class="caption">TOM KING (<span class="sc">Champion</span>), 1863.</p>
 <p class ="pneg center"><i>From a Photograph.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Tom King first saw the light on the 14th of August, 1835, in Silver
Street, in the “maritime district” of Stebonheath, or Stepney; an East
London parish in which, by an ancient popular tradition, all children born
on the high seas have their “settlement.” Among the amphibious population
of this region of docks, wharfs, stairs, and jetties, Tom’s earlier days
were passed, and here, with “a brother Tham,” he grew in due time to
the stature of six feet two inches in his stockings, and the weight of twelve
stone and some odd pounds; as active and straight and “pretty a piece of
man’s flesh” as a recruiting sergeant ever cast eyes on, and tempted with the
“Queen’s shilling” to become a bold dragoon or a stately grenadier. But
Tom’s inclination by birth, parentage and education, was all towards “the
sister service,” and at an early age he was a “sailor bold” on board of
one of Her Majesty’s ships. In this capacity he made a voyage to the coast
of Africa, and subsequently another in a trading vessel. On his return
his good conduct and character obtained him a position as foreman of
labourers at the Victoria Docks, and here, among a very rough class of
<a name="Page_491" id="Page_491"></a><span class="pageno">491</span>
fellows, Tom, though a giant in stature, and of the mild behaviour which
so often accompanies size and strength, could not escape insult. In fact,
our hero, instinctively brave, exemplified the wise precept of Laertes’
father:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
   <div class="i2">“&mdash;&mdash;Beware</div>
   <div class="i0">Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,</div>
   <div class="i0">Bear it that th’opposed may beware of thee,”</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="unindent">and so soon found some of the long-shore men who presumed on Tom’s
easy temper and mildness of manner. The mode in which, on one particular
occasion, he disposed of a half-drunken bully, known in Wapping
by the odd nickname of “Brighton Bill,” whose pugnacious propensities
and violence had made him a sort of standing terror to his fellow-labourers,
got quickly noised abroad, and coming to the ears of Jem Ward, who at
this time kept the “George,” in his old quarter of Ratcliffe Highway, the
ex-champion sought him out. The pair were quickly on friendly terms,
and the scientific Jem, after a few trials of the youngster’s quality with the
gloves, in which he quickly perceived the excellent material, in pluck and
good temper, he had to work upon, introduced King to some staunch
patrons of boxing. Hereupon a notification was published early in 1860,
that “’Jem Ward’s big ’un,’ who had never fought in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>,” could be
matched for £50 a side against any comer “catch weight.” Of course
this modest price was utterly beneath the notice of modern <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> professors,
who condescended to nothing less than five hundreds and thousands, or&mdash;&#8203;save
the mark&mdash;&#8203;five thousands and ten thousands when they came to
reckon in dollars. So nobody nibbled at the chance, save one Clamp, of
Newgate Market, who had fought and won a battle in the London Ring, in
October, 1857. A friend of Clamp’s, calling on Jem, posted a “fiver”
on his man’s behalf; but, being of an inquisitive turn, Mr. Clamp presented
himself at Ward’s sparring saloon, being personally unknown, and put on
the gloves, as a casual customer, with the “young sailor.” The result
being a “receipt in full” in a single round, the “fiver” was quickly
forfeited, Mr. Clamp retired from the public gaze, and Tom was again
adrift without an engagement.</p>

<p>As our hero’s fame was principally spread among long-shore men and
“the Salts,” Tommy Truckle, of Portsmouth, found friends to back him
for a trial with “Jem Ward’s big ’un.” Truckle’s local fame in disposing
of dockyarders and fighting “blues” at the great naval port and arsenal
was good, and the £50 a side was duly tabled, November 27th, 1860,
<a name="Page_492" id="Page_492"></a><span class="pageno">492</span>
being the day of battle. King on this occasion was placed by Mr.
Richardson, who became his money-finder in the later deposits, under
George Woody, the trainer, at Mr. Lyon’s, the “White Hart,” Romford.
The “Young ’un” had certainly an alacrity in making flesh, for we were
assured by Woody, that when he took him in hand, he drew all 14 stone;
but that such was his docility and steady determination in training that he
had him down in four weeks to 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> with great improvement in
stamina and activity. Tommy Truckle, a hardy fellow, seemed always in
condition at about 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> but fought at 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, and his 5<abbr title="foot">ft.</abbr> lOin. of
stature seemed long enough for anything. He trained at Portsmouth,
under the watchful eye of George Baker. On this occasion Truckle
started from Mr. Tupper’s “Greyhound,” Waterloo Road, and his colours,
a black kerchief with puce and gold border, seemed to be pretty liberally
taken by his friends. An early morning trip per rail conveyed the
travellers to the water-side, below bridge, where a steam tug was in waiting,
by which the principals and their friends were conveyed to the Kentish
marshes, where a good ring was quickly formed by Fred Oliver and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>,
a large accession of spectators arriving by another tug and numerous row
boats.</p>

<p>On the men entering the ring, King being first to show, they were
warmly greeted; King being attended by Jem Mace (then called the
“coming Champion”) and William Richardson; while Truckle was
waited on by Bob Travers (the Black) and Walker, of Stony Stratford.
King, who had completed his toilette long before his opponent, whose boots
seemed to give great trouble, loomed large as he walked about enveloped
in a rug, until, the word being given, Truckle stood up, and King,
throwing away his blanket and stripping off his under shirt, displayed a
bust and general figure which surprised and delighted his partisans.
Truckle, when stripped, looked small and somewhat stale, though hardy
and resolute, as he confronted the youthful and symmetrical giant.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;As the men stood face to face
King looked the pink of condition, and not
only did he stand over Truckle, but his
attitude was decidedly the more artistic and
unconstrained. Truckle stood firmly, his
left well out, and his right fore arm covering
the mark, so that there was little of the
novice in his position. Both men seemed
anxious to begin work, and manœuvred in
and out when after a few offers on each
side, they mutually stepped back, looked
earnestly at each other and rubbed their
arms. King threw up his hands and advanced,
when Truckle cleverly propped him
with the left flush in the nose, and drew the
carmine. (Cheers, and “first blood for
Truckle.”) King again stepped in, and
this time got home us right a sounder on
Truckle’s ribs, when Truckle got away
and down.
</p>
<a name="Page_493" id="Page_493"></a><span class="pageno">493</span>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Each sparred for an opening. Truckle
feinted and tried to draw the Young’un,
but it was no go. King smiled and shook
his head. Exchanges: Truckle on King’s
neck, while, on getting near, King again
visited Truckle’s ribs a sounder. Truckle,
in trying to get back, slipped, but recovering
himself, closed, when King, weaving away,
fought Truckle clean through the ropes in
his own corner.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;As yet little mischief was done on
either side, and on coming up each man
eyed his opponent confidently. After
sparring and manœuvring a bit, each trying
to find a weak point in his adversary’s
defence, Truckle broke ground and retreated,
King boldly following him step by step,
when Truckle sent in his left at King’s
drinking fountain, which at once answered
with a crimson spurt; King, without a
check, delivered his right sharply on
Truckle’s head, and down went the Portsmouth
hero; a sort of staggering fall.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;On coming to the call of “Time,”
Truckle’s left daylight seemed to have a
half shutter up. After some rather pretty
sparring, Truckle tried his left, which was
neatly stopped by King, amidst some applause;
the next moment the Young’un
let go both hands straight as a dart, visiting
Truckle’s kissing and olfactory organs with
a one, two, which tapped the homebrewed
copiously. Again he invested on Truckle’s
left ear with the right in a heavy exchange,
and bored Truckle down in the hitting at
the ropes.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Truckle came up bleeding from nose
and mouth, and some sparring took place
for position, the sun shining brightly in
King’s face. They, however, soon got
together, Truckle leading off, and getting
his left on to King’s mouth, inflicting a cut
on his lower lip, which compliment the
Young’un returned by another crack on the
left listener, which was also cut, and the
Portsmouth man found his way to grass in
a hurry. (7 to 4 on King.)</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Truckle, first to the scratch, led off,
but was short; King went in with both
hands, and Truckle fell on both hands and
one knee, looking up at King, laughingly;
it was a bid for a “foul,” but “no go,” as
King withheld his hand, nodded, and
walked away to his corner, amidst applause.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;A very short round. King, as soon
as his man faced him, let go both hands,
which alighted heavily on Tommy’s cheekbone
and kissing-trap, and Truckle went
down to escape a repetition of the dose.
(2 to 1 on King.)</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;After a short spar the men rushed to
a close, embraced, and Truckle tried to
bring his man over. He did not succeed,
for King shifted his hold and threw him.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Both up together, when King cleverly
ducked his head aside, and avoided Truckle’s
left, then rushed to a close, during which he
administered some rib-roasters to his adversary’s
corpus, and ended by throwing
him cleverly, not, however, without getting
some sharp half-arm punches about the head
and body from the Portsmouth man’s busy
right.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;The fighting had up to this time been
unusually fast for big ones, yet both were
active and spry as ever. King went to his
man resolutely, and after two or three exchanges
with little attempt at stopping,
Truckle went down, King standing over
him.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;King seemed determined to give his
opponent scant breathing-time. No sooner
was he at the scratch than he went across
the ring, and let go both mauleys on his
man’s <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">os frontis</span>, who slipped down at the
ropes.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Truckle popped his left sharply on
King’s peeper as he came on; King immediately
closed, and tried to get on the
lock, but Tommy slipped through his
hands, and was on the grass. (18 minutes
only to these 12 rounds.)</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;King’s left came in contact with the
left side of Truckle’s knowledge-box.
Tommy retorted on King’s mouth, but
next moment went down with a flush hit on
the forehead, falling partly by his own
consent.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Tommy short with his left, when
King measured him and dropped his right,
a wax melter on his man’s left auricular,
which was already badly swollen. In the
close both were down side by side. This
was the first time, as yet, that King had
measured his six foot length on the ground.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;King, who had certainly been making
all the fighting, seemed a little blown, as
they sparred for a few seconds, and Truckle
feinted with the left; King once again got
on a rattler on Tommy’s nob, and Truckle
got down. (An appeal was made to the
referee, that the Portsmouth man had fallen
without a blow, but the fiat was “Fight
on.”)</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Good counter-hits. King on the side
of the brain-pan with his right; Truckle on
King’s forehead, raising a visible bump.
The men closed, when King forced Truckle
down. (Some confusion, and a cry of
“Police.” It was a false alarm.)</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;King got home his left on Truckle’s
mazzard. Truckle rushed to an embrace
and seized King round the waist, but he
could not throw him, and got down without
harm on either side.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;King first at the mark. Truckle
sparring, tried his left, but, as usual, was
short. King avoided Truckle’s second
delivery by throwing his head aside, caught
Tommy on the ribs, and the Portsmouth
man got down somehow.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;King with the left on the mark, and
the right on the jaw, received two ineffective
returns. Truckle slipped on his knees
and hand, and looked up as if expecting a
“foul,” but the blow was not delivered.
</p>
<a name="Page_494" id="Page_494"></a><span class="pageno">494</span>

<p>     20&ndash;28.&mdash;&#8203;Similar in character, except that
King twice threw Truckle.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;King got twice on to Truckle’s head,
whose returns were wild and ineffective.
(Another appeal on Truckle’s style of getting
down. “Fight on,” was the renewed
order.)</p>

<p>     30&ndash;40.&mdash;&#8203;Of similar character. More than
one appeal from King’s umpire, but disallowed.
Truckle receiver-general, and
apparently getting more and more “abroad”
in each succeeding round.</p>

<p>     41.&mdash;&#8203;Truckle game as a pebble, but without
a chance of turning the tide of battle;
King hit Truckle so sharply on the ivories
that he drew a fresh supply of Chateau
Margaux, and Tommy fell as if shot.</p>

<p>     42&ndash;47.&mdash;&#8203;King strong and fresh; Truckle
sinking under repeated doses of punishment;
in the last-named round King hit poor
Tommy clean off his feet with the right
hand. “Take him away;” but Tommy
refused to strike his colours, and came up
for Round</p>

<p>     48.&mdash;&#8203;When the Young’un sent him to grass
with a right-hander on the jaw. Still he
would come again for Round</p>

<p>     49, and last.&mdash;&#8203;As Tommy stood at the
scratch, in a somewhat puzzled condition,
King dropped into him left and right,
which brought Truckle forward. His head
came against King’s cranium with some
force, and Truckle immediately saluted his
mother earth. George Matthison, who was
one of Truckle’s backers, here stepped into
the ring and, by consent of Tommy’s
seconds, threw up the sponge, as his man
had not the remotest chance of winning.
King was accordingly hailed the winner of
this hard-fought battle after a bustling contest
of one hour and two minutes.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;There was but one opinion
on both sides, that, for novices, both men
had acquitted themselves in a first-rate
manner. King is undoubtedly the finest
made young fellow it has been our lot to
behold for many a long day. He is, in our
opinion, far finer and more symmetrical in
frame than Heenan, not being so clumsily
legged as the Yankee Champion, and his
weight (ordinarily 12<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 12<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>) more proportionately
distributed; and we cannot
help thinking, if ever they should come
together (and it is reported that Heenan
challenges the belt) that our “novice” is
just the sort of man to give a good account
in a passage of arms with that redoubtable
and over-boasted gentleman. King does
not use his left in leading off, as more
practised pugilists do, but that is a fault he
has full time to amend, and as his pluck,
endurance and presence of mind, seconded
by undebauched wind and a fine constitution,
were fully demonstrated in this trial,
we do not know where to look for his master.
Throughout the battle the Young’un
behaved in the most manly manner, refusing
to fall on his antagonist on several occasions,
when he had clearly the right to do so, and
resisting the temptation to deliver a blow,
though sorely provoked by his opponent’s
shifty getting down. Truckle has little
pretensions to science; but is a rough and
ready fighter. It must be admitted that,
from the first round to the last, he tried his
utmost to get a turn in his favour, but was
overmatched and outfought at all points.
His friends must have been satisfied that he
only succumbed to a superior man in all
respects, and then only when nature could
do no more. A subscription for the beaten
man was collected on the spot by the
winner, which was added to at the giving
up of the stakes. King exhibited on the
following Monday night, at the Rotunda,
Blackfriars Road, at Tom Paddock’s
benefit (after the latter’s defeat by Sam
Hurst), showing but trifling marks of his
recent encounter.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Early in 1861, there was much tall talk of a match with Heenan, whose
intention of returning to England and claiming the championship from
Sam Hurst, the holder of the new belt, was loudly boasted, but all ended,
as it had begun, in mere talk.</p>

<p>The tough and gallant Harry Poulson, of Nottingham, was proposed as
a competitor, and articles were signed in February, to fight for £100 a side,
May 23rd being fixed for the encounter, and £12 a side posted; but the
backers of the veteran Harry took second thoughts, and at the second deposit
(of £20) failed to put in an appearance, and King pocketed the forfeit.</p>

<p>After the defeat of Sam Hurst by Jem Mace, King lost no time in challenging
the new champion, for the “regulation stake” of £200 and the
belt, which trophy had been duly handed over by Hurst to the stakeholder.
<a name="Page_495" id="Page_495"></a><span class="pageno">495</span>
A match with Young Broome, however, intervened, and came off in
October, the championship battle being fixed so far forward as January 31,
1862.</p>

<p>Of the way in which the Ring, even when the Championship itself was
involved, was made subservient to the quackery of benefit gaggery, the
puffery of the Circus, and the gobemoucherie of the gaping rustics and
sightseekers, the following from a leading contemporary sporting paper will
show:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The deposit this week of £15 a side, making £130 a side down, was
duly posted yesterday, and another of like amount must be staked on Friday
next. The big event for the belt does not excite much interest, from
the fact of the Young Big’un (King) having a previous engagement with
Wm. Broome (Young Evans), on the issue of which, we need hardly say,
must rest his claim as a competitor for the belt and its contingent honours.
Young King, we can say, is taking every care of himself for the approaching
encounter. Jem Mace is still starring it in the provinces with Pablo
Fanque’s circus, but on Monday week he will re-appear in one of his
superior qualifications at Birmingham, he having matched himself to run
ten miles within the hour for a bet of £100 to £50, on Monday week,
Oct. 21<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> The ex-champion, Tom Sayers, we are informed, has also entered
into business on his own account as a circus proprietor, having
bought (?) the three well-known circuses, including Messrs. Howe and
Cushings’, and Jem Myers’s Great American Circus (!). Tom intends commencing
his tour this day, <abbr title="et cetera, et cetera, et cetera">&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</abbr>,” [We omit the rest of the “gag.”]
“Mr. Edwin James (not the Q.C.), a New York gentleman, called at our
office on Wednesday last, immediately after his landing, and informed us
that, owing to the war, business is almost at a dead standstill in the United
States; nevertheless, J. C. Heenan, the gallant competitor of Sayers, is
driving a lucrative trade in his profession (?). Heenan repudiates the fulsome
praises of himself and the absurd tirades against Sayers inserted in several
of our Transatlantic contemporaries.”</p>

<p>To return to the “trial fight” between Young King and William Evans
(known as Young Broome), which came off on Monday, October 21st,
1861, on a spot not far from where the International Contest was left undecided
in 1860, we may say, in partial contradiction of our quotation, that
there was a lively interest in pugilistic circles, whether “a line” could
not be drawn from the event as to the capabilities of the “Novice” to
wrest the laurel from the brow of the scientific Jem Mace. Immediately
<a name="Page_496" id="Page_496"></a><span class="pageno">496</span>
after the match was made King was placed under the fostering wing of Nat
Langham, who took him out of town, and placed him at Tom Salter’s,
“The Feathers,” at Wandsworth, where he had the combined advantages
of the river and the road, and from time to time the preceptorship of
“Ould Nat” in imparting “wrinkles” from his own practical experience.
His walking and rowing exercises were carefully superintended by John
Driver, and the condition of King was a credit alike to himself and his
trainer.</p>

<p>We must here devote a paragraph to the boxer who was thought good
enough to risk 50 <abbr title="sovereigns">sovs.</abbr> and expenses upon, as a “trial horse” for Young
King.</p>

<p>William Evans (whose Ring alias was “Young Broome”) was born in
August, 1836, stood 5 feet 10 inches, and, on this occasion, weighed
11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 2<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> He had fought twice before in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr>&mdash;&#8203;<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, with a gentleman
of colour, called Kangaroo, whom he defeated, for £15 a side, 18 rounds,
30 minutes, down the river, on March 13, 1858. He next fought and beat
Tom Roberts, for £25 a side, in 30 rounds, 50 minutes, down the river.
He afterwards received £10 forfeit from Tyson, who could not get to
weight; and £10 forfeit from Joe M’Gee; but, on the other hand, forfeited
£10 to Joe Goss. Young Broome, having expressed a depreciatory
opinion of King’s pugilistic capabilities, and finding some friends who shared
his views, challenged the Young One to fight at catch-weight for £50, which
was accepted, and Broome, after getting his patrons to rally round him,
went to train at Mr. Packwood’s, the “Boileau Arms,” Hammersmith
Bridge, at that time weighing about 13<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr>, which bulk was reduced by
hard work to 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 2<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> Dando, the well-known trainer of Tom Paddock,
looked after Broome, and most certainly did his duty to his man. Alec
Keene had the management of Broome, who showed the night previous to
the fight at the “Three Tuns,” Moor Street, Soho, from which he took his
departure in the morning.</p>

<p>There was but little betting on the event, only a few speculations being
made at 2 to 1 on King. A very early hour was arranged for the departure,
which was made from London Bridge with unusual quietness and
absence of bustle; and, after a pleasant trip by rail over about sixty
miles of ground, by no means in a direct line, a spot was found in the
county of Surrey fit for the amusement. No time was lost in the ring
being formed, by Fred Oliver and assistants, when Broome was the first to
throw in his cap, attended by a well-known retired pugilist, and Bob
<a name="Page_497" id="Page_497"></a><span class="pageno">497</span>
Travers. King quickly followed suit, with Joe Phelps and Bos Tyler as
his attendants. As both parties meant business, the referee was quickly
chosen, and the colours tied to the stake, Broome sporting a salmon-coloured
handkerchief, with a narrow magenta stripe and border, for his
flag. King had for his standard a chocolate handkerchief, with white, blue,
and yellow lozenge, and blue border. During the progress of the toilets
of the men, a large number of the neighbouring farmers and gentry assembled
on horseback, and, altogether, the gathering was of a superior order.
The ring was well kept by Billy Duncan, the P.B.A. Inspector, assisted by
Young Shaw, Tom Paddock, and Dan Collins. At length, all the preliminaries
having been arranged, the men stood up at 9h. 44min. for</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p>Round 1.&mdash;&#8203;King was, of course, the first
to attract the eye of the <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognoscenti</span>, and his
condition was immediately a moot point,
many, who are by no means bad judges,
stating that he was some pounds too heavy;
while others thought that he was in very
good trim, but no doubt without the polish
which could have been shown had his
finishing touch been given by a first-rate
proficient. As King placed himself in attitude,
his commanding height showed to
great advantage, while the free play of his
shoulders and arms indicated that, whatever
artistic skill he might be deficient in, still
there was propelling power sufficient to
compete with a greater amount of <em>talent</em>
than was generally credited to his opponent.
The Young’un certainly exhibited a wide
spread of shoulder, combined with great
development of the muscles on the back;
his chest well arched, showing that there is
plenty of room for the play of his lungs
when in work; his loins are rather narrow,
while his legs are worthy the proportions of
the upper part of his frame. His attitude
was very erect, his right hand well across
his chest, and the left well advanced, but
low. Young Broome looked, in comparison,
small, but, on scanning his proportions, a
great amount of power could be discovered
in the muscles, which stood out fairly
developed, each as sharply defined as in an
anatomical study. His attitude was rather
stiff, with the left well in front, but with no
forcible action, the position of the right
rather showing a determination for mischief
with that weapon. The way in which
Broome stood as he sparred, prepared the
spectators for an exhibition of “trotting,”
of which they were most pleasingly disappointed.
No time was lost in sparring,
for, both being in the mind for serious
business, hostilities were commenced at
once, by King getting close to Broome
and feinting with his left, but Broome was
“wide oh,” and got out of danger. Broome,
who was more than eager, dashed his left at
the head, but, in consequence of his great
hurry, he was short. King, who would be
busy, got his left fairly on the front of
Broome’s head, receiving on the chest.
This led to good exchanges, in which both
fought very last, until Broome went down.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;On time being called Broome came up
first, amidst the cheers of his friends, who
were taken by surprise at his cleverness in
avoiding punishment. King, who appeared
determined to finish the affair off-hand,
went straight to his opponent, who, nothing
loth, met him, and they fought right and
left with both hands, King getting well on
the nose and forehead, Broome landing on
the chest and neck, the “pepper-box”
being freely handed from one to the other.
This bout was finished by Broome getting
to close quarters, when King picked him up
in his arms, and by sheer strength threw
him, after a good struggle, and fell upon
him.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Both came up piping when time was
called; nevertheless, they commenced as
soon as they were within distance by right
and left deliveries, Broome getting fairly on
to King’s neck and forehead; King delivering
his left on the nose and jaw; Broome
getting his left on the neck heavily, grazing
the skin and drawing the blood. King at
the same time landing his left on Broome’s
forehead, made the first event (first blood)
equal. They then closed, and exchanges
took place until Broome went to grass.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;As Broome came up, the effects of the
blow delivered by King upon his forehead
were very apparent, there being a lump with
a cut, while King had his right cheek and
chest flushed. Broome, who evidently
thought he had only to go in and win,
fought very fast, which tactics met the ideas
of the candidate for the championship, for
they fought furiously with both hands,
<a name="Page_498" id="Page_498"></a><span class="pageno">498</span>
until Broome was knocked down by a right-hander
on the jaw. The quick fighting that
had taken place, and the eagerness of the
combatants, can be well explained by stating
that the time occupied in the four rounds
was only four minutes.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, who appeared to have had
the worst of the previous round, came up
smiling, and, in point of fact, forced the
fighting by leading off with his left at the
head, which was rendered ineffective by
King getting home with his left on the nose.
This brought on some heavy exchanges
with both hands, King getting well on the
forehead and nose, receiving on the chest
and cheek until they got to the ropes, where
the same tactics were pursued until they
closed, when King proved himself much the
stronger man, as he picked up Broome, and,
after a short struggle, threw him, landing
his right on the chest as Broome fell.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;When time was called, both came up
with a determination to settle the matter
“off-hand,” which was evident from the
manner in which rapid exchanges were delivered
on both sides. King landed his
mauleys on the nose, forehead, and right
ear; Broome getting well on the cheek and
chest twice, and falling from the force of
his own blow at the finish.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;Both were blowing as they left their
seconds’ knees; nevertheless, the game was
kept alive by their simultaneously delivering
their left on the face and chest, King having
the best of the exchanges. Broome missed
a couple of well-intended right-handers, for
which mistakes he was fought down, after
a good rally.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;The same tactics were pursued as in
the previous rounds, the right and left
exchanges being of the same character.
Broome, after breaking away, got his right
on King’s jaw twice, steadying the rush of
the “big ’un,” who reached Broome’s forehead
with his right. This forced a rather
wild rally, in which King missed one or
two well-intended shots with the left.
Broome, who got on a right-hander on the
forehead, fell from the force of his own
blow.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, who was first up, was blowing
very freely, and had a cut on the left eyebrow.
King had no prominent mark, with the exception
of his right cheek being slightly
swelled. No time was lost in sparring, for
they commenced proceedings as soon as they
met. Both being eager for work, they
closed, and some fast and wild exchanges
took place, Broome getting on the cheek and
forehead, King on the nose and cheek; they
then closed, and after a short struggle,
were down side by side.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;The equal fighting of the previous
round had decidedly roused the energies of
both, as they missed their first deliveries,
being too eager to get on. On steadying
themselves they countered neatly with the
left, Broome getting upon the cheek, but
King more effectively on the nose. Broome,
who was determined to make the pace good,
tried to land his right twice, but without
avail, getting at the third attempt on King’s
neck, who retaliated by sending his left on
Broome’s nose; the latter hit out at a venture
with his right, which reached the side
of King’s head, and Broome went down
rather suspiciously from the “wind” of
King’s right hand.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;No sooner were the opponents at the
scratch than they commenced proceedings
by countering with the left flush on the
front of the head, after which King got his
left on the cheek; Broome, in retaliation,
sent his left on the jaw, and popped his
right under the left eye. Exchanges followed,
in which King proved himself the
stronger by forcing Broome down in his
own corner.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Broome was first up, and as King
faced him, took the initiative by leading off
with his left, which was rather short,
landing on the chest. King, who was equally
eager to try conclusions, rushed in, delivered
a couple of heavy blows on the nose
and shoulder, receiving a right-hander on
the forehead, a left ditto on the cheek,
which was followed by Broome delivering
a fair smack with the right on the eye,
which forced King backward against the
ropes. (Offers to take 7 to 4 that Broome
would prove the winner.)</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, when time was called, came
up bleeding from the cut under the eye,
administered in the previous bout, but,
nothing loth, met King with great determination,
and, both being equally bent upon
mischief, the exchanges which took place
were wildly delivered, until they closed,
when Broome twisted King off his legs,
who, nevertheless, was uppermost when
they reached the ground.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Both again eager, were up on time
being called; King showing with a lump
on his cheek, which was open under the left
eye; Broome had his nose sadly out of
shape and his forehead swelled. No time
was lost in sparring, each commencing by
sending out his left, and each missing from
over impetuosity. Broome, who tried his
left and missed, got down cleverly.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;This round was remarkable for the
quickness of the exchanges, both getting it
on the head and chest. When they closed,
King held Broome by sheer strength, and
got on his right three times, twice on the
nose and forehead, and the third time on the
shoulder. King stumbled against the stakes,
and Broome went down.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;This round was commenced by each
sparring for wind, King putting his hands
down and walking round the ring. Broome,
who was advised by his seconds to force the
fighting, went to work resolutely, got his
left well on the mouth, catching it in return
on the nose. He, nothing daunted, rushed
in, and got his right on the cheek, then
<a name="Page_499" id="Page_499"></a><span class="pageno">499</span>
fell, apparently from the force of his own
blow.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;A cry that the police were coming
was raised, and both men being confident
and eager to settle the business, they commenced
by delivering counters on the eye
and nose, which led to exchanges at close
quarters, Broome receiving on the nose,
King having one on the same spot&mdash;&#8203;“a hot
’un.” This stirred the Young One up, and
he sent his right straight on the mark,
Broome planting in return on the cheek.
They then closed, and some very heavy exchanges
took place, Broome twice visiting
King’s head, but not heavily, while King,
who was very busy, planted his left between
the eyes, cutting to the bone, then taking
hold of Broome, he delivered three straight
right-handers nearly on the same spot, and
Broome was eventually fought down.
Twenty minutes.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>The alarm of the arrival of the police was now realised. Several of the
county blues appeared at the ring side, but were waiting orders from their
superiors, who had not kept pace with them. The men and seconds
skedaddled from the ring, and the spectators moved off. They passed across
the border of the county, and there the attentive escort left them. In
twenty minutes after, as this invasion was unexpected, a ring was formed
in a retired spot, and at half-past ten the men were in position for</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE RENEWED FIGHT.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Round 18.</span>&mdash;&#8203;On the men again appearing,
Broome had his nose strapped with a bit of
adhesive plaster, his mouth was swelled,
and his left eye discoloured. King had his
jaw swelled, and a cut beneath his left eye;
but seemed as strong as at the commencement.
Broome, who still looked confident,
commenced the proceedings by leading off
with his left at the head, getting it on the
nose in return. This led to exchanges, both
delivering heavily on the head and chest,
until Broome was fought down in his own
corner.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;King came up with alacrity, and
commenced proceedings by planting his left
on the sore spot, receiving on the forehead.
Broome succeeded in planting his left on
the cheek and neck, receiving some heavy
returns on the nose and right ear, and was
finally fought down at the ropes.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;The battle from this time took a decided
turn in favour of King, who, notwithstanding
the pace at which they had been
fighting, was as fresh as at the beginning of
the battle. Broome, who was suffering
from repeated visitations on the nose, tried
all he could to turn the tables, but without
avail, as, on his forcing the fighting, King
hit him away; and notwithstanding all the
left-hand visitations of Broome, succeeded
in delivering severe right and left blows;
the round was concluded by King knocking
down Broome with a right-hander on
the jaw.</p>

<p>     21&ndash;30.&mdash;&#8203;The fighting in these rounds
was of precisely the same character; notwithstanding
all the game and determined
efforts of Broome, who never at any time
flinched, and in several instances surprised
his backers and the spectators by the manner
in which he struggled against the fate,
which, though slowly, was surely declaring
against him. In the last of these rounds
Broome tried to get away from the repeated
visitations of King, and cleverly slipped
him; but King followed him closely, and
finally knocked him down with the right.
Time in the second ring, fourteen minutes.</p>

<p>     31.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, as game as man could be,
came up bleeding from the cut on the nose,
and with his ears much swelled from the
blows administered by King, who had few
marks except some red patches on the
ribs and shoulders, and the left eye nearly
closed. Notwithstanding the punishment
Broome had received, he persevered to turn
the tables, and met the determined onslaught
of King as well as he was able. It
was evident at this time that his (Broome’s)
left hand was going or gone, as he several
times gave his head in an attempt to bring
the battle off in his favour by a cross-counter
with the right. King forced the fighting,
and some good exchanges took place in
favour of King, who, after a spirited rally,
fought Broome down.</p>

<p>     32&ndash;34.&mdash;&#8203;The same tactics were displayed
by both opponents, King, now by far the
stronger man, forcing the fighting as fast as
he could, and the seconds of Broome sending
him up to fight, knowing that it was
only a matter of time, unless their man
could land the victory by an accident This
he most strenuously endeavoured to do by
getting his right on the jaw; but King
bored Broome down in each round until the
34th, when Broome landed his right on the
temple, which staggered King, who fell on
his knees.</p>

<p>     35.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, who came up resolutely, but
<a name="Page_500" id="Page_500"></a><span class="pageno">500</span>
weak, met the rush of King with great determination,
but was, as before, the chief
recipient of the punishment. His left hand
could not be administered with effect;
nevertheless, he closed, and, after a good
rally at the ropes, threw King, but not
heavily.</p>

<p>     36.&mdash;&#8203;The cheers and encouragement given
to Broome, as he came up, had decidedly
nettled King, for, the instant he had left
his second’s knee, he rushed to close
quarters, and, despite all the efforts of
Broome, fought him down at the ropes.</p>

<p>     37.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, who came up slowly, was
bleeding from the cut between the eyes,
which were fast closing, and, with his mouth,
much swelled. Despite his weakness he was
resolute, and did not flinch from the onslaught
of his opponent, who sent his left
on to the old spot. Broome sent in his right
well upon the ribs, but King, not to be
stalled off, bored in, and fought Broome
down in the latter’s corner. Time in second
ring, twenty minutes.</p>

<p>     38.&mdash;&#8203;Broome came up this round apparently
better than heretofore; he was
quicker on his legs than in the last eight
rounds. King rubbed his ribs as he came
up, and, getting within reach, rushed to
close quarters, when some very heavy hitting
took place; King fighting at the head,
and Broome at the body. On breaking
away, Broome landed his left on King’s
nose, for which he was fought down at the
ropes, despite all his endeavours to “hold
his own.”</p>

<p>     39.&mdash;&#8203;Broome, in this round, slightly revived
the failing hopes of his friends, as, on
King missing his left, he planted his left
neatly on Tom’s nose, and his right immediately
afterwards on the jaw, King dropping
on his knees.</p>

<p>     40.&mdash;&#8203;It was but a transient gleam of hope.
Despite the turn in his favour in the last
round, it was apparent that Broome was
fast falling weak from exertion and loss of
blood. The seconds of King, seeing the state
of the case, cried out to him “to go in and
win,” and he fought Broome down in his
own corner.</p>

<p>     41&ndash;43, and last.&mdash;&#8203;In each of these rounds
Broome only came up to be hit down. In
the last but one he was knocked down as he
came game, but staggering, to meet his
opponent. In the last, King walked straight
to Broome’s corner, as the latter retreated
before him, and, delivering a spank on the
head, Broome fell forward on his face. His
seconds, finding it was useless to prolong
the contest, threw up the sponge in token
of his defeat, Young King being hailed the
conqueror, after fighting forty-two minutes
in the two rings.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;The resolute and unflinching
manner in which this splendid contest was
carried out from start to finish, invested the
forthcoming encounter for the Championship
with greater interest. The manner in
which King put up with the right-handed
deliveries of Broome (which were by no
means light), raised him in the estimation
of all who witnessed the fight, and already
speculation on that event has commenced.
King has improved in his fighting greatly
since his encounter last autumn with
Truckle, of Portsmouth, and no doubt he
has learned a lesson or two in this encounter
with Broome. He is too impetuous in his
rushes, in one of which he got the cut under
the left eye, as well as several right-hand
props, which at all times are dangerous, a
chance blow having, in many instances,
brought off a battle when all chance was
apparently gone. That he is thoroughly
game there can now be no question, and his
steadiness in training, <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> is a certain proof
that he will in the eventful contest for the
Championship be as fit as man can be possibly
trained. Young Broome, although defeated,
is by no means disgraced, and his
friends, to a man, are satisfied with his performance,
which has taken even his warmest
admirers by surprise. Rumours had been
flying about respecting Broome’s gameness,
and he having heard of the same, stated his
determination to be game on this occasion;
that he most faithfully kept his word, a
perusal of the above account must prove.
After the sponge had been thrown up,
Broome was carefully attended to by his
seconds, but, notwithstanding all their
attention, he soon became blind. On reaching
the first convenient domicile, he was put
to bed, when, despite the usual remedies,
he was attacked with a severe fit of cold
shivers, which could not be subdued for some
time. At a late hour of the afternoon he
was recovered sufficiently to take his departure
for town, where, on his arrival, he met
with a hearty reception. His friends expressed
their intention to pay him for his
colours the same as if they were winning
ones, and a benefit was arranged for as a
solace for his defeat. King left for town at
an earlier period than his opponent, and
passed the evening amidst his friends at the
east end, but little the worse for the encounter.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>Both Broome and King rapidly recovered from the effects of their
battle, Broome being able to visit Aldershot, on the Thursday, with
Alec Keene. He was also present at the deposit for the Championship,
which took place on Thursday, when he received some substantial recompense
for his gamely contested fight.
</p>
<a name="Page_501" id="Page_501"></a><span class="pageno">501</span>

<p>The stakes were given up to King on the ensuing Tuesday, at Joe
Phelps’s, the “Blakeney’s Head,” High Street, Islington, when a few
admirers of Tom King ventured to lay evens on their pet for the great
event in perspective; though 5 and even 6 to 4 was the price in the east
as in the west.</p>

<p>King trained for the great encounter at Hastings, Mace near Norwich;
the latter coming to town to be present at the fight between Bob Brettle
and Jack Rooke, on the 31st December, 1861, for £200 a side and a bet
of £300 even,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_41" id="fnanchor_41"></a><a href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span>
the moderate sum of £1,000 being dependent on the issue.</p>

<p>“Time and tide speed on their course, and wait for no man,” and the
month of January, 1862, had reached its 28th day, when, on as cheerless
and miserable a winter’s morning as combined damp, drizzle, mizzle, snow,
sleet, and marrow searching cold could mix up, our bold aspiring young
sailor met the practised and scientific Norwich boxer. How his “greenness,”
despite his gameness, fell before superior skill, tact, and experience,
may be found fully set forth in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>As we have already said, there was one person, and that one a most
important factor in the question, who thought he was beaten by an
accident&mdash;&#8203;his name was Tom King. Tom maintained, without any
intention of disparaging for one moment the credit due to Mace for his
skill and also his courage, that he felt convinced, if his friends would stand
to him, he should be able to reverse the first verdict, or, at any rate, he
would then acknowledge that Mace was the better man.</p>

<p>After the long and undecided battle between Joe Goss and Ryall, Goss
was brought forward by his Wolverhampton backers, as a competitor with
Mace for the belt. In April also, “the Benicia Boy” arrived from
America, bringing with him a brother “Jem,” who was said by some Yankee
paragraphists to have come “to pick up the belt.” We have already
noted, in our life of Mace, that Heenan repudiated this newspaper bounce;
and here, to avoid repetition, the reader is referred to the memoir of Mace
for the circumstances under which the second match between King and
Mace was brought about and carried to a conclusion.</p>

<p>Mace, at the time the articles were signed, was making hay after the
<a name="Page_502" id="Page_502"></a><span class="pageno">502</span>
manner of Tom Sayers, in travelling with an equestrian circus&mdash;&#8203;that being
the only ring in which he appeared to have a chance of a job. This
employment he kept up for some time after the match was made. King,
too, for a few weeks was tempted to “do the mountebank” with a travelling
company; but Tom did not take kindly to the business of “busking,”
and threw it up, returning to his London patrons.</p>

<p>As the time drew on, each man found it expedient to mingle more
decidedly in sporting circles, and thus create a greater interest than had
heretofore been exhibited, and this wise discrimination gradually had the
desired effect. The match began to be talked about in all quarters, flocks
of admirers followed the rival champions on every race course, or at any
place of public resort, and soon the discussion of their respective merits led
to a comparison of their deeds and their appearances with those of the
heroes of the old ring.</p>

<p>The nearer the time approached the mystery observed as to the actual
“where” tended not a little to foster anxiety, many of the intending
spectators being kept in a ferment of funk lest they should be thrown over
at the last. It was known it must be either at the end of November or
the beginning of December, and as the fights between Hicks and Gollagher
and Dillon and Reardon, both for high stakes, were fixed for about the
same time, the chance of being put on a wrong scent, and arriving at the
wrong ring side, redoubled the fears of the fidgety. The men themselves
even were not made acquainted with the actual day until within a week of
the time, and so well was the secret kept, that, until the previous Monday,
we believe the number of persons “fly” to the arrangements might be
numbered upon the fingers of the two hands.</p>

<p>Both Mace and King being sober, steady fellows in their habits, and both
being pretty well in their prime, and accustomed to hard work, there was
no inconvenience felt by either in their training in consequence of the
uncertainty as to the day of milling&mdash;&#8203;both being well up to the mark,
and, indeed, almost fit to fight before they went into training, which they
did some seven weeks before the eventful Wednesday; Mace at Newmarket,
at the old training quarters of Tom Sayers, under the care of
Howard, the Bradford jumper; and King at the “Baldfaced Stag,” near
Woodford, Essex, under Harry Harris. It is creditable to the respective
mentors of the men, that nothing was left undone which could ensure the
respective champions being in a meet state for the arduous task they had
set themselves.
</p>
<a name="Page_503" id="Page_503"></a><span class="pageno">503</span>

<p>Although there was so much excitement, and so much pleasurable anticipation
of the mill, it cannot be concealed that mixed up with it was a
taint of suspicion that all was not quite serene and square, arising from
the fact that the respective backers of the men had changed sides since
January, and that King, formerly an Eastern sage, and then an enlightened
West Ender, had relapsed into his original form; while Mace had, after a
fall from West to East, once more started Westward, and was backed from
the Haymarket, with at any rate a side wind help from his former patrons.
Some people imagined that nothing could be square under such circumstances
as these. They shut their eyes to ascertained facts, and then, by
a series of winks and knowing grins, strove to create a prejudice which
spread, no one knows how, and finally gained for the Ring and its <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégés</span>
that pleasing character they labour under among those who at all seasons,
and on all possible occasions, do all they can to decry the old manly sports
of their country.</p>

<p>The acting representatives of the men on this occasion were Mr.
Richardson, of the “Blue Anchor,” Church Street, for King, and Mr.
Coney, of Panton Street, for Jem Mace, who was partly backed by some
old fanciers. To these diplomatic managers the stakeholder in due course
communicated the actual day he had determined for the fray, but he declined
to fix a scene for the performance, as he considered an arena could
be better settled by the agents themselves, who could consult other parties
likely to have a finger in the pie, and without whose aid there would
certainly be no getting to the rendezvous, and without whose judgment that
rendezvous could not be determined on without great risk. The plan
turned out a wise one, and thanks to the energy and discrimination of those
concerned, all was satisfactorily arranged without let or hindrance.</p>

<p>We have alluded already to the difficulties which beset the managers of
Ring affairs at this period, and on the Monday morning Messrs. Richardson
and Coney received the unwelcome information, that the officials of a
certain railway company, with which they had made all pleasant for the
“excursion,” had decided to cancel the arrangements, and that no special
train would be provided. Here was a pretty fix for the executive. An
alternative line was immediately decided on. All ticketholders would be
conveyed by ordinary train to Thames Haven, where two commodious
steamboats would be ready for the conveyance of the voyagers to a <span class="lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra
incognita</span>. While these arrangements were perfecting on the Monday and
Tuesday, the uncertainty added to the excitement, and telegrams flew over
<a name="Page_504" id="Page_504"></a><span class="pageno">504</span>
the wires from every point of the compass from “country cousins” seeking
the “straight tip,” and town friends anxious to communicate the same.
The sporting houses, East and West, were thronged, reminding some of
the olden days when “Le Boxe,” as Alphonse calls it, was an “institution.”</p>

<p>As we have given an instance of “clerical” interest in Ring sports, on
another occasion, in the sister island, we may here note that a high
Anglican Church authority entered itself among the “tipsters” on this;
the <cite>Record</cite> giving a prominent place to the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fight">
<p>“The fight between James Mace and Thomas King is to take place on Tuesday next in
the neighbourhood of Aldershot.”</p>
</div><!--end editorial-->

<p>We hope the “tipster” who so egregiously sold the reverend editor, as
to day and place, did not add dishonesty to his pious fraud. At any rate
we fear, as we did not see him in his accustomed position, that our right
reverend friend, “the Bishop of Bond Street,” may have been misled by
ecclesiastical authority; we believe the police were&mdash;&#8203;of course we were not.</p>

<p>By four o’clock on Wednesday morning the approaches to Fenchurch
Street were alive with intending excursionists, who on arriving at the station
found the entrance crowded by a strong posse of roughs and thieves, always
to be found at their posts on such occasions. These gentry had a good
time of it, and so strong and daring were their forces, that the few ring
keepers engaged to protect the public were completely overpowered, and, in
many instances, eased of their own property. Bob Travers, among others,
was attacked and forcibly deprived of all he had about him. Many lost
their tickets, and many gentlemen were so intimidated that they declined
facing the ordeal, and returned home. The scene was, on the whole, disgraceful.
The managers of the undertaking were great sufferers, and were
loud in their complaints that the conduct of these roughs prevented their
reaping the harvest they had anticipated. Although the company commenced
assembling at four o’clock, it was fully seven before there were any
signs of a start, and the impatience of the early birds, although extreme,
was fully justifiable. There was no help for it, however, as all was in the
hands of the railway officials.</p>

<p>Fortunately the ring forces when concentrated were strong enough to
exclude most of the undesirables from the platform; still some few managed
to penetrate the ranks of the officials, and by their presence caused considerable
annoyance, although the force of ring keepers was sufficiently
strong to prevent their attempting any combined mischief. At length at
seven o’clock the whistle sounded, and we were off for the appointed spot,
<a name="Page_505" id="Page_505"></a><span class="pageno">505</span>
where two vessels were found in waiting, and on board these the travellers,
nearly 300 in number, at once repaired. It was now suggested that it
would be well to try and get the fight off on the spot, instead of going
further afield, where the Bobbies might be in force. This recommendation
was accepted with promptitude, and while the Corinthians were
luxuriating in a hot and comfortable breakfast on board, provided in
admirable style by their old caterer, Dan Pinxton, the ring was pitched,
and soon after eight all was in readiness. Through the exertions of Billy
Duncan and his pals such admirable arrangements were made for the comfort
of the inner ring ticket-holders that all were seated without difficulty,
and, so far as we could perceive, the whole thing was carried out in a
manner to reflect the highest credit on all concerned. As soon as the
office was given by Fred Oliver the men approached the magic circle;
Mace being the first to drop his castor within the ropes. He was attended
by his old opponents Bob Brettle and Bob Travers, while King, who was
somewhat behindhand, was waited on by Bos Tyler and Macdonald. Both
men were welcomed with loud cheers from their partisans, which each
acknowledged in a suitable manner. There was a good deal of lively
betting at 6 and 7 to 4 on Mace, and his backers, we believe, would have
gone on to any extent at that figure. A brisk business was done by the
sale of inner ring tickets, but by no means to the extent we have known
on former occasions. The sum received was nearly £37. Among the
spectators were Tom Sayers, Heenan, and many other fistic celebrities, who
eyed the tourney throughout with curiosity. And now the men stand up,
approach each other and grasp hands, then separate; the seconds retire to
their corners, and all eyes are fixed upon them as they upraise their
daddles, and square their elbows for</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Round 1.</span>&mdash;&#8203;The moment so fraught with
interest and excitement to the partisans of
the belligerents had now arrived; the busy
and careful work of the seconds was at last
completed to their entire satisfaction, and
the men were delivered at the scratch.
While their toilettes were being arranged,
the “making ready” had been eagerly
watched by all with almost breathless
silence. As Jem turned to face his opponent,
he gave a momentary glance at the sky,
whose dull, cheerless aspect was anything
but calculated to enliven the combatants.
Both advanced to the scratch with that
firm, confident step which denotes the action
of well-drilled practitioners. Perhaps the
first thing that riveted the attention of the
spectators, as the men stood front to front,
was the striking difference in height that
existed between them. It had been confidently
stated Mace had never been in
better condition; certainly as he stood thus
confronting his antagonist there was nothing
in his appearance that even the most fastidious
could for a moment find fault with,
and in all things he looked a far superior
man to what he did at their former meeting.
In weight Jem, when he last poised the
beam, pulled down 11<abbr title="stone">st.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>, and with inward
confidence beaming in his every look,
he stated it was impossible for a man to feel
better, and this assurance there can be no
<a name="Page_506" id="Page_506"></a><span class="pageno">506</span>
doubt had great weight with his admirers,
many of whom from over-caution had waited
for this “opinion” from Mace himself before
they had ventured to “put it on.” If condition
of itself could alone endow a man with
the requisite “resin” to tune the first fiddle
in such a grand pugilistic overture, Tom
might well put the thing down as a “certainty,”
for it must be admitted he was all
the most critical could desire, and spoke of the
result with a confidence devoid of anything
in the shape of braggadocia. The moment
the men had been “set” by their seconds,
there was perceptible that twitch and shrug of
the shoulders which denote a disapproval of
the morning air. Jem having put up the
prop in proper order drew from range, and
of his position it may be said the skill of the
master was at a glance displayed, for he
was well covered at all points. Tom also
stood remarkably well, and although by some
good judges he is stated to be a little too
fine about the loins, and by no means deep set
enough in the jaw and neck, yet we think it
was conceded by all impartial persons that
he looked a most formidable opponent.
Mace, as he manœuvred, looked at his man
with a sharp, penetrating glance, as though
he was mentally summing up “the King’s
affairs.” The result seemed satisfactory,
for Jem gave one of his well-known jerks of
his nob, as much as to say, “Tom, I intend
to give you another dressing.” King smiled
at his man, as to intimate, if he really imagined
he was capable of dressing him
again he would oblige by being quick
about it, as there needed something in the
shape of excitement to warm up the system.
After a little sparring, Mace drew from
range and dropped his mauleys, and then
with his right rubbed his breast and arms.
King imitated his action, as he felt numbed
about the arms, and thought it necessary to
do the burnishing to promote the circulation.
Jem, with a cautions step, drew into range,
and then by way of a feeler slightly let go
the left, but Tom, who was decidedly quicker
on his pins than we had found him in any of
his preceding battles, got well away with
the back step, thus showing that these
efforts on the part of his opponent to draw
out his guard were not likely to be successful.
As Mace broke for the purpose of
getting from distance, King dashed at him
in a most impetuous manner, and missed administering
a fine right-handed shot from the
fore-arm. Mace, as Tom came on for the
purpose of forcing the fighting, retreated,
but just opposite the referee and umpire
the men closed, when Jem, finding he
was likely to get in an awkward position,
ducked his head and went down, King looking
at him. Both men were loudly cheered,
and as there was just a shade of commotion
among those who formed the uprights of the
outer circle, Professor Duncan, attended
by the “faculty,” promptly administered
a mild dose of his efficacious remedy for
disorder&mdash;&#8203;the “syrup of whips”&mdash;&#8203;and the
cure was instantaneous.</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;At the call of “Time,” both men,
with the eagerness of swimmers for the first
plunge, rushed simultaneously from the
knees of their seconds, and threw up their
hands at the scratch. After toeing the mark
each again drew back from range, and
began rubbing himself, looking meanwhile
at each other like two game-cocks. Mace
then led with the left, but did not get it
home, as King got well from range. Tom
now dashed at his man, and delivered
the left on the top of the head, and put
in another from the fore-arm on the mouth,
which had the effect of producing a slight
show of the crimson. (“First blood,” as
on the former occasion, for Tom.) Jem,
after getting home slightly with the left and
right on the face, closed with his man,
when, finding he was likely to get into an
awkward position, he slipped from him and
got down, there being so far not much harm
done on either side, King fighting with
remarkable fairness; his opponent decidedly
more crafty and shifty, though, as Jack
Macdonald said, “We’ll give him all that
in.”</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;Jem was the first from his corner, but
no sooner did the busy seconds of King see
that his antagonist was on the move than
they gave the office, and with that impetuosity
of action so characteristic of him, he
at once advanced to the scratch. After
shifting, changing position, and taking fresh
ground, King went dashing at his man for
the purpose of forcing the fighting, and,
getting partly over Jem’s right cross-guard,
planted the left on the right cheek, and with
a wild, slinging round hit from the right
also got home on the side of the knowledge
box. Mace, in the counter-hitting, administered
one with his stinging left on the jaw,
when, as Tom was not to be kept out, they
closed. In the struggle for the fall King
got his right arm round his man, and they
went down near the referee in a curious,
awkward fall, Mace, who had his head bent
down, hitting the top part of it against the
ground. It was imagined by many at the
moment that Jem might have received some
severe harm, but they were soon convinced to
the contrary, for when the men had become
disentangled and Jem with his usual agility
had righted, he looked up with a broad grin,
as much as to say, “Don’t be uneasy, I’m
all right.” There was in the excitement
again a slight manifestation of pressure in
“Court,” the “special jury” being the
least bit inconvenienced, but Duncan, as
head usher, brought up his efficient corps to
point, and the weight of this legal element
was on the instant sufficient to restore
matters to their proper balance, and the
business of this admirably kept ring went
on as smoothly as ever.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;While the combatants were in their
corners every movement of their seconds
<a name="Page_507" id="Page_507"></a><span class="pageno">507</span>
was watched with the utmost minuteness,
and it was a treat to observe in what fine
order they sent them up to the mark. Tom
was the first to present his towering height
at the scratch, but was almost on the instant
met by his opponent. Bos Tyler pointed
at Mace, in a good-humoured manner, as
much as to intimate Jem had had some of
the burnishing powder. Mace feinted with
the left, but, finding he could not get in with
artistic effect, he did not let it go freely
from the shoulder. Tom, for the purpose of
taking better range, followed up and with
the left got home on the right cheek, and
also put in one from the right. As Mace
broke to get away, Tom hit out with both
mauleys, but did no execution, as Mace
threw the left off well with the right guard.
After slight sparring and manœuvring Tom
led the left, but it was not sent sufficiently
well in to be effective, nor did he meet with
any better success in following up with a
wild hit from the right, for Jem drew well
out of range. On again coming to distance,
King worked with his right arm backwards
and forwards, as though he intended to let
it go, but did not. As Jem shifted Tom
followed, when Mace got home a fine left-handed
hit on the jaw. The combatants in
the most spirited manner fought across the
ring, Mace administering some of the cayenne
with both mauleys. In the close both
struggled for the fall, when Tom got from
his man and went to grass in his own
corner.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;Mace was the first to come from his
corner, but he had not long to wait before
Tom faced him. Both men were considerably
pinked, and their physiognomies now
possessed more touches of beauty than are
to be found in their photographs in George
Newbold’s collection of celebrities. Jem,
as he came from his corner, bent his head
forward, as though he was mentally debating
in what new manner he should try
to get well at his man, who by the rapid
style in which he had been fighting, had
given proof that he was a dangerous antagonist.
King, the instant he had put
up his hands, went dashing to force the
fighting. With the left he administered
a stinger on the right cheek, and
followed up with a half round hit from the
right. Mace, as his opponent rushed at him
to close, drew out, but Tom, not to be
denied, followed up, when, in a rally, Jem
pegged away with both mauleys, left and
right, with astonishing rapidity, doing a
great deal of heavy execution. In the close
they struggled for the fall, when Mace threw
his man in clever style, near the ropes.
(The friends of Mace were in ecstasies, and
long odds were offered on their pet.)</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;Tom in the first two or three rounds
had unquestionably had a shade the best of it,
from the style in which he had gone dashing
at his man, and the quickness he had displayed.
Mace did not exhibit that steadiness
in his practice he afterwards did. Now,
however, that Jem had got the true measure
of his man there was a total change in his
tactics, and the manner in which he now
fought proved that he was in all respects
superior to the “big-’un” in science. Both,
on presenting themselves at the mark, bore
evidence of having been by no means idle, for
Jem was swelled about the ivories in a very
conspicuous manner, while King, from the
appearance of his left peeper, gave unmistakable
proof of having been warmed up;
he was likewise slightly bleeding from the
nose. Still there had been no serious damage
done on the part of either. After some little
manœuvring, the combatants changing and
shifting position, King dashed at his antagonist
in his usual style, getting home left
and right on the head. Mace met his man
as he came with the rush on the milling
suit, and, in one of the finest rallies that
could be witnessed, the combatants fought
right across the ring; there was something
delightful to the admirers of boxing in
Jem’s style of fighting his man with both
hands, left and right, at the nob. These
blows were delivered with a rapidity that
was quite electrifying, being sent ding dong,
straight home, so that Jem was all over his
man in an instant, the blows making an impression
as though Tom had been stamped
with a couple of dies. Tom was by no means
idle, but also pegged away at his man with
the left on the head and the right on the
body in merry fashion. In the close they
got on the ropes, when Jem for the moment
touched the top cord with his right hand, but
Tom having shifted his position, the men
struggled for the fall, when Tom, as a termination
to this well-fought round, was
under.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;As the battle progressed, so did it increase
in interest, for there was a marked
speciality about the manner in which it was
being fought that could not possibly fail to
enhance its importance among the admirers
of bold and genuine boxing. There can be
no disputing, both men had been from the
commencement fighting remarkably well,
and the battle, as will be seen, had already
presented two striking and prominent features;
for though, until Jem had thoroughly
got the measure of his man, King had in
the opening bout been considered to have a
slight lead, yet the style in which Mace was
now performing was sufficient to convince
all that there had not been the slightest
mistake made in his merits as regards milling
excellence. The combatants came
simultaneously from their corners. Tom,
as he stood at the scratch, opened his mouth
and rubbed his hands, and then, on again
putting himself into position, drew out and
retreated to his own corner, Mace following.
Both, as they again drew to range, steadied
themselves, and in a fine counter with the
left got well home, Jem doing execution on
the snout, Tom on the top part of the
<a name="Page_508" id="Page_508"></a><span class="pageno">508</span>
cranium. Mace, on breaking, got to the
ropes, when, as Tom came boring in to close,
he slipped from the embrace of the young
giant and got down.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;From the manner in which the tints
had been rubbed in it was apparent the
colours had been well worked up, though this
was much more conspicuous on Tom’s dial
than his opponent’s, for King’s left peeper
had a small lump on the side of it, while the
nose and mouth looked a good deal puffed.
Tom, as usual, taking the initiative, lunged
out the left, but did no execution, as he was
not well to distance. Mace, after King had
opened with this wild hit, took up fresh position,
and in doing so, as he was followed by
his antagonist, he hit the back part of his
head against the stake. As Tom pressed in,
Jem pulled himself together, and after some
fine left-handed counter-hitting, in which
Mace delivered very heavily on the middle
of the head, they closed and went down,
Mace through the ropes. The battle had now
lasted 22 minutes, and it had been nothing
but downright hard fighting and no mistake.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;King made another dash at Jem, “on
hostile thoughts intent,” and got home apparently
a hot-’un on the right eye, but
there was no sign of injury, evidently owing
to Jem’s excellent condition. Jem instantly
returned a severe prop on the dial with the
left, and then countered a second effort on
the part of King, who essayed his right.
Tom, desperate, now dashed in with headstrong
determination, and bored his man
through the ropes, to the delight of the
Kingites, who, however, declined to take 6
to 4, freely offered by the backers of Mace.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;Mace, the instant the signal was
given, came forth with the utmost alacrity
to renew the struggle. King, as an opening
to the attack, lunged out the left, and administered
a telling spank on Jem’s right
jaw; and then, as Tom came dashing on,
the men fought in a fine two-handed rally
right across the ring, when King got his
man’s nob for an instant in the right arm
lock, and pegged away in the fibbing beautifully.
Jem, like a good tactician, extricated
himself; and after some severe milling, in
which Mace got in the most telling manner
on his man’s mouth, cheek, and nose&mdash;&#8203;going,
in fact, all over the dial with his clenched
digits in a rapid and surprising manner&mdash;&#8203;the
men closed at the ropes right opposite to the
umpire and referee, when Jem got his man
in position, and gave him a fair back-heel
fall. Immense cheering for Mace.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;King’s left eye looked worse than
ever, while his good-looking mug was knocked
out of all symmetry. Nevertheless he was
again first to begin the attack, and in leading
got home the left on the right cheek,
following it in with one from the right on
the side of the pimple. Jem, who timed his
man beautifully, administered another tremendous
left-hander on the mazzard, when
Tom’s nob, from its effect, went waving
back. On the instant, however, he pulled
himself together and dashed in to renew the
struggle, when Jem met him, and delivered
a tremendous left-hander on the nose, which
produced a copious flow of blood. As Mace
took fresh ground Tom again dashed in, and
they fought a regular ding-dong, slogging
give-and-take to a close. Tom, with his
usual style of bending his head slightly forward,
went dashing at Jem, and got more
than one straightening prop. They again
fought in regular ding-dong to a close, when
Tom, while receiving Jem’s props on the
dial, made use of the right once or twice in
a very efficient manner on the body, upon
which Mace got from his man and went
down. The referee here called the attention
of Tom’s seconds to the fact that their man
had struck Jem while he was down, which
was true; but Mace was just on the go, and
King could not help the hit, which was evidently
unintentional, and no harm was done.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Another splendid rally in this round,
Mace again in a telling manner doing execution
with both mauleys, but evidently forced
back by King’s irresistible advance. The
men, who had fought right across the ring,
closed in Mace’s corner, when Jem got down,
Tom falling on him. During this round the
referee had several times to caution the
seconds, who, in a most reprehensible manner,
followed their principals as closely as
frequently to be in the way of the combatants.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;The men again went to work in a
spirited and determined manner. Jem, with
his left, got well home on the front of his
man’s dial, and jumped back; when Tom,
with his right, administered some sounding
spanks on the ribs. As Jem broke to get
away, King followed him up, and Mace went
down to end the round.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Mace commenced operations by getting
well in range and delivering a pretty
left-hander full on the nose, knocking Tom’s
head round as though it had been shaken off
its connections; nevertheless Tom again
tried to force the fighting, when, after
some merry exchanges, they closed, and in
the fall went down together in the centre of
the ring. King’s friends cheered him heartily,
as he fully deserved.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;Some sharp fighting, rather in favour
of Mace, who, in the end, went down in the
hitting, and King fell over him.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Tom dashed in viciously, and after a
fine exchange of compliments, in which each
did execution, they closed, and Jem, who
had had the best of the exchanges, fell
under.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;Tom again forced the fighting, but
though he delivered with his left, he was a
little too round with his right to be effective.
Mace, after countering with his antagonist,
and getting well home with the
left in the middle of the head, and following
<a name="Page_509" id="Page_509"></a><span class="pageno">509</span>
up at half measure with the right, got cleverly
away from his man. As Jem took fresh
position, Tom followed him up, and the men
in a rally fought to the ropes. In the close
both got under the top rope, and fell nearly
out of the ring.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;Such a certainty was the battle looked
upon by some of Jem’s admirers that Johnny
Gideon here offered £30 to £5 on him, but
there were no takers. Indeed, Tom’s umpire,
a good judge, said that, bar accident, Mace
could not lose. After some more severe
fighting, in which Mace again delivered in a
telling manner on Tom’s dial with both
mauleys, Tom made a slip in getting from
his man, and fell on his knees. On the instant
the game fellow recovered his perpendicular,
and as Jem noticed this he beckoned
him to renew the round. King was willing,
but his well-skilled seconds, seeing the fast
work he was doing, refused to allow him.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;It now seemed “all over, but shouting,”
to the partisans of Mace, who called
out any odds, without response. As the men
came up it was easy to see that Jem, thinking
himself already victorious, was anxious
to finish off the business, lest the appearance
of the police, which had been rumoured,
should rob him of his conquest at the last
moment. He worked in with both hands in
weaving style to get well to distance, and as
he took up his position he got into a slight
hollow of the ring. Jem, who had repeatedly
tried to land a clipping cross-counter with
his right, had just opened himself for the
purpose of trying it on, when Tom, who
stood firmly to his guns, met him with one of
the most tremendous hits we ever saw. It
was a cross-counter on the left cheek with
his right hand&mdash;&#8203;a blow that seemed to go
all over Jem’s face with crushing effect.
Jem, bleeding from the mouth and nose,
reeled and staggered from the effect of this
visitation, and then, to the consternation of
friends, fell in the middle of the ring all of
a heap. So sudden a change in the aspect
of affairs had hardly ever been witnessed in
the memory of the oldest ring-goer, and
Jem’s seconds were working with a zeal
which told how serious was the position.
Down came the odds. “The Champion’s
licked,” said twenty voices in a sort of stage
whisper, and all eyes were strained in the
direction of the busy group in Mace’s corner.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;King walked up to the scratch,
watching the referee with ill-concealed
anxiety to hear the call of “Time.” When,
however, that functionary had twice repeated
his summons, Mace, who had by no
means recovered from the settler he had received,
came unsteadily from his corner.
Tom walked up to him, and Mace tried a
wild delivery with his left, Tom retorted
with a hot blow on the nose, and Mace, in
getting away, went down close to the referee’s
seat like a lump of lead. There was
now the greatest commotion and excitement
all round the ring. It was now as clearly
King’s victory as it had previously been
Mace’s. Brettle and Travers worked with a
will, doing for their man everything possible,
and he gallantly seconded their efforts, resolutely
refusing to allow them to throw up
the sponge.</p>

<p>21 and last.&mdash;&#8203;Before Mace left his corner
Tom was waiting for his man, and no sooner
did Mace come up than King went to him,
and, with a slight push on the head, sent
him down. Jem, who was weak and exhausted,
and who had the right side of his
phiz swelled in an extraordinary manner
from the effects of King’s right-hander, was
now clearly <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</span>, and his friends,
seeing he had not the remotest chance of
winning, threw up the sponge in spite of his
protests. This token of defeat was hailed
with loud shouts by Tom’s friends, who were,
of course, doubly delighted at the bravery
and good fortune of their man, and they
crowded enthusiastically round King to hail
him as the last addition to the roll of brave
men who have borne the proud title of
Champion of England. The battle lasted
exactly thirty-eight minutes.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;There can be little question
as to the fact that King’s decisive victory
was more immediately due to the tremendous
hit to which Mace laid himself open by his
over-eagerness to plant what he considered
a sort of <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span> on his gallant adversary.
His skill in administering, as well as
avoiding punishment, had given him an apparent
best, but he had not reduced the
courage and confidence, nor exhausted the
strength of his dangerous antagonist. The
“hit” that King “had left in him,” was, as
Jem found to his cost that day, worth the
Championship of England. That this is no
disparagement of King’s victory all must
admit, and a more gallant display of skill
and bravery could not have been witnessed
in any day present or past. King’s fairness
of style in the finish of several rounds, when
the lead trembled in the balance, shone conspicuously,
and was warmly acknowledged
by the spectators.</p>
</div><!--end fight div-->

<p>At the giving up of the stakes, on the Thursday night week, King once
again announced his intention of not contesting the Championship. This
was generally understood as owing to obligations of another description
in which a “ring” also had a part, and not a few of Young Tom’s intimates
<a name="Page_510" id="Page_510"></a><span class="pageno">510</span>
drank a toast to his matrimonial felicity, in the old formula of “The
single married, and the married happy.”</p>

<p>A curious telegraphic contretemps, which may serve as a caution to the
over-clever, occurred on this occasion. Mr. William Wright, of Fulwood’s
Rents, who was at this period an immense authority, had arranged with
his London clerks that, to prevent surreptitious use of the earliest intelligence,
for which he had incurred a large outlay, his telegram would give the
losing man as winner, and they were to read it and manifold it accordingly.
Having therefore sent off, at the earliest possible moment, “Mace beat King,”
with the number of rounds, <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> the telegraph clerk on the spot, thinking
he knew to the contrary, innocently set the message <em>right</em>, and, out of kindness,
sent over the wire, “King beat Mace;” whereon the clerks dutifully
followed their instructions, and the wrong result was extensively circulated
to clubs, subscribers, <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and for some hours a bewildering uncertainty
prevailed.</p>

<p>The Young Sailor, however, had excited too great an interest in the
public mind to be allowed to sink quietly into oblivion. He had distinctly
stated that he did not seek the distinction, if distinction it was, of the
Championship, and he resigned the belt into the hands of the Editor of
<cite>Bell’s Life</cite>. Heenan, however, having made some good friends among
gentlemen of the turf by his civility, intelligence, and good conduct,
intimated to several of these, that if there was any “big one” desirous to
try conclusions with him, he was ready to make a “quiet match” for not
less than £500, and he had friends who would make it £1000 if required.
This was formally communicated to the Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, with a wish
that no bouncing or offensive challenge should be inserted. The Editor
at once put these facts in circulation in proper quarters, and the proposition,
like most American notions, “a big thing,” made some of Tom King’s
friends prick up their ears. Mace was engaged “two deep,” and moreover
was not “their man.” A conference was held at Owen Swift’s, to which
Tom King was invited, and he, with ready gallantry, declared the opportunity
was most inviting and welcome. Money was forthcoming on both
sides, and as both sides meant business, the paper subjoined was soon
formulated&mdash;</p>

<p>The match made, each man at once proceeded to make trading capital
out of it by travelling the provinces, and this at first led to a belief
that the match would never come to anything, but was merely got up for
this purpose. On the other hand it was asserted, that the match was sure
to come off, but the result had been cut and dried; that the backers of the
men intended to make a trading speculation out of the “Special” which
was to convey the belligerents to the scene of action. It was known that
a sum of more than £1000 had been divided between Sayers and Heenan
out of the profits of the train for their match, and the supposition was,
perhaps, not unnatural that £500 would be very good interest upon £100
for a few months, setting aside the off chance of something else turning up
into the bargain. As the day approached for the men to go into training
fears as to the affair not being genuine quickly subsided, and in racing
circles the match created much interest, numerous bets of 6 to 4 being laid
on the Benicia Boy, whose appearance at Newmarket during the October
Meetings fully justified the confidence reposed in him. Heenan took his
breathings almost entirely at Newmarket in company with his own brother
Jem, and Macdonald, but required very little, if any, looking after. His
feats as a pedestrian during his work were something extraordinary, six
miles and a “bittock” did he generally turn in ordinary walking, and many
a spin and a tie up did he give to some of our crack jocks, among whom
are to be found no mean specimens of fair toe-and-heel walkers. Jack’s
spins at the top of his speed, too, not a little astonished the Browns, and
<a name="Page_512" id="Page_512"></a><span class="pageno">512</span>
we have been credibly informed he could on a pinch do his quarter in 56
seconds&mdash;&#8203;not bad for a 14 stone man, standing nearly 6 feet 2 inches.
When stripped his frame was a model for a sculptor. Every muscle was
developed to a gigantic size, every tendon and sinew was distinctly visible;
and, taken altogether, we doubt whether such a specimen of a Hurculean
frame has been witnessed in the British <abbr title="Prize Ring">P. R.</abbr> for very many years. That
Heenan possessed every confidence in himself may be gathered from the
fact that some three weeks previously he sent a message to the stakeholder,
requesting him to state that if he did not lick King the public ought
to stigmatise him as the greatest impostor who ever entered the Ring.
The Editor tells us that he declined to insert this statement at the time,
as not being fair to either party, and considering that should the result
justify the observation it would be time enough to make it when the battle
was over. Heenan, as may be recollected, was born in 1834, at Troy,
United States, of Irish parents. His fighting weight on stripping on the
present occasion was, as near as possible, 14 stone 2<abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr></p>

<p>As the time of battle drew near the difficulties of a mode of transit to
the ground increased. One after another refusals of accommodation were
returned, the powers and authorities having experienced the disorders which
seemed inseparable from the gathering of such a crowd as had now made
it a custom to gather on such an occasion. During Saturday, Monday,
and Tuesday, the offices of the sporting newspapers, to say nothing of
the “houses of call” for sporting men, were besieged by questioners;
but beyond the fact that tickets at three sovereigns a head were procurable,
no definite tip was to be had.</p>

<p>Tuesday evening was a night of festivity at all sporting pubs. The
public fully believing that on the following morning the mill would come
off, and all being agog to get the necessary tip. It was not until well into
the small hours that many would believe that Wednesday was not the day.
The same scene was repeated on Wednesday, with the exception that delay
had doubled the excitement, and the houses, which on Tuesday were
crammed, were on the following night well nigh overwhelmed, and the
ordinary business could scarcely be transacted. At Owen Swift’s much
anxiety was expressed as to whether a bet of £600 to £400 appointed to be
put down the night before the fight would really be forthcoming, certain
half-sceptics pinning their faith on this ceremony as calculated to prove
the genuine nature of the match. It was also expected it would materially
affect the betting, many considering that the staking would show such
<a name="Page_513" id="Page_513"></a><span class="pageno">513</span>
confidence on the part of King’s backers as would justify his being backed
for money.</p>

<p>On our arrival at London Bridge Station a few minutes before five in the
morning, we found that the “rasping” division had dwindled away to an insignificant
few. The fact is, the busy tongue of rumour had sent them so often
to the various stations on a Will o’ the Wisp errand, that the detrimentals
were completely tired out, and, after the lesson of Tuesday and Wednesday
nights, without anything turning up, they denounced the whole affair as
“a sell,” and stayed at home. Never was a secret of such a kind better
kept, and the wide-awakes who “knew the exact spot to a yard,” found
themselves neck deep in the mire, after a fashion they little calculated on;
the cut-purse family wiping the frosty icicles from their noses in the west,
when they should have been looking out for squalls in the South Eastern
horizon. The delightful result was that the congregation of the fistic art
passed through the thin dark line of worn and weary snapper-badgers. The
arrangements of the legitimate “conveyancers” were most excellent; everybody
was comfortably “taken in and done for,” whilst the presence of the
ring-constable volunteers set the foot of authority down with a crash upon
all attemps at “rigging the market.” In fact, one might have thought that
he was going to see an early ploughing match, whilst the “Yahoo” business
didn’t rise as high as the song of an old tea-kettle. Indeed, that ugly
element was wise in the course it was constrained to adopt; had it done
otherwise there was force enough present to have brought every atom of it
to grief. Both the men reached the ground in good time, and both had
their fair quantity of supporters, who would persist in blocking up each
carriage door, so that the entrance of a breath of air was almost next to an
impossibility.</p>

<p>The train consisted of thirty carriages, in each of which, to use a theatrical
phrase, there was not standing room. We were “horsed” by two powerful
engines, and, at about a quarter past six glided out of the station without
the least confusion, and with the greatest regularity. The morning stars
were just beginning to show signs of that glimmering faintness which indicates
the approach of daybreak. Once the train got in motion, not a sound
was to be heard save the outburst of some occasional hearty laugh at
the jocularity going on inside. But even this was of the mildest possible
character, and there was an entire absence of that reprehensible boisterous
outpouring which has too often awoke the slumbering people along the
route, filling their half-dreamy imaginations with the horror that the
<a name="Page_514" id="Page_514"></a><span class="pageno">514</span>
Philistines were upon them. We were more than half afraid that the new
plan of paying at the doors would have been productive of the direst confusion,
but our apprehensions were agreeably dispelled.</p>

<p>On casting a quiet running glance through the interior of each carriage,
before we started, we found the genuine patrons of our national manly
“trial by battle” in very strong force indeed. We heard one and all join
in a universal chorus of satisfaction at the way in which we had been
“got off.” On and on we rolled through the fair county of Kent, and as
the grey dawn of morning rose eastward on our track the mild fresh breeze
played upon our half-sleepy faces, waking us up to a sense of life and
activity that was as agreeable as it was invigorating. The morning was
beautiful and mild, and away now to our left the bright blue-tinged light of
early day could be seen breaking gently and softly, widening and lengthening
as it imperceptibly spread over the landscape in a manner that
would have excited the admiration of a Gainsborough or a Creswick.
Still on and onward we go through deep cuttings and over high embankment;
anon the iron horses slacken their speed, and the next instant the
reverberating sounds of our whirling wheels tell us that we are passing
through the bowels of mother earth. On emerging from the tunnel into
open country our ears were saluted with voices that unmistakably marked
the owners as denizens of the aristocratic regions west of Regent
Street. Speculation made itself heard, and 6 and 7 to 4 on the Benicia Boy
seemed to be the chorus of the song. Just as we could distinguish houses
and buildings sufficiently, the train glided noiselessly into Reigate Junction,
where we were “regaled” by the sight of a strong covey of early “blue
birds” belonging to the Surrey County Constabulary. It is needless to
say that they were not there on our invitation. We considered them more
free than welcome, and following the prudent and time-honoured example
of those philosophic predecessors of theirs, Masters Dogberry and Verges
of blessed memory, we stole ourselves out of their company with all possible
alacrity and despatch. A thin white frosty veil of mist floated over the
landscape as we again got in full swing, whilst the leaden coloured clouds
as they lay heavy and motionless overhead gave us cause for grave anxiety,
but, as our fears were rising to an uncomfortable grade on our nervous
thermometer, in we rushed to another tunnel. When we issued forth we
made a series of weatherwise surveys all round us, and were joyed to find
the dark curtain lifting evenly and gradually up on our right, whilst on the
opposite side bright broken patches encouraged our most earnest hopes,
<a name="Page_515" id="Page_515"></a><span class="pageno">515</span>
Another turn of the steam valve, and away we sped at over forty miles
an hour; wood and dell, hamlet and village, cottage and mansion flew by
like the magic of the kaleidoscope, and the question of our journey’s end
took the place of other topics for the moment. A few miles further on
and we shot by Tunbridge Wells. By this time we could see that the
“bold peasantry” were discussing their breakfast, but as we rattled on at
the rate of a mile a minute and a half, we did not take particular notice of
what they ate. At length we drew up in a secluded and well-selected spot,
where we got out, yawned, stretched ourselves, and gulped in the sharp
morning air most voraciously. On account of the extreme softness of the
ground it was some time before a decent place could be found. At this
hour, about a quarter past nine o’clock, the sun was shining out as magnificently
as on a fine May morning, and as we toiled some mile and a half
up a steep clayey hill, the “stuff” was taken out of many. At length a
chosen spot was taken possession of, and the ring pitched in a field at
Wadhurst, near Frant, below Tunbridge Wells. King first dropped in his
castor, amid loud cheers, accompanied by Jerry Noon and Bos Tyler, and
was immediately followed by Heenan, who was similarly received, being
esquired by Jack Macdonald, and, for the sake of theatrical effect, Tom
Sayers. Colours were now unfolded on both sides, and the combatants
began to dress. The choice of ground was won by Heenan, and then came
the referee. Some wrangling here took place in respect to that functionary,
during which the betting went on with offers at 40 to 20, <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> on
Heenan, but there did not seem to be any takers. Confusion now became
the ruling element, wasting away precious time on the top of a hill that
could be seen for twenty miles around. There were the men and their
seconds ready, while the referee was expected to come from the clouds.
Three quarters of an hour was spent in this way before matters were finally
closed, and the referee originally proposed was ultimately agreed to. The
men then began the important duty of the toilet, and in the hands of their
respective valets that operation was soon completed. The ring was then
cleared, and the men showed themselves ready in battle array. Heenan
was the first to exhibit, mid the loud cheers of his admirers, and was instantly
followed by King, for whom another salvo rose up from the throats of his
party. Exactly at ten o’clock the men were delivered at the scratch, shook
hands, and prepared to commence
</p>
<a name="Page_516" id="Page_516"></a><span class="pageno">516</span>

<div class="fight">
<p class="center">THE FIGHT.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Round 1.</span>&mdash;&#8203;As the men advanced towards
the centre of the ring the first glance seemed
to show how great were the physical advantages
of Heenan, who looked quite the stone
heavier man he really was&mdash;&#8203;King being comparatively
a fair-skinned stripling; but a
closer inspection revealed a jaded appearance.
He looked clumsier altogether than when he
fought Sayers. King, on the contrary, was as
well as ever he could be, and there was a bloom
and healthfulness about him, which spoke
not only of steady training, but of an unvitiated
constitution. He had not altogether
the cut of a professional pugilist, but would
rather be described as a fine, fresh, good-looking
young countryman. The men threw
themselves into attitude, and opened the
round with a little sparring, but there was a
hurried, not to say nervous, manner about
each of them, which indicated that the scientific
display would not be very prolonged.
Heenan led off once or twice, but was not
close enough. King was equally out of distance
in trying to return. At last they got
nearer, and exchanged good counter-hits.
A couple more heavy hits were given, and
King was drawing back to take up fresh
ground, when Heenan plunged desperately
at him, and got his left arm round his neck;
the impetus of his rush carrying them both
to the ropes. Here Heenan sought to fix
his man in the dangerous manner he had
practised with Sayers, but King’s strength
enabled him to wrench himself up, and,
locked together, they wrestled back to the
centre of the ring. Here Heenan hung upon
his man, squeezing him tightly, and trying
to force him down. King, whose arms were
at liberty, hit him heavily about the body
left and right, until he fell, dragging
Heenan with him, but the Yankee was
uppermost. (The referee here entered the
ring and cautioned Heenan as to his “hugging”
system, which was certainly an unsightly
mode of attack.)</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;Both men were somewhat flushed
about the head from the previous round,
and King appeared a little distressed from
the severe struggle. He was urged to be
first with his man, and led off directly he
came to the scratch. He got well home on
Heenan’s head; the latter countered, but
without much precision, and some wild but
heavy exchanges took place with both hands,
King dealing the Yankee a severe blow on
the mouth. Tom was pressing his man,
when Heenan made a dash at him, and
showing great superiority in strength, after
a few seconds of squeezing, threw him
heavily, a very dangerous fall, coming with
all his weight upon him. (<em>First blood</em> was
here given to King; Heenan’s lips being cut
and bleeding.)</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;King seemed anxious to keep away
from his man spar; there was no doubt
that he was already considerably shaken by
the severe falls he had received. Heenan
appeared more anxious to seize a favourable
chance to grasp his man than to hit him.
After a moment’s pause they got together,
and lashed out heavily with the left, each
getting home. This led to some more
exchanges, desperately heavy, it is true, but
made in a wild style, and not like two
finished boxers. Heenan again plunged in,
King meeting him heavily as he came, but
he grappled Tom, and again brought him
down with shattering force across the lower
rope, which was pressed to the ground.
Luckily the ground was not hard. (Unpleasant
as was Heenan’s style of fighting, he
was considered to be getting the best of the
battle, as King evidently could not resist
his rush and clinching throw.)</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;King’s left eye was marked with a
mouse, but otherwise he did not show much
signs of punishment. The rounds were all
short ones, Heenan forcing his way in upon
King, a few slashing exchanges; then King
was once more caught in the hug, and
thrown a desperate fall. (Great disapprobation
of Heenan’s style of fighting&mdash;&#8203;if
fighting it could be called. His hugging
and squeezing was far worse than even in
Sayers’s fight.)</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;King was as ready at the call of “time”
as his antagonist, yet evidently felt the falls
he was receiving, and sparred a bit for wind.
Heenan was distressed also, and glad of a
pause. They worked round a bit until they
got near, when King, with the swiftness of
lightning, dealt the Yankee a terrific hit in
the middle of the head with his right,
almost knocking him off his legs, and drawing
streams of claret from a cut on his
mouth. It was nearly a floorer, and on
Heenan trying a return, King cross-countered
very heavily on the side of the
head. Heenan was for a moment at a
standstill, and King led off again, but was
out of distance, and the Yankee again
“clinching”&mdash;&#8203;we must borrow an Americanism
which expresses more than our word
“closing”&mdash;&#8203;succeeded in once more putting
on the “hug” and throwing King heavily;
though he pitched over him so far as to
strike the ground with his own head.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;The fighting had been wild enough
before, but in this round there was no
attempt at precision or steadiness. The men
punched&mdash;&#8203;or punched at&mdash;&#8203;one another
wildly, King getting the best of what hitting
did tell, till Heenan closed, and, getting
his regular grip, flung King a burster.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;The men went to work directly they
faced each other, and in a slogging rally
some really terrific hitting was given and
taken. They broke away, but only for a few
seconds, when they got together with more
tremendous exchanges, yet still to the advantage
<a name="Page_517" id="Page_517"></a><span class="pageno">517</span>
of King, who allowed what little
science was exhibited, and hit straightest.
By a desperate snorter with his right, during
this rally, he drew a fresh burst of crimson.
Heenan closed in the hitting, hugged his
man viciously, and then threw him one of
the heaviest cross-buttocks seen for many
a day. It was a crusher, and King lay for a
few seconds until his seconds picked him up
and bore him to his corner.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;King, to the delight of his friends,
came up promptly; although he was piping
a little, he seemed marvellously little hurt
by these continuous throws. Heenan was
ready to fight to improve his supposed advantage,
and the men exchanged stinging
counters directly they faced each other, and
heavy exchanges followed. Heenan dashed
in as usual to seize his man, but on this
occasion he was foiled, for King caught him
in his arms; and, after a moment’s struggle,
threw the Yankee heavily and fell on him.
(This was a fair, unmistakable back fall and
the cheering for King was tremendous.)</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;Heenan looked vexed as he came up;
he had plainly made up his mind to recover
his wrestling superiority, and tried for an
opening. King was with him, and met him
left and right; then, getting away again,
planted on him with tremendous effect as he
came in, catching his man well in the middle
of the head; and now and then, in each of
the rounds, giving a home hit on the body.
Heenan at last got in, squeezed his man
savagely, and again threw him a shattering
fall.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;The wildest and fastest of fighting
still continued, in fact, the rally more resembled
a “turn-up” of two angry navvies
than the tactics of skilled boxers. The exchanges
were of the severest description,
although most of the blows seemed given at
random. Heenan was wholly bent on throwing,
and once more hugged King and threw
him.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;Heenan showed that the pace was
telling on him, and it was doubtful whether
he was not taking almost as much out of
himself by his desperate struggles to throw
King, as he was out of King by the falls.
He persevered in his wrestling game, however,
for hardly an attempt was made at a
blow in this round before he grappled with
King, and brought him over.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;Tom was a little more on his guard
this time, and led off; Heenan returned,
and a few seconds of very hard fighting took
place, both men being hit severely about the
head till they closed, when King again succeeded
in turning the tables, and threw
Heenan heavily.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;Although this round began with some
countering which looked very heavy, yet
Heenan’s blows did not, as a rule, tell very
much; and when his seconds sent him
up King looked clean, and comparatively
free from punishment. Heenan again gave
his man the hug, and threw him. After this
round Heenan’s left hand became gradually
of less service to him.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;Heenan feinted with his left, and
threw in a smasher on the head with his
right. King stuck to him, but after some
stinging exchanges, in which he had the best,
he was thrown&mdash;&#8203;one of the most tremendous
cross-buttocks ever seen&mdash;&#8203;and so stunned
and shaken was King, that but for the tact
and presence of mind of Jerry Noon, it is
doubtful if he could have come to time.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;In spite of the very heavy falls being
nearly always in his favour, Heenan was now
almost as much distressed as King, and the
punishment given was certainly much against
him. After a little sparring, heavy counters
were exchanged, and then three or four
smashing hits left and right, without a semblance
of stopping or avoiding. Heenan drew
back a little, and then lunging tremendously
with his right, nailed King with such terrific
force that he staggered and went down.
(This was <em>first knock-down blow</em> in favour of
Heenan, and was one at the few clean hits
he delivered or even attempted to deliver
during the fight.)</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;Although slower than before in
answering the call of “time,” King came resolutely
up, and did not seem greatly shaken
by the knock-down blow. Indeed, Heenan
appeared worse from the effects of the last
round than did his opponent, as King had
planted so heavily on his left eye that it was
badly cut and nearly closed. In some more
heavy punching&mdash;&#8203;pure slogging give-and-take,
without any show of science&mdash;&#8203;Heenan’s
eye was quite shut up, and he showed some
decided signs of weakness. King dashed in,
and, after an exhausting struggle, forced
him down.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;In this round Heenan again got the
fall; but it was for the last time. He was
evidently falling off; and when once his
superiority in strength or wrestling power
was gone he seemed useless and almost helpless
as a boxer. King hit him tremendously
about the side of the head and on the eyes,
and it appeared as if Heenan would soon be
blind. However, as just said, he clutched
King desperately, and threw him one of the
hardest falls in the fight. But it was his
last effort, and while he became visibly
weaker every minute, King, strange to say,
seemed little the worse.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;There was at first some fear that the
ring would be broken in; for the intense excitement
among the outer crowd had induced
a rush, which broke through the lukewarm
resistance of the constables, and brought the
mass up to the ropes. Luckily, however,
nothing came of it. Heenan, thinking he
had shaken King more than was really the
case, and probably feeling that he was growing
exhausted himself, rushed furiously at
his man to improve his advantage. King,
however, who had quickly recovered himself,
met him with a couple of hits left
and right, stopping the Yankee’s rush, and
<a name="Page_518" id="Page_518"></a><span class="pageno">518</span>
while he was yet on the stagger King closed,
and, giving him the crook, pitched him over,
and tell on him with stunning force.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;Heenan came up rather hurriedly
when time was called, but it was at once
seen that he was almost beaten, and was
quite groggy. He tried his rush, but it was
no longer dangerous, and King stepped back
twice, measured his distance, planted on
him without a return, and, by a second
straight hit, sent him down. In the 20th
round King managed to back-heel Heenan.
The same description applies to the next
two rounds, excepting that in each of them
Heenan grew shakier and wilder, and King’s
superiority more marked. At the commencement
of the 23rd round it was proposed
to throw up the sponge, but Heenan
would not hear of it, and staggered at his
man with the semblance of his former rush.
He staggered after receiving a blow, and
was thrown by King without a chance of
resisting. His backers, seeing that it was
hopeless, and that it was only exposing the
sinking boxer to punishment, insisted on
his surrender, and the sponge was thrown
up in token of defeat, after a desperate, but
slashing, hugging, and unscientific battle of
<em>thirty-five minutes</em>, and twenty-four rounds.</p>

<p>     <span class="sc">Remarks.</span>&mdash;&#8203;We may well spare any
lengthened comment upon a contest the
leading characteristics of which were
“clinching,” rushing, squeezing, and attempts
at strangulating hugs on the one
side, and wild, desperate sledge-hammer
defensive hitting on the other. Heenan
proved beyond doubt or cavil that he did
not deserve to rank in the first or even
second rank of artistic boxers, and that
sheer brute strength, seconded by weight,
stature, and a certain amount of mere
animal courage were his only qualifications.
He seemed to have little idea of sparring
for an opening, or as a means of defence;
while the use of the skilful feints, well-timed
delivery, or accurate measurement
of distance, of getting close and then getting
away, as practised by professional boxers,
he ignored or despised. It was not the fault
of Tom King that the fight was so bad.
His form and style were far the better of
the two, for he did not trust to mere wrestling
and hauling his man about, and would
have made a better show of tactics with a
better man. Those flatterers who told
Heenan that he could stand a comparison
with King’s former opponent, Jem Mace,
must have been grossly ignorant or wilfully
deceived themselves. Few who saw
this contest but felt, that it was solely the
accident which so early in the battle disabled
the gallant Tom Sayers’s right arm, had prevented
the signal defeat of Heenan on the
memorable day at Farnborough. King
showed but few marks of severe hitting
after the fight, nor was he so seriously exhausted
by the falls as might have been
expected, considering the weight and
stature of both men. On the other hand,
Heenan was seriously disfigured, indeed,
utterly prostrate, and nearly blinded at the
close of the encounter. Altogether, while
an honest and game fight, it was an unsatisfactory
one; the sole point settled being the
entire absence, on the part of Heenan, of
those scientific attainments and steady
attributes indispensable to the successful
practitioner in the Prize Ring. The immense
stake, £2,000, so glaringly disproportionate
to the merits of the battle, was
duly paid over to King. For the circumstance
of the appearance of the once formidable
Tom Sayers at the ring-side, as second
to his former antagonist, John Heenan, the
reader is referred to pages 435 and 436 of
the present volume.</p>

<p>Again, and for the last time, Tom King announced his retirement from
professional pugilism; we shall not, therefore, follow him into private life
farther than to say, that he has carried with him the respect he earned by
his public career, and that the last we heard of him was that he had earned
the peaceful distinction of a prizeman, as a successful cultivator of flowers
at horticultural shows, held in the neighbourhood of his suburban dwelling.
And here we legitimately close the task we voluntarily imposed on ourself,
of committing to the press the history of <span class="sc">One Hundred and Forty-four

 As an example of the way Ring affairs were managed, we may note that, after 21
rounds in one hour and a quarter, the police really did come; that the men met the next
day, January 1, 1862, and the police, after three rounds in 17 minutes, again appeared, there
being strong ground for suspicion that they were sent for by telegram. Brettle having
sprained his ankle, a postponement was granted until March, and then they met (the bet of
£300 being off), and after four rounds, occupying one hour and 40 minutes, the referee gave
them 15 minutes to strike a blow; but as one wouldn’t and t’other didn’t, a “draw” was
declared, March 11, 1862.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Constant Reader!</span>”&mdash;&#8203;for surely he deserves that title who hath borne
me mental company through fifteen hundred pages&mdash;&#8203;this is an old-fashioned
<a name="Page_519" id="Page_519"></a><span class="pageno">519</span>
book, written by an old-fashioned “pen,” recording old-fashioned manners,
customs, and pursuits of men in times fast becoming old fashioned; it
therefore seems fit that, in the old fashion of the <span class="black">L’Envoy</span>, the Author
and the Reader should have a few “more last words” ere they part
company.</p>

<p>When Cid Hamet Benengeli, in the ultimate Chapter of “Don
Quixote,” apostrophises his pen, he speaks of scribblers “who compile
false and idle histories.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_42" id="fnanchor_42"></a><a href="#footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span>
Even so does the smaller author of <span class="sc">Pugilistica</span>
feel as he ceases from his “Story of the Ring.” It would seem from the
denunciation of the worthy Cid Hamet that in all times there have been
literary fabricators and forgers, and the writer can certify that the History
of the Ring in the present day has more than one flagrant instance.
Foremost of these is a weekly newspaper professing to be the Argus of the
Turf, and the Titan of Tipsters. The “Famous Old Fights” appearing in its
columns are pure fiction, grafted on well-known names, dates, and anecdotes
procurable from standard works of reference; the details of incidents, of
rounds, <abbr title="et cetera, et cetera">&amp;c., &amp;c.</abbr>, being the emanation of the lively imagination of the
newswriter, who, to our knowledge, and from innumerable instances in his
blundering romance, is utterly ignorant and innocent of any acquaintance
with the Ring, its professors, or the scenes he so inventively describes.
The sole reason for this <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exposé</span> is, that as, in many instances, these forged
accounts of battles purport to be between men whose combats are authentically
given in these pages, the reader should be made aware, that no such
reports exist in any contemporary publications, of which innumerable
proofs might be given, but that we cannot spare the space, time, and
trouble to “break a butterfly on the wheel.” Yet do we bear no grudge to
the ingenious fiction-writer; and having set the point of truth and accuracy
in its true light, we say, as did Uncle Toby, when he released the fly, “Go
thy ways, there is room enough in the world for both of us.”</p>

<p>And now for one other topic of our desultory gossip. In the later portions
of the Lives of the Boxers, we have had occasion to notice the
crusade which cant, cowardice, and hypocrisy successfully carried out to
the bitter end against pugilism and pugilists; we shall not here iterate
their defence or apology. To render, however, the work more complete
<a name="Page_520" id="Page_520"></a><span class="pageno">520</span>
as a reference, in times when even the first principles of fair-play to an
antagonist, and forbearance towards the vanquished seem to be little more
than a memory, and to be fast vanishing out of the minds of a pusillanimous
populace, we shall here preserve the text of the latest form of the
“Regulations” which governed the practice of honourable combat between
professional opponents in the <abbr title="Prize Ring">P.R.</abbr> The old Code, known as “Broughton’s
Rules,” are given in volume <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, page 25.</p>

<div class="fight">
<p class="p2">RULES OF THE RING, AS REVISED BY THE
PUGILISTIC ASSOCIATION.</p>

<p>It having been found that many of the
Rules of the Ring are insufficient to provide
for the various contingencies which continually
arise in prize battles, an entire revision
has been determined on, and a committee of
gentlemen, members of the Pugilistic Association,
undertook the task. When the
revision was complete, the laws were submitted
to a general meeting of the members
of the Prize Ring (being members of the
Association) and unanimously agreed to.</p>


<p><span class="sc">Rule 1.</span>&mdash;&#8203;That the ring shall be made on
turf, and shall be four-and-twenty feet
square formed of eight stakes and ropes, the
latter extending in double lines, the uppermost
line being four feet from the ground,
and the lower two feet from the ground.
That in the centre of the ring a mark be
formed, to be termed “the scratch;” and
that at two opposite corners, as may be
selected, spaces be enclosed by other marks
sufficiently large for the reception of the
seconds and bottle-holders, to be entitled
“the corners.”</p>

<p>     2.&mdash;&#8203;That each man shall be attended to
the ring by a second and a bottle-holder,
the former provided with a sponge, and the
latter with a bottle of water. That the
combatants, on shaking hands, shall retire
until the seconds of each have tossed for
choice of position, which adjusted, the
winner shall choose his corner according to
the state of the wind or sun, and conduct
his man thereto; the loser taking the opposite
corner.</p>

<p>     3.&mdash;&#8203;That each man shall be provided with
a handkerchief of a colour suitable to his own
fancy, and that the seconds proceed to
entwine these handkerchiefs at the upper
end of one of the centre stakes. That these
handkerchiefs shall be called the “colours;”
and that the winner of the battle at its conclusion
shall be entitled to their possession
as the trophy of victory.</p>

<p>     4.&mdash;&#8203;That two umpires shall be chosen by
the seconds or backers to watch the progress
of the battle, and take exception to any
breach of the rules hereafter stated. That
a referee shall be chosen by the umpires,
unless otherwise agreed on, to whom all disputes
shall be referred; and that the decision
of this referee, whatever it may be,
shall be final and strictly binding on all
parties, whether as to the matter in dispute
or the issue of the battle. That the umpires
shall be provided with a watch for the purpose
of calling time; and that they mutually
agree upon which this duty shall devolve,
the call of that umpire only to be attended
to, and no other person whatever to interfere
in calling time. That the referee shall
withhold all opinion till appealed to by the
umpires, and that the umpires strictly abide
by his decision without dispute.</p>

<p>     5.&mdash;&#8203;That on the men being stripped it
shall be the duty of the seconds to examine
their drawers, and if any objection arise as
to insertion of improper substances therein,
they shall appeal to their umpires, who, with
the concurrence of the referee, shall direct
what alterations shall be made.</p>

<p>     6.&mdash;&#8203;That in future no spikes be used in
fighting boots except those authorised by the
Pugilistic Association, which shall not
exceed three-eighths of an inch from the
sole of the boot, and shall not be less than
one-eighth of an inch broad at the point;
and it shall be in the power of the referee
to alter, or file in any way he pleases,
spikes which shall not accord with the above
dimensions, even to filing them away altogether.</p>

<p>     7.&mdash;&#8203;That both men being ready, each man
shall be conducted to that side of the scratch
next his corner previously chosen; and the
seconds on the one side, and the men on the
other, having shaken hands, the former shall
immediately return to their corners, and
there remain within the prescribed marks
till the round be finished, on no pretence
whatever approaching their principals during
the round, under a penalty of 5s. for each
offence, at the option of the referee. The
penalty, which will be strictly enforced, to
go to the funds of the Association. The
principal to be responsible for every fine
inflicted on his second.</p>

<p>     8.&mdash;&#8203;That at the conclusion of the round,
<a name="Page_521" id="Page_521"></a><span class="pageno">521</span>
when one or both of the men shall be down,
the seconds and bottle-holders shall step
forward and carry or conduct their principal
to his corner, there affording him the necessary
assistance, and that no person whatever
be permitted to interfere in this duty.</p>

<p>     9.&mdash;&#8203;That on the expiration of thirty
seconds the umpire appointed shall cry
“Time,” upon which each man shall rise
from the knee of his bottleholder and walk
to his own side of the scratch unaided; the
seconds and bottle-holders remaining at
their corner; and that either man failing so
to be at the scratch within eight seconds,
shall be deemed to have lost the battle.
This rule to be strictly adhered to.</p>

<p>     10.&mdash;&#8203;That on no consideration whatever
shall any person be permitted to enter the
ring during the battle, nor till it shall have
been concluded; and that in the event of
such unfair practice, or the ropes or stakes
being disturbed or removed, it shall be
in the power of the referee to award the
victory to that man who in his honest
opinion shall have the best of the contest.</p>

<p>     11.&mdash;&#8203;That the seconds and bottle-holders
shall not interfere, advise, or direct the
adversary of their principal, and shall
refrain from all offensive and irritating
expressions, in all respects conducting themselves
with order and decorum, and confine
themselves to the diligent and careful discharge
of their duties to their principals.</p>

<p>     12.&mdash;&#8203;That in picking up their men, should
the seconds or bottle-holders wilfully injure
the antagonist of their principal, the latter
shall be deemed to have forfeited the battle
on the decision of the referee.</p>

<p>     13.&mdash;&#8203;That it shall be a fair “stand-up
fight,” and if either man shall wilfully throw
himself down without receiving a blow,
<em>whether blows shall have previously been exchanged
or not</em>, he shall be deemed to have
lost the battle; but that this rule shall not
apply to a man who in a close slips down from
the grasp of his opponent to avoid punishment,
or from obvious accident or weakness.</p>

<p>     14.&mdash;&#8203;That butting with the head shall be
deemed foul, and the party resorting to this
practice shall be deemed to have lost the
battle.</p>

<p>     15.&mdash;&#8203;That a blow struck when a man
is thrown or down, shall be deemed foul.
That a man with one knee and one hand on
the ground, or with both knees on the
ground, shall be deemed down; and a blow
given in either of those positions shall be
considered foul, providing always that, when
in such position the man so down shall not
himself strike or attempt to strike.</p>

<p>     16.&mdash;&#8203;That a blow struck below the waistband
shall be deemed foul, and that in a
close seizing an antagonist below the waist,
by the thigh, or otherwise, shall be deemed
foul.</p>

<p>     17.&mdash;&#8203;That all attempts to inflict injury by
gouging, or tearing the flesh with the fingers
or nails, and biting, shall be deemed foul.</p>

<p>     18.&mdash;&#8203;That kicking or deliberately falling
on an antagonist with the knees or otherwise
when down, shall be deemed foul.</p>

<p>     19.&mdash;&#8203;That all bets shall be paid as the
battle-money, after a fight, is awarded.</p>

<p>     20.&mdash;&#8203;That no person, under any pretence
whatever, shall be permitted to approach
nearer the ring than ten feet, with the exception
of the umpires and referee, and the
persons appointed to take charge of the
water or other refreshment for the combatants,
who shall take their seats close to
the corners selected by the seconds.</p>

<p>     21.&mdash;&#8203;That due notice shall be given by the
stakeholder of the day and place where the
battle-money is to be given up, and that he
be exonerated from all responsibility upon
obeying the direction of the referee; that all
parties be strictly bound by these rules; and
that in future all articles of agreement for
a contest be entered into with a strict and
willing adherence to the letter and spirit of
these rules.</p>

<p>     22.&mdash;&#8203;That in the event of magisterial or
other interference, or in case of darkness
coming on, the referee shall have the power
to name the time and place for the next
meeting, if possible on the same day, or as
soon after as may be.</p>

<p>     23.&mdash;&#8203;That, should the fight not be decided
on the day, all bets shall be drawn, unless
the fight shall be resumed the same week,
between Sunday and Sunday, in which case
the bets shall stand and be decided by the
event. The battle-money shall remain in
the hands of the stakeholder until fairly
won or lost by a fight, unless a draw be
mutually agreed upon.</p>

<p>     24.&mdash;&#8203;That any pugilist voluntarily quitting
the ring previous to the deliberate
judgment of the referee being obtained,
shall be deemed to have lost the fight.</p>

<p>     25.&mdash;&#8203;That on an objection being made by
the seconds or umpire the men shall retire to
their corners, and there remain until the decision
of the appointed authorities shall be
obtained; that if pronounced “foul,” the
battle shall be at an end, but if “fair,”
“time” shall be called by the party appointed,
and the man absent from the scratch
in eight seconds after shall be deemed to
have lost the fight. The decision in all cases
to be given promptly and irrevocably, for
which purpose the umpires and the referee
should be invariably close together.</p>

<p>     26.&mdash;&#8203;That if in a rally at the ropes a man
steps outside the ring to avoid his antagonist,
or to escape punishment, he shall forfeit the
battle.</p>

<p>     27.&mdash;&#8203;That the use of hard substances, such
as stone, or stick, or of resin, in the hand
during the battle shall be deemed foul, and
that on the requisition of the seconds of
either man, the accused shall open his hands
for the examination of the referee.</p>

<p>     28.&mdash;&#8203;That hugging on the ropes shall be
deemed foul. That a man held by the
neck against the stakes, or upon or against
<a name="Page_522" id="Page_522"></a><span class="pageno">522</span>
the ropes, shall be considered down, and all
interference with him in that position shall
be foul. That if a man in any way makes
use of the ropes or stakes to aid him in
squeezing his adversary he shall be deemed
the loser of the battle; and that if a man in
a close reaches the ground with his knees
his adversary shall immediately loose him
or lose the battle.</p>

<p>     29.&mdash;&#8203;That all stage fights be as nearly as
possible in conformity with the foregoing
rules.</p>

<p>We ask, in the name of humanity, too often taken in vain, a calm and
dispassionate perusal of these rules, confident that the appeal will at least
induce a more charitable opinion of the men who could frame and act upon
them than ignorance or prejudice would form. “It has been constantly
urged,” says an experienced writer, “as a ground of objection to the study
of the skilful use of the fist that it makes men pugnacious, and more ready
to seek than to evade a quarrel, in order that they may display their fancied
superiority. Observation and experience do not confirm this view.
We have almost invariably found (except with persons who cannot command
their temper, and if this be the case, whatever be their acquirements,
they will be equally without control) that the consciousness of power inclines
men to be less prone to quarrel, and more forbearing against an opponent.
Of this abundant proofs are to be found, not only among the ordinary
classes of society, but more particularly among professed pugilists, who,
with a few exceptions, are the last to invite a quarrel, and the first to seek
a reconciliation. Many instances are on record, and have passed under our
notice, in which the most respectable members of the Prize Ring have
actually submitted to positive insult rather than exercise their athletic
powers and take advantage of the weakness of an assailant. This calmness
of disposition, joined with perfect self-possession, is in fact one of the
most valuable attributes of a British boxer, and one of the best tests of
true courage. That there may be and are exceptions to this rule cannot
be denied; but all must concur in the proposition, that for the strong to
oppress the weak, or the scientific boxer to take advantage of an ignorant
and helpless opponent, is an act of cowardice deserving the utmost contempt.
The ruffian who would strike a woman is not less deserving of execration
than he who, for the mere purpose of displaying his scientific acquirements,
would assail another not equally gifted. The great end of pugilistic instruction
is, to instil into the mind of the pupil a manly and honourable
bearing, combined with personal confidence in the hour of danger; we
have no apprehensions, therefore, that its pursuit will lead to the abandonment
of those principles of self-respect and fair play which are alike
estimable in the minds of all classes.”

<p>And here we will once again ask the question, without fear of a valid
retort, “Has the experience of the last twenty years, read by the light
of our police reports, and the records of our criminal courts, shown any
improvement in the character of what are called ‘offences against the
person’?” On the contrary, familiarity with the use of deadly weapons,
of the knife in murderous varieties of “the bowie” the “Spanish,” “the
Arkansas tooth-pick,” the “knuckle-duster,” the many-chambered revolver,
with the stringent repression of all pugilistic conflict by an ever and over-vigilant
police, has undoubtedly led to swifter, more sanguinary, more
treacherous, and more deadly modes of settling those differences which
must arise, especially among the lower classes of society. To this humiliating
catalogue of brutality we may add the savage use of the iron-bound
clog, and the “running kick,” so fatally studied and practised by a section
of the community which in ruder and in better times would have scorned
such an unmanly mode of attack, and would not even have permitted it
where several spectators were gathered together. But alas! the outcome
of the decay and suppression of fair fighting is manifest; the doctrine of
assassination is publicly preached in the press and in public meetings, and
“the gospel of dynamite” is the latest development of the “superior
civilisation” of a people who</p>

<p>Whether fair and regulated prize-battles are destructive of life, and
absolutely and directly shorten the period of man’s longevity, may be fairly
a subject of inquiry. A few statistics may well give us pause before we
decide this point, which an insufficient investigation and popular prejudice
would pronounce in the affirmative, while a candid consideration of the
following table may prove the negative&mdash;&#8203;that is, as compared with many
other gymnastic and sporting exercises. Deaths in the prize-ring, or even as
the consequences of pugilistic encounters, do not show a marked diminution
of the term of human life, in the recorded instances of the ages of the most
celebrated professors and practitioners of the art of boxing:&mdash;</p>

<p>Our last plea shall be drawn from the records of the “collective wisdom”
of the nation, wherein we flatter ourselves manly common sense will find
little difficulty in discriminating the characters of the meddling, malignant
and persecuting preachers of the doctrine of “sweetness and light,”
from the generous and tolerant spirits who declined to use the powers of
government against the much-maligned Ring, its professors and patrons.</p>

<p>We have noted the wave of puritan cant which for some ten years
previous to 1860 had rolled over the land, and the force of which was long
after felt. In the last-named year it gave trouble and unrest in the Senate.</p>

<p>On the 13th of April, Mr. <span class="sc">Hadfield</span> gave notice, on presentation of a
petition, that he would call the attention of the Government to a meditated
breach of the peace, by a pugilistic contest to take place between an American
citizen and a British subject for a so-called Championship. He added the
extraordinary information that “the newspapers had given notice of the
<a name="Page_525" id="Page_525"></a><span class="pageno">525</span>
time and place (?); “therefore he asked the Secretary for the Home Department
whether he intended to take measures to put down such intended
disturbance of the public peace and prevent an exhibition so contrary to the
religious sense of the country at large&mdash;&#8203;(laughter)&mdash;&#8203;and he would further
ask whether the public might rely on his doing his best to prevent so brutal
and demoralising an exhibition to the rising generation as the announced
contest between this American gladiator and&mdash;&mdash;(Laughter prevented
the rest of the hon. member’s question reaching the reporters’ gallery.)</p>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Geo. C. Lewis</span>, rising, said: The contest between these redoubtable
champions (a laugh) has been brought under my notice, and I have transmitted
the letter to Sir Richard Mayne, who, I have no doubt, will take the
necessary steps to prevent a breach of the peace within the metropolitan
district. Beyond this I cannot assure my honourable friend; I cannot
venture to give any positive promise&mdash;&#8203;for if he is informed of the time and
place I am not, and I don’t think they are fixed&mdash;&#8203;it is, therefore, impossible
for me to say whether the police will succeed in preventing the “incursion”
in question. (Laughter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Hadfield</span> was by no means satisfied with the Right Honourable
gentleman’s answer, and should again raise the question.</p>

<p>The fight came off unsatisfactorily, as all the world knows. <cite>Punch</cite>, in
the following week, tells us (in his “Essence of Parliament”):&mdash;&#8203;“<cite>Commons.</cite>
More fun about the fight. Mr. Ewart admitted but deplored the interest
taken, and the questions raised upon this matter; but wanted to know
what power there was to suppress such doings, except the police power to
suppress riot? Sir G. G. Lewis was also at a loss to know how to deal
with our modern Dares and Entellus.”</p>

<p>A young Yorkshire noblemen, however, a newly-fledged M.P., Lord
Lovaine (now Earl of Beverley) sought to make political and religious
capital out of the affair. His lordship opened fire by an attack on the
directors of a certain railway company&mdash;&#8203;the South Eastern&mdash;&#8203;for “their
conduct in offering facilities for the conveyance of persons to these illegal
contests,” and to raise the question, my Lord Lovaine, “moved for copies
of any correspondence on this subject, which had passed between the
Government and the South Eastern Railway Company.” He also inquired
whether the Government had attempted to enforce the law, or whether
anything had been done to stop the practice of letting trains for the purpose
he mentioned.</p>

<p>To these impertinences, spiced with some personal inuendoes, Lord
<a name="Page_526" id="Page_526"></a><span class="pageno">526</span>
Palmerston replied in the following terms:&mdash;&#8203;“He would not argue the
technical legal question that a fight between two men&mdash;&#8203;not a fight of
enmity, but a trial of strength&mdash;&#8203;is, legally, a breach of the peace, and an
act that renders the parties liable to prosecution; nor whether the persons
who go to witness it are not, technically, involved in the charge. But, as
far as they are concerned, they may conceive it to be a very harmless
pursuit; some persons like what takes place; there may be a difference of
opinion, as a matter of taste, whether it is a spectacle one would wish to
see, or whether it is calculated to excite disgust. Some people look upon
it as an exhibition of manly courage, characteristic of the people of this
country. I saw the other day,” said his lordship, “a long extract from a
French newspaper, describing this fight as a type of the national character
for endurance, patience under suffering, of indomitable perseverance in
determined effort, and holding it up as a specimen of the manly and admirable
qualities of the British race (hear). All this is, of course, entirely a
matter of opinion; but really, setting aside the legal technicalities of the
case, I do not perceive why any number of persons, say 1,000 if you please,
who assemble to witness a prize fight, are in their own persons more guilty
of a breach of the peace than an equal number of persons who assemble to
witness a balloon ascent (laughter). There they stand; there is no breach
of the peace; they go to see a sight, and when that sight is over they
return, and no injury is done to any one. They only sit or stand on the
grass to witness the performance, and as to the danger to those who perform
themselves, I imagine the danger to life in the case of those who go
up in balloons is certainly greater (hear and laughter) than that of two
combatants who merely hit each other as hard as they can, but inflict no
permanent injury upon each other (hear, hear). I think there is moderation
in all things&mdash;&#8203;moderation in all opinions; and although it may or may
not be desirable that the law should be enforced&mdash;&#8203;whatever the law may
be&mdash;&#8203;still I do not think any advantage is gained or good done, either to
public morals or public feeling, by the sort of exaggerations in which the
noble lord has indulged. At the same time the motion is one to which I
see no objection, and therefore I do not oppose it.”</p>

<p>Some sparring took place, in the course of which Lord Lovaine taunted
the Premier with a love of pugilism, and with sanctioning rather than discouraging
these meetings. Mr. Scully also had a fling at the Premier.</p>

<p>Lord <span class="sc">Palmerston</span> replied as follows:&mdash;&#8203;“I distinctly stated that it was
ruled by legal authorities that such prize fights were breaches of the peace;
<a name="Page_527" id="Page_527"></a><span class="pageno">527</span>
but I protest, at the same time, against the exaggerated terms in which the
noble lord (Lord Lovaine) characterised the conduct of the spectators on
those occasions.”</p>

<p>“Colonel <span class="sc">Dickson</span> was surprised to hear his hon. friend (Mr. Scully)
take the noble lord at the head of the Government to task for the remarks
he had made on this occasion, for he (Colonel Dickson) could not understand
an Irishman objecting to fighting (a laugh). The noble viscount
(Palmerston) had not laid himself open to such taunts. He sat on a
different side of the House from the noble lord, and did not often find himself
in the same lobby with him on a division, but he would say for the noble
viscount that if he had one attribute more than another which endeared
him to his countrymen, it was his thoroughly English character and his love
for every manly sport (cheers). He (Colonel Dickson) never saw a prize
fight in his life; but he would say that the two men who fought on the
recent occasion showed qualities of which the whole English race had reason
to be proud, our own man in particular (laughter), who evinced powers of
endurance and an indomitable pluck which entitled him to the admiration
of his countrymen (cheers.) Many men in this country received honours
who did not so well deserve them. He did not think Parliament ought to
legislate with the view to put down manly sports; and, with regard to the
duties of magistrates the law was clearly laid down. Magistrates themselves
ought to know when to act and when to shut their eyes (a laugh).”</p>

<p>The returns were then ordered; but whether any such papers existed, or
of what use they were to the meddlesome movers, the world is to this day
in ignorance. We should say that the whole debate was a peg on which to
hang a sanctimonious attack to the glory of the “unco’ guid” assailants.
While on this topic we will add a well-authenticated anecdote which was
current at the time in the clubs.</p>

<p>While the Home Secretary (Sir G. Cornewall Lewis) was solemnly explaining
and admitting the illegality of Ring-fights, a well-known sporting
M.P. was collecting a “purse” for Sayers. Lord Palmerston came upon
the group, and was instantly arrested by the amateur collector. “My
lord, I want a sov. for Tom Sayers.” “A sov. for Sayers? Splendid
fellow that; I’ll give you five.” “Thank you, my lord; but the subscription
is limited to a single sov.” His lordship, with subdued alacrity, “Well,
here it is; but I wish it was five.” There were noblemen then, in soul as
in title; in humble life as in exalted. Do they survive, and have they the
courage even of their own opinions?</p>

1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&trade; License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg&trade; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
